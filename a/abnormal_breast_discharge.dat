We show that an abnormal tissue can be revealed from the total thickness map, which is virtually constructed by assuming a healthy and compressed breast. Specifically, regression analysis is first performed using the multi-energy images of the prepared calibration phantom that consists of two basis materials. Total thickness map is then constructed by linearly combining thickness maps of basis materials, where the optimal weights for combination are determined so that the uniformity of total breast thickness is maximized. It is noted that the proposed method does not need accurate attenuation coefficients of breast tissues.

40|$|Background: Breast cancer {{screening}} {{programs have been}} developed in few developing countries to aid curb the increasing burden.

Methodology: A prospective interventional study comparing two groups of patients with an <b>abnormal</b> <b>breast</b> clinical breast examination finding after breast cancer screening done ‘before’(control group) and ‘after’(intervention group) the introduction of patient navigation program. Patients in the before group received standard care prior to introduction of the navigation program, the after group were navigated. Seventy-six patients were recruited into the study over six months with 38 in each arm. They were followed up for thirty days. Time to return was recorded in days; timely return was defined as review within fourteen days, delayed return as review between fifteen and thirty days and defaulters as no review within thirty days. Results: The proportion of return in the non-navigated and navigated group was 23. 7 % and 57. 9 % respectively (OR 4. 8, [95 % CI 1. 62 - 14. 41] p = 0. 0018.) The proportion of timely return in the non-navigated and navigated group was 18. 4 % and 52. 6 % respectively.

The BI-RADS system is recommended for describing and classifying <b>abnormal</b> <b>breast</b> imaging findings. For a breast abscess, a percutaneous biopsy is recommended {{in the case of}} a mass or persistent symptoms (Grade C). For mastalgia, when breast imaging is normal, no MRI or breast biopsy is recommended (Grade C). Percutaneous biopsy is recommended for a BI-RADS category 4 - 5 mass (Grade B). For persistent erythematous nipple or atypical eczema lesions, a nipple biopsy is recommended (Grade C). For distortion and asymmetry, a vacuum core-needle biopsy is recommended due to the risk of underestimation by simple core-needle biopsy (Grade C). For BI-RADS category 4 - 5 microcalcifications without any ultrasound signal, a minimum 11 -G vacuum core-needle biopsy is recommended (Grade B). In the absence of microcalcifications on radiography cores additional samples are recommended (Grade B). For atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, radial scar and mucocele with atypia, surgical excision is commonly recommended (Grade C). Expectant management is feasible after multidisciplinary consensus. For these lesions, when excision margins are not clear, no new excision is recommended except for LCIS characterized as pleomorphic or with necrosis (Grade C). For grade 1 phyllodes tumor, surgical resection with clear margins is recommended. For grade 2 phyllodes tumor, 10 mm margins are recommended (Grade C).

Methods: A retrospective study of 1893 mothers delivering healthy term singletons at a Swiss university hospital from 1 / 2008 to 3 / 2009 determined the associations between multiple breastfeeding and early postpartum parameters by univariate and multiple regression analysis. Results: Multiparity was associated with nursing exclusively at the <b>breast</b> at <b>discharge</b> (P< 0. 001), less use of maltodextrin supplement (P< 0. 05), bottle/cup (both P< 0. 001), but more pacifier use (P< 0. 05). Among obese mothers, nursing exclusively at the <b>breast</b> at <b>discharge</b> was less frequent, and use of all feeding aids more frequent, than among normal-weight women (both P< 0. 001). Neuraxial anesthesia was associated with use of maltodextrin and bottle (both P< 0. 05) compared to no anesthesia. Delayed first skin-to-skin contact and rooming-in for < 24 h/day were each associated with maltodextrin and cup (P< 0. 05). Nursing exclusively at the <b>breast</b> at <b>discharge</b> was less frequent (P< 0. 001), and bottle use more frequent (P< 0. 05), in women with sore nipples than in those without.

40|$|Introduction: Neonatal {{mastitis}} is {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} breast frequently associated with Staphylococcus aureus. While Panton–Valentine leucocidin (PVL), a B-pore-forming cytotoxin, is commonly associated with enhanced virulence in community-acquired methicillinresistant S. aureus isolates, {{this is the first}} report to our knowledge of neonatal mastitis caused by PVL-positive S. aureus. Case presentation: A 20 -day-old full-term female neonate presented with bilateral mastitis, complicated by bilateral abscess formation. PVL toxin-positive S. aureus was cultured from aspirates of both breasts. All family members, none of whom presented with symptoms of infection, and, specifically, maternal vaginal samples proved negative for PVL-positive S. aureus. Successful resolution involved surgical drainage and clindamycin therapy. Conclusion: While PVL toxin-positive S. aureus has previously been implicated in bovine and ovine mastitis, there may now be a need for vigilance with respect to human incidence. Due to PVL-mediated tissue necrosis, breast abscess formation and poor response to conventional antimicrobial therapy should, perhaps, be a cause for suspicion of PVL-bearing S. aureus and expediting of appropriate therapy to avoid potential for long-term consequences such as <b>abnormal</b> <b>breast</b> development...|$|R

Methods Data sources for the cost-effectiveness analysis include data from published literature, secondary data from the NCI's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, and primary data from the CCNP. Results If women enrolled in CCNP receive breast cancer diagnosis earlier by 6 months as compared to usual care, then navigation is borderline cost-effective for $ 95, 625 per life-year saved.
