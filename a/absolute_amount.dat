25|$|Urban ecosystems, {{influenced}} as {{they are}} by the density of human buildings and activities differ considerably from those of their rural surroundings. Anthropogenic buildings and waste, as well as cultivation in gardens, create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in wilderness, in some cases enabling exceptional biodiversity. They provide homes not only for immigrant humans but also for immigrant plants, bringing about interactions between species which never previously encountered each other. They introduce frequent disturbances (construction, walking) to plant and animal habitats, creating opportunities for recolonization and thus favoring young ecosystems with r-selected species dominant. On the whole, urban ecosystems are less complex and productive than others, due to the diminished <b>absolute</b> <b>amount</b> of biological interactions.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the <b>absolute</b> <b>amount</b> of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E

500|$|Several {{studies have}} {{quantified}} {{the amounts of}} hallucinogenic compounds found in the fruit bodies of Psilocybe semilanceata. In 1993, Gartz reported an average of 1% psilocybin (expressed {{as a percentage of}} the dry weight of the fruit bodies), ranging from a minimum of 0.2% to a maximum of 2.37%, which is the highest psilocybin concentration reported for a mushroom. In an earlier analysis, Tjakko Stijve and Thom Kuyper (1985) found a high concentration in a single specimen (1.7%) in addition to a relatively high concentration of baeocystin (0.36%). Smaller specimens tend to have the highest percent concentrations of psilocybin, but the <b>absolute</b> <b>amount</b> is highest in larger mushrooms. A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old. Michael Beug and Jeremy Bigwood, analyzing specimens from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, reported psilocybin concentrations ranging from 0.62% to 1.28%, averaging 1.0±0.2%. They concluded that the species was one of the most potent, as well as the most constant in psilocybin levels. In a 1996 publication, Paul Stamets defined a [...] "potency rating scale" [...] based on the total content of psychoactive compounds (including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin) in 12 species of Psilocybe mushrooms. Although there are certain caveats with this technique—such as the unconfirmed assumption that these compounds contribute equally to psychoactive properties—it serves as a rough comparison of potency between species. Despite its small size, Psilocybe semilanceata is considered a [...] "moderately active to extremely potent" [...] hallucinogenic mushroom (meaning the combined percentage of psychoactive compounds is typically between 0.25% to greater than 2%), and of the 12 mushrooms compared, only 3 were more potent: P.azurescens, P.baeocystis, and P.bohemica. According to Gartz (1995), P.semilanceata is Europe's most popular psychoactive species.|$|E

Rejections are reportedly independent of the stakes at this level, with 30 USD offers being turned down in Indonesia, as in the United States, even though this equates to two weeks' wages in Indonesia. However, 2011 research with stakes of up to 40 weeks' wages in India showed that [...] "as stakes increase, rejection rates approach zero".|$|E

60|$|I {{have said}} that the nocturnal {{radiation}} in the English spring months is the great obstacle to the cultivation of many Himalayan plants; but it is not therefore to be inferred that there is no similar amount of radiation in the Himalaya; for, on the contrary, in April its amount is much greater than in England, frequently equalling 13 degrees of difference; and I have seen 16 degrees at 7,500 feet; but the minimum temperature at the time is 51 degrees, and the <b>absolute</b> <b>amount</b> of cold therefore immaterial. The mean minimum of London is 38 degrees, and, when lowered 5.5 degrees by radiation, the consequent cold is very considerable.

40|$|Seven major reanalyses of {{precipitable water}} (PW) are {{compared}} in this paper. In addition, using a regional climate model, we also investigated {{the impact of}} the boundary conditions on downscaling simulations in the tropics with a particular focus on the differences in the absolute value of PW among reanalyses. Results showed that the <b>absolute</b> <b>amounts</b> of PW in some reanalyses were very small compared to the observation, although most spatial patterns of PW in the reanalyses agreed closely with the observation. Particularly over the tropics, most of reanalyses tended to have dry biases throughout the annual cycle. The range of inter-reanalysis dispersion in the tropical mean PW is very large compared with their seasonal variations of the tropical mean PW. In addition, the discrepancies of the 12 -yr mean PW in July over the Southeast Asian monsoon region among the reanalyses exceeded their inter-annual standard deviation of the PW. Therefore, the inter-reanalyses dispersion in the tropical PW is significantly large. We also conducted the downscaling experiments, which were forced by the different four reanalyses. The spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric circulation, including monsoon westerlies and various disturbances, were very similar among the reanalyses. However, the simulated precipitation was 40 % less than the observed precipitation amounts, although the dry bias in the boundary conditions was only 6 %, and the simulated atmospheric circulation was also basically the same. This result indicates that the dry bias has large effects on precipitation in downscaling experiments over the tropics even if atmospheric circulation is well simulated. Downscaled models can provide realistic simulations of regional tropical climates only if the boundary conditions include realistic <b>absolute</b> <b>amounts</b> of PW. Use of boundary conditions that include realistic <b>absolute</b> <b>amounts</b> of PW in downscaling in the tropics is imperative at the present time...|$|R
