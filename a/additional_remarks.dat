500|$|Jackson did not {{discover}} the remarks {{until they were}} published again in January 1817 {{in response to a}} Boston newspaper's criticism of Kentucky militiamen. [...] He wrote to the Kentucky Reporter at that time, denouncing the remarks as a forgery. [...] The Reporter investigated and published an explanation of how Thomas's remarks had been attributed to Jackson. [...] They did not reprint Jackson's letter because they felt his claim that the remarks had been intentionally forged—a charge which was now found to be false—was too inflammatory. [...] The editors promised that if their retraction did not satisfy Jackson, they would fully publish any of his <b>additional</b> <b>remarks</b> on the subject. [...] In Jackson's April 1817 response, he implied that Adair had intentionally misrepresented the remarks, and reasserted that they had been forged, possibly by Adair himself. [...] Adair believed Jackson's references to the remarks as a [...] "forged dish, dressed in the true Spanish style" [...] was a thinly veiled reference to Adair's alleged participation in the Burr conspiracy. [...] As ostensible proof that he was not predisposed against Kentuckians, Jackson also implied that he had not reported additional dishonorable behavior by Kentucky militiamen during the battle. [...] This letter thrust the dispute into the national spotlight and prompted Adair to resume correspondence with him both to defend Davis's men and refute Jackson's charges of conspiracy. [...] In his May 1817 response, he reasserted his defense of the Kentucky militiamen at New Orleans and dismissed many of Jackson's allegations as unimportant and untrue. [...] He flatly denied the existence of a conspiracy, and chastised Jackson for making charges without supporting evidence. [...] Responding to Jackson's allusion to Spain, Adair recalled that Jackson had also been implicated with Burr.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{different}} types of scouts, some enlisted as Indian Scouts for brief terms and there were others who were hired as scouts by the U.S. Army. Some individual may have served at different times as a hired scout and an enlisted scout. Prior to the act in 1866 these scouts were considered employees rather than soldiers. Enlistment records and muster rolls, from 1866 to 1912 were in many instances filed by state, some records were broken down by company or military post providing information such as when, where, and by whom the scout was enlisted; period of enlistment; place of birth; age at time of enlistment; physical description; and possibly <b>additional</b> <b>remarks</b> such as discharge information, including date and place of discharge, rank at the time, and if the scout died in service. Indian scouts who were officially enlisted in the army after 1866 were issued old pattern uniforms from surplus stock legally exempt from sale. [...] Their uniforms were worn with less regulation, sometimes mixed with their native dress. In 1870, Captain Bourke of the 3rd cavalry described Apache scouts in Arizona as “almost naked, their only clothing being a muslin loin-cloth, a pair of point toed moccasins and a hat of hawk feather”. In 1876 a description of Crow Scouts reads that they wore, [...] “an old black army hat with top cut out and sides bound round with feathers, fur and scarlet cloth”. [...] With the availability of army clothing some Native scouts {{took advantage of the}} availability of the clothing. In 1902 when new regulations were introduced in March the U.S. Scouts received a new more regulated uniform.|$|E

40|$|A complex Lie {{supergroup}} can {{be described}} as a real Lie supergroup with integrable almost complex structure. The necessary and sufficient conditions on an almost complex structure on a real Lie supergroup for defining a complex Lie supergroup are deduced. The classification of real Lie supergroups with such almost complex structures yields a new approach to the known classification of complex Lie supergroups by complex Harish-Chandra superpairs. A universal complexification of a real Lie supergroup is constructed. Comment: This is a condensed version of the previous file with <b>additional</b> <b>remark...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{symmetry}} breaking in a quantum phase transition on pairwise entanglement in spin- 1 / 2 models. We give a set of conditions on correlation functions a model has to meet {{in order to keep}} the pairwise entanglement unchanged by a parity symmetry breaking. It turns out that all mean-field solvable models do meet this requirement, whereas the presence of strong correlations leads to a violation of this condition. This results in an order-induced enhancement of entanglement, and we report on two examples where this takes place. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, revtex 4.

We then show this category is isomorphic to the category of vertex operator coalgebras, which is defined {{in the language of}} formal algebra. The latter has several characteristics which give it the flavor of a coalgebra with respect to the structure of a vertex operator algebra and several characteristics that distinguish it from a standard dual [...] both will be mentioned.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} realizability {{interpretation}} of a system for quantifier free arithmetic which {{is equivalent to the}} fragment of classical arithmetic without nested quantifiers, which we call EM 1 -arithmetic. We interpret classical proofs as interactive learning strategies, namely as processes going through several stages of knowledge and learning by interacting with the “environment ” and with each other. With respect to known constructive interpretations of classical arithmetic, the present one differs under many respects: for instance, the interpretation is compositional in a strict sense; in particular the interpretation of (the analogous of) the cut rule is the plain composition of functionals. As an <b>additional</b> <b>remark,</b> any two quantifier-free formulas provably equivalent in classical arithmetic have the same realizer. ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is three-fold. First is to clarify the {{connection}} between the dominant energy condition and hyperbolicity properties of Lagrangian field theories. Second is to provide further analysis on the breakdown of hyperbolicity for the Skyrme model, sharpening the results of Crutchfield and Bell and comparing against a result of Gibbons, and provide a local well-posedness result for the dynamical problem in the Skyrme model. Third is to provide a short summary of the framework of regular hyperbolicity of Christodoulou for the relativity community. In the process, a general theorem about dominant energy conditions for Lagrangian theories of maps is proved, as well as several results concerning hyperbolicity of those maps.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} a new method {{for the construction of}} unique strong solutions of a larger class of stochastic delay equations driven by a discontinuous drift vector field and a Wiener process. The results obtained in this paper can be regarded as an infinite-dimensional generalization of those of A. Y. Veretennikov [42] in the case of certain stochastic delay equations with irregular drift coefficients. The approach proposed in this work rests on Malliavin calculus and arguments of a "local time variational calculus", which may also be used to study other types of stochastic equations as e. g. functional Itô-stochastic differential equations in connection with path-dependent Kolmogorov equations [15].
