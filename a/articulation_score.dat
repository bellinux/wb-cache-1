40|$|Of the 17 {{handicapped}} pupils, 15 of {{them were}} sensori-neural and 2 {{of them were}} mixed type hearing loss, all having 42 - 82 db hearing loss in average of speech range and educated in the special class for hard of hearing over one year. Examinations were made as to their past history, audiometry, effects of hearing aid with lipreading, intelligibility of monosyllables, words and sentences, and hearing acuity, conversation intelligibility, sentence structure and training effect, and those results were compared with those in preceding one year. Principal findings are summarized as follows: 1) <b>Articulation</b> <b>score</b> of monosyllables of the pupils educated for over one year in the special class for hard of hearing {{was found to be}} 92. 0 % in maximum, 38. 7 % in minimum and 65. 9 % in average of the total pupils, in contrast to 85. 0 % in maximum, 26. 7 % in minimum and 52. 4 % in average of the total pupils in previous one year. 2) The <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> at the first examination was in such an order as the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> of monosyllables 52. 4 % in average, of sentences 71. 8 % and of words 74. 1 %, and in the second year examination, the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> of monosyllables 65. 9 %, of words 81. 0 % and of sentences 84. 5 %. From the above results, it seems to be clear that <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> can be improved with the hearing and speech training even in the perceptive deaf children. 3) In the all 17 pupils examined including 5 pupils who educated for one year at the special class, the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> of monosyllables have a inverse correlation with the level of hearing loss, and this is more marked in only the 12 pupils with over 2 years' education. 4) The pupils whose <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> of sentences were found to be 100 % had showed their average hearing in speech range in 42 - 67 db loss, and their <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> of monosyllables were in 56. 0 % - 75. 3 %. 5) It is found that those pupils with over three years' speech and language training could master themselves to utilize fully their articulation capabilities in pproportion to their hearing level. 6) It is concluded that for the children with impaired hearing the basic training for speech accompanied by language training should be started by the age of 3 years at the latest and completed before entering the primary school, and in the special class for such children the emphasis should be placed more on phrases and sentences rather than on monosyllbales and words...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} to {{determine}} what effects operative hearing restoration would hays on the speech and language development, this study was carried out on 13 cases of deaf children aged 8 - 16 years with bilateral congenital middle ear malformation whose hearing acuity was restored within 30 db loss in average of speech range by standard fenestration operation or stapes surgery and maintained {{one year after the}} operation. Examination was carried out on the hearing ability, intelligence, lipreading, intelligibility of articulation for monosyllables, words and sentences, conversation intelligibility, sonagram of monosyllables, time of reading, total disfluency index, vocabulary and sentence structures, and these results after the operation were compared with those before the operation. The results of the study briefly presented in the following. 1) The <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> for monosyllables, words and sentences by pronounciation was moderately improved except in two children of delayed mental development. The obtained <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> was in the ascending order of monosyllables, words and sentences. 2) In two children with delayed mental development the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> improvement was only slight as compared with the other children. 3) With exception of two cases the operation for hearing restoration was found to have increased the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> for syllables more than fifty percent. 4) The intelligence quotient, conversation intelligibility and total disfluency index were not improved so much as expected. 5) The number of childrens' vocabulary increased markedly after the operation. 6) For the development of speech and language in deaf children with bilateral malformation of conductive apparatus, it is desirable to diagnose as early as possible in order to enable earlier operation for hearing improvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{subjective}} Chinese (Mandarin) <b>articulation</b> <b>scores</b> of a {{total of}} 50 sound conditions, namely at 12 receiver positions in four rooms, were obtained by expert listeners based on in-situ measured binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) and binaural technology for headphone reproduction from a phonetically balanced test. The relationship between Chinese speech <b>articulation</b> <b>scores</b> and the speech transmission index (STI) according to IEC 60268 - 16 was established. The spectrum difference between the average spectrum of Chinese and that recommended by IEC may noticeably influence the measurement results with a STI difference of up to 0. 054. However, the STI method can evaluate Chinese intelligibility without modulating the correction factor values recommended by IEC; the standard deviation between the <b>articulation</b> <b>scores</b> and the curve was 5. 70 %, which is relatively small...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{assessment}} of articulation and prosody {{is an important}} aid for speech theraphy and language education. In this paper, we focus on speech theraphy for hearing-impairment and propose methods for automatic <b>articulation</b> and prosody <b>scoring.</b> The pronunciation problems of the hearing-impaired are briefly discussed. Three methods are developed for automatic pronunciation scoring for the hearingimpaired. In the first method, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based phoneme recognition and forcedalignment are employed for detecting articulation problems. The second method performs prosody scoring by operating at the syllable level and comparing the pitch and energy contours of a given utterance with a reference utterance. Finally, speech-to-text alignment information is used for duration scoring of a test utterance with a reference utterance. The proposed methods are evaluated on a database collected from native Turkish speakers. The <b>articulation</b> <b>scoring</b> method improves the correct recognition rate of confusable pairs of words by 5. 6 % yielding a correct recognition rate of 84. 8 %. The results also show that the prosody and duration scoring algorithms provide useful information to assess the match between the prosodic characteristics of two speakers. 1...|$|R

The threshold for pure tones and speech can be accurately established and at subsequent examinations can be confirmed or compared, with a fair amount of precision. The <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> for phonetically balanced words can be determined and so can the effect of amplification on such scores. The conductive and the cochlear component of hearing loss can be distinguished with a fair amount of reliability from what is called the "sensorineural" or the "retrocochlear component"...|$|E
40|$|The {{auditory}} filter {{of hearing}} impaired is wider {{than that of}} normal hearing people. Thus, the frequency selectivity decreases because of increased of masking effects. We have focused on this wider auditory filter shape and developed a method in which the critical band is compressed along the frequency axis. We also implemented a system based on the proposed algorithms using "SIMULINK. " To test our method, we conducted two experiments. The first evaluated the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and the second was an articulation test. The quality and intelligibility of speech sounds were improved in Exp. 1. In Exp. 2, the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> was also improved when frequencies were compressed. These results show the feasibility of frequency compression algorithm for the hearing impaired people. There were many studies on the human auditory filter and the critical band (e. g., Fletcher [1] and Zwicker [2]). Patterson measured an auditory filter using notched-noise method [3]. Glasberg and Moore measured an auditory filter of hearing impaired an...|$|E
40|$|Cochlear implant {{systems have}} been {{developed}} and used for many patients, however, the processing system is still imperfect in transferring speech information. Usually, processing is evaluated {{with the cooperation of}} implanted patients, but this implies difficulties and limits the application. Obviously the speech processor needs to be improved because it extracts only limited speech features. In order to accelerate improvements, we developed acoustic simulator hardware which is in-tended to imitate the stimulation received by implanted patients. It consists of a set of active filters with operational amplifier circuits, like the original speech processor. Hard-wired analog circuits are used to achieve real time examination on various sources of speech material. The acoustic process and electro-neuro-physiological process in action around the electrode implanted into the cochlea and haircell nerve were with band pass filters and stimulation pulse trains which are amplitude modulated. This system has been evaluated under several condi-tions, such as monosyllables, words, and sentences. Comparison with other re-ports, our results have shown that this hardware simulation approximately match-es the <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> of implanted patients. This simulator developed here provides a useful tool for evaluation of acoustic processing and parameter coding schemes for cochlear implant systems. 1...|$|E

Computer assisted language learning has evolved from simple interactive software that access the learner’s knowledge in grammar and vocabulary to more advanced systems that accept speech input {{as a result of the}} recent development of speech recognition[1]. Therefore many computer based self teaching systems have been developed for several languages such English, Deutsch and Chinese, however for Arabic; the research is still in its beginning. This study is part of the “Arabic Pronunciation improvement system for Malaysian Teachers of Arabic language” project which aimed at developing computer based systems for standards Arabic language instruction for Malaysian teachers of Arabic language. The system aims to help teachers to learn Arabic language quickly by focusing on the listening and speaking comprehension (receptive skills) to improve their pronunciation[2, 3]. In this paper we addressed the problem of giving marks for Arabic pronunciation by using a Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), thus our approach to pronunciation scoring is based on the HMM log-likelihood probability. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} nonlinear frequency compression (NLFC) on children's development of speech and language at three years of age. Design: A randomized controlled trial was conducted as part of the population-based longitudinal study on outcomes of children with hearing impairment (LOCHI). Participants were randomly assigned to fitting with NLFC (Phonak Naida V SP or UP) or with conventional processing in hearing aids, prescribed by using either the NAL or the DSL formula. Standardized tests of speech production, receptive and expressive language were administered, and parent ratings were collected. All assessments were double-blinded. Study sample: Participants were 44 of the 450 children in the LOCHI cohort. Results: Compared to children using conventional processing, receptive and expressive language was higher but receptive vocabulary and consonant <b>articulation</b> <b>scores</b> were lower for children who use NLFC. There was increased substitution of affricates by fricatives for children using NLFC, compared to children using conventional amplification. After allowing for the effect of multiple demographic variables, the difference in global language scores between groups was not significant (effect: 0. 8 [95 % confidence interval: − 6. 7, 8. 3]). Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in language ability between children using NLFC and those using conventional amplification. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Auditory and {{audio-visual}} speech {{perception was}} investigated using auditory signals of invariant spectral envelope that temporally encoded {{the presence of}} voiced and voiceless excitation, variations in amplitude envelope and F- 0. In experiment 1, {{the contribution of the}} timing of voicing was compared in consonant identification to the additional effects of variations in F- 0 and the amplitude of voiced speech. In audio-visual conditions only, amplitude variation slightly increased accuracy globally and for manner features. F- 0 variation slightly increased overall accuracy and manner perception in auditory and audio-visual conditions. Experiment 2 examined consonant information derived from the presence and amplitude variation of voiceless speech in addition to that from voicing, F- 0, and voiced speech amplitude. Binary indication of voiceless excitation improved accuracy overall and for voicing and manner. The amplitude variation of voiceless speech produced only a small increment in place of <b>articulation</b> <b>scores.</b> A final experiment examined audio-visual sentence perception using encodings of voiceless excitation and amplitude variation added to a signal representing voicing and F- 0. There was a contribution of amplitude variation to sentence perception, but not of voiceless excitation. The timing of voiced and voiceless excitation appears to be the major temporal cues to consonant identity. (C) 1999 Acoustical Society of America. [S 0001 - 4966 (99) 01410 - 1]...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the acquisition of speaking skills in an online distance education course of 19 first semester Spanish learners. The possibility of oral development in a strictly online course was examined based on students ' pronunciation production in two types of recorded speaking activities and in two real-time conversations. Students created two types of voiced audio e-mails each week during the semester: read aloud passages and grammar-drill completions. In order to determine whether students ' pronunciation indeed improved {{over the course of}} the semester, their performance on these two types of audio e-mails were compared at the beginning of the semester and at the end of the semester. In addition, students participated in two Internet-mediated oral conversations with their instructor using MSN messaging at the mid-term week and final week of the semester. Three kinds of data were collected from the conversations: an <b>articulation</b> <b>score</b> (articulation = pronunciation, stress, and intonation), an accuracy score, and a proficiency score. Students ' performance on these interviews provided further evidence regarding the development of their oral skills. The findings suggest that only in the area of oral proficiency were there significant gains in scores...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} centre-level {{variation in}} speech intervention and outcome and {{factors associated with}} a speech disorder in children in Cleft Care UK (CCUK). Setting and Sample Population: Two hundred and sixty-eight 5 -year-old British children with non-syndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate recruited to CCUK. Materials and Methods: Centre-based therapists undertook audio-video recordings. Perceptual analysis was undertaken using the CAPS-A tool. Speech outcomes were based on structural and <b>articulation</b> <b>scores,</b> and intelligibility/distinctiveness. Between-centre variation in treatment and outcomes were examined using multilevel models. These models were extended to estimate the association between a range of factors (hearing loss, speech intervention, fistula, secondary speech surgery for velopharyngeal insufficiency, socio-economic status, gender, and parental happiness with speech) and speech outcomes. Results: There was centre-level variation in secondary speech surgery, speech intervention, structure and intelligibility outcomes. Children {{with a history of}} speech intervention had a lower odds of poor intelligibility/distinctiveness, 0. 1 (95 % CI: 0. 0 - 0. 4). Parental concern was associated with a higher odds of poor intelligibility/distinctiveness, 13. 2 (95 % CI: 4. 9 - 35. 1). Poor speech outcomes were associated with a fistula, secondary speech surgery and history of hearing loss. Conclusions: Within the centralized service there is centre-level variation in secondary speech surgery, intervention and speech outcomes. These findings support the importance of early management of fistulae, effective management of velopharyngeal insufficiency and hearing impairment, and most importantly speech intervention in the preschool years. Parental concern about speech is a good indicator of speech status...|$|R
40|$|Thirty five-, six- and seven-year-old male children, {{who were}} {{diagnosed}} as having a functional articulation disorder, were administered tests of speech sound production and discrimination to investigate the hypothesized relationship between these two functions. The Goldman-Fristoe-Woodcock Test of Auditory Discrimination was used to obtain discrimination responses. The same instrument was adapted to obtain articulation responses from the identical word-picture stimulus items. An articulatory-based distinctive feature system was employed to analyse both articulation and discrimination responses. Univariate statistics performed on the <b>articulation</b> and discrimination <b>scores</b> revealed a lack of sig-nificant correlation and a superiority of discrimination over articulation performance. Dis-criminant analysis revealed further that articulation and discrimination profiles, constructed from feature scores, were statistically distinct.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{assemble}} in one source as much of the historical data pertinent to the D Major Cello Concerto of Joseph Haydn as is possible in such a work. Many articles have been written over the years concerning this concerto. The major concern of these articles has been whether or not Haydn actually composed the D Major Cello Concerto. All of the known arguments will be approached and discussed and some conclusions will be drawn. It is interesting to note that all such arguments were published before the whereabouts of the autograph manuscript was widely known. The present author was able to obtain a microfilm copy of the autograph from the Austrian National Library in Vienna to whom he is deeply indebted. This microfilm has proven itself invaluable in this study. Many references to the autograph will be made throughout this work, especially in Chapters Three and Four, dealing with the Gevaert changes and the current editions of the concerto. This leads to a second purpose of this paper. That purpose is to determine which of the current editions of the D Major Cello Concerto follows the manuscript most accurately. There have been many published editions of this concerto and presently there are more than eight to choose from. The decision of which edition to use when studying this piece is largely a matter of personal taste, but one should take into consideration whether or not the edition used is authentic. At this time there is an appalling lack of critical editions in the cello repertiore, with only the Bach Suites and the Beethoven and Brahms Sonatas available in such editions. Critical editions do not always contain the most effective bowing and fingering indications, but a well-schooled player can reach his own conclusions concerning correct notes, dynamics, phrases and <b>articulations.</b> Authentic <b>scores</b> eliminate the questionable indications of ill-informed and misguided editions; the serious music student will try to determine what the composer really wanted. It is the real concern of this author that in the forthcoming years there will be more critical editions of the cello repertoire made available to both students and teachers.
