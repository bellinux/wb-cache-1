It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large.

6000|$|About this time, Pope {{commenced}} {{preparations for}} the great work of translating Homer; and subscription-papers, accordingly, were issued. Dean Swift was now in England, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest {{in the success of}} this undertaking, recommending it in coffee-houses, and introducing the subject and Pope's name to the leading Tories. Pope met the Dean {{for the first time in}} Berkshire, where, in one of his fits of savage disgust at the conflicting parties of the period, he had retired to the house of a clergyman, and an intimacy commenced which was only terminated by death. We have often regretted that Pope had not selected some author more suitable to his genius than Homer. Horace or Lucretius, or even Ovid, would have been more congenial. His imitations of Horace shew us what he might have made of a complete translation. What a brilliant thing a version of Lucretius, in the style of the [...] "Essay on Man," [...] would have been! And his [...] "Rape of the Lock" [...] proves that he had considerable sympathy with the elaborate fancy, although not with the meretricious graces of Ovid. But with Homer, the severely grand, the simple, the warlike, the lover and painter of all Nature's old original forms--the ocean, the mountains, and the stars--what thorough sympathy could a man have who never saw a real mountain or a battle, and whose enthusiasm for scenery was confined to purling brooks, trim gardens, artificial grottos, and the shades of Windsor Forest? Accordingly, his Homer, although a beautiful and sparkling poem, is not a satisfactory translation of the [...] "Iliad," [...] and still less of the [...] "Odyssey." [...] He has trailed along the naked lances of the Homeric lines so many flowers and leaves that you can hardly recognise them, and feel that their point is deadened and their power gone. This at least is our opinion; although many to this day continue to admire these translations, and have even said that if they are not Homer, they are something better.|$|E

We will pick up these discussions <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look at probabilities in scenario development. We divide our consideration into three parts in order to do this: the use of probabilities within the scenario creation process; the attachment of probabilities to the developed scenarios; and probabilities in the scenario controlling process.|$|R

5000|$|During this live {{televised}} draft lottery ceremony, {{the league}} used {{a system where}} sealed envelopes representing the teams with the worst records were mixed in a tumbler, and then drawn by NBA Commissioner David Stern {{one at a time}} to determine which of these clubs would get the first pick onwards. However, when these envelopes were added to the tumbler, one envelope was put in forcibly and banged against the edge, bending the corner, while {{all the rest of the}} envelopes were set in gently. Stern closely watched the tumbler spinning <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath when drawing for the first pick, and went for the envelope with the bent corner, which upon opening the envelope, it was revealed that the New York Knicks logo was inside. The large-market New York Knicks, who finished with the third-worst record in the league that season, eventually used the first pick to draft Ewing with (who would become a legend on the team, leading the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. Although the Knicks also reached the 1999 NBA Finals, Ewing was injured). Nevertheless, the [...] "bent envelope" [...] fueled speculation that the league staged the result.|$|E

40|$|The broad {{literature}} {{documents the}} empirical regularity that {{slope of the}} term structure of interest rates is a reliable predictor of future real economic activity. Steeper slopes presage increasing growth, and downward sloping term structures presage declining growth or even recession. Some instances of slope's misleading signals were recorded in 2006 (the term structure was flat, indicating decline in economic activity when high growth continued) and 2008 (the term structure was very steep, predicting economic growth when recession continued <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> dive). Moreover, Breeden (2012 a) showed that the term structure of interest rates has had less predictive power over {{the past fifty years}} than has been found in earlier researches over shorter periods of time. The key idea underlying this paper was to test whether the term structure of volatility and the term structure of inflation combined with the term spread could improve predictions of future economic growth compared to interest rate based forecasts with only one variable. This study finds that while the term structure spread and volatility appear to be statistically significant variables there is little evidence of improved performance compare to interest rate based forecasts with only one variable. by Maria Khait.

Johnston said : Before proceeding with the business of the evening, he would like to say he was sure all very gladly welcomed back amongst them their esteemed secretary, Mr. Alex. Morton. Mr. Morton had accomplished good work in Western Australia, and had enriched both the Museums of Western Australia and Tasmania to a very great extent. He was very pleased indeed to see him back and looking so well and hearty, and was glad now to re-commit to him the small part of the duties he had performed during his (Mr. Mortons) absence. Mr. Morton wished to thank Mr. R. M. Johnston and Mr. Rodway for having so kindly acted in his absence. He was not going to say anything that evening about his trip, because there was a full programme already, and he would defer the subject till their first meeting next session. Mr. Morton recommended to the meeting for election, as corresponding members, the following gentlemen of Western Australia, who had rendered him much help whilst in the colony, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in this society. They were :—Mr. B. H. Woodward, Curator Perth Museum; W. J. Greenard, Inspector of Mines, Cue, western division; and Mr. H. B. Walsh, Police Magistrate, Upper Murehison, Mileura Station, West Australia, Mr. Greenard helped him very considerably. Indeed, {{he did not know how}} he would have, got on without him. On one trip he drove him 100 miles and helped him to get some very valuable mineral specimens. Mr. Walsh also assisted him in obtaining valuable ethnological collections. The gentlemen were unanimously elected. MEMORIAL TO BARON VON MULLER, The Secretary (Mr. Alex. Morton) said that during his recent visit to Melbourne he had met Professor W. Baldwin Spencer, M. A., Professor of Biology of the Melbourne University, who had informed him that the United Scientific Societies of Australasia had agreed to unite in obtaining sufficient funds for the purpose of establishing some tangible form of perpetuating the memory of the illustrious deceased Baron Von Mueller.
