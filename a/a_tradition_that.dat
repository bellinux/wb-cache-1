5|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> Ine was a saint, {{and was the}} dedicatee of St Ina's Church in Llanina near New Quay, Wales. However, a {{more likely}} dedicatee for this church is the fifth-century Welsh Saint Ina.|$|E
5|$|Indo-Caribbean {{people in}} the Lesser Antillean music area are {{clustered}} in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the chowtal songs from the springtime festival phagwa, and Hindi bhajans which are still sung at temples despite there being few people who understand Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that {{was referred to as}} local music.|$|E
5|$|Peter was {{the first}} late Roman/Byzantine author to write on {{imperial}} ceremonies, beginning <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> lasted unto the 14th century. His histories are also an important historical source; for instance, his work alone preserves the negotiations and provisions of the Roman–Persian treaty of 298 between Galerius and Narseh.|$|E

5|$|Pilgrims {{attempt to}} visit the {{confines}} of the area, for there is <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected. Access into the area is not always possible, especially during the Hajj season, as the space can only accommodate a few hundred people.|$|E
5|$|The main {{innovation}} of {{the pyramid}} of Unas is the first appearance of the Pyramid Texts, {{one of the oldest}} religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day. In doing so, Unas initiated <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} events {{have been held}} at the CAB, as well as {{receiving}} distinguished visitors. As part of the festivities for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Olympic torch was passed through the hands {{of members of the}} First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles {{on the steps of the}} CAB.

5|$|Despite the setback, {{the team}} {{returned}} to the Eastern Conference Finals during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and defeated the Philadelphia Flyers four games to two. They swept the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> lives on with each Cup winner. Claude Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP. The success came amid constant rumors that the team would move {{for the third time}} in its history to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across {{the majority of the}} page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> started with the Book of Durrow.|$|E

5|$|R.H. Brandling of Middleton Lodge gave land on Town Street {{on which}} to build a church and parsonage in 1845. St Mary's Church was built in 1846 to designs by R. D. Chantrell, who also {{designed}} Leeds Parish Church. The church and its lych gate are designated Grade II listed buildings. The church originally had a tall spire which was taken down because of mining subsidence in 1939. There is <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> local miners gave either a week's wages or a week's work towards the cost of its construction.|$|E
5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} Wheel of the Year, <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E
5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on Puffin Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) {{half a mile from}} the coast {{at the same time as}} he founded the monastery. There is a tower of a 12th-century church on Puffin Island still. There is <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> St. Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E
5|$|The Queen comforted {{herself by}} rigidly {{continuing}} with Prince Albert's plans for their children. Princess Alice {{was married to}} Prince Louis, the future Grand Duke of Hesse, at Osborne on 1 June 1862. In 1863, Edward, the Prince of Wales, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark. The Queen made it <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> the eldest unmarried daughter would become her unofficial secretary, a position which Louise filled in 1866, despite the Queen's concern that she was indiscreet.|$|E
5|$|The Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay {{alliance}} {{treated the}} territories of Palestine and, at times, Transjordan, as hereditary fiefdoms. During troublesome periods, the three families would unite their forces to confront challenges from rebels or local rivals. The military relationship between them originated with {{the protection of}} the annual hajj caravan. When a particular governor was assigned the role of amir al-hajj, it would require him to depart from his sanjak for extended time periods. In order to protect their districts from Bedouin raids, tax evasion and personal property damage, departing governors normally entrusted their authority with the rulers of the neighboring sanjak. For example, in 1589, Ridwan Pasha requested Assaf ibn Turabay to temporarily replace him as governor of Damascus, beginning <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> lasted well into the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Fairbanks also grew during this time. The Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra {{was founded in}} 1959, and the Fairbanks Drama Association was created in 1963. The Alaska Goldpanners {{baseball}} team was founded in 1959 as the city's first professional sports team. The next year, the Goldpanners hosted their first annual Midnight Sun Baseball Game, <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> had been conducted since 1905 and continues under the Goldpanners' auspices today. Through the 1960s, Fairbanks became much more like small towns in the Lower 48 as communications, transportation, and utilities improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It {{disappeared}} from its mainland range {{at the end}} of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat, hunting by humans, or a combination of the two. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> continues today. It has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means, but none of these are yet feasible.|$|E
5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. <b>A</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>that</b> Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E
