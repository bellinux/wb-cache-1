5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E

30|$|<b>A</b> new <b>cognitive</b> {{transmission}} technique for MIMO uplink channels has been proposed.

We have shown that a conventional WPA provides <b>an</b> efficient <b>cognitive</b> performance for intermediate SNRs but results in <b>a</b> zero <b>cognitive</b> data rate for high SNRs. A modified WPA that allows the primary node to release some eigenmodes without affecting its required QoS and ensures <b>a</b> positive <b>cognitive</b> data rate for all the cases has been also investigated.|$|R
40|$|Depressive {{symptoms}} tend {{to increase}} in adolescence, and {{have been associated with}} the development of <b>a</b> negative <b>cognitive</b> style. Cognitive theories postulate that <b>a</b> negative <b>cognitive</b> style precedes the development of depressive symptoms while other theories suggest <b>a</b> negative <b>cognitive</b> style is <b>a</b> consequence. We examined the reciprocal relationship between <b>a</b> negative <b>cognitive</b> style and depressive symptoms over three measurements in a community sample of 720 adolescents (11 - 15 years; 52. 8 % male). Additionally, we examined the moderating effects of gender. An increased negative cognitive style predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms, but not vice versa. These patterns were found consistently and were not moderated by gender. The findings suggest that <b>a</b> pre-existing negative <b>cognitive</b> style influences the development of depressive symptoms, while <b>a</b> negative <b>cognitive</b> style develops independent of baseline levels of depressive symptoms. These effects do not differ between boys and girls. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R
5|$|People {{who engage}} in {{intellectual}} activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This {{is compatible with the}} cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. Education delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E
