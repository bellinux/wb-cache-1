40|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for {{aircraft}} Halon 1301 bottles has been developed, a prototype <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> system constructed, and over 200 used bottles tested at the repair facilities {{of the two}} manufacturers of these bottles. The system monitors a bottle with six acoustic sensors while {{the pressure of the}} bottle is raised by heating it in an oven. The sensors are held in position, with a fixed relationship between them, by a special fixture. This fixture is designed to fit spheres with diameters between 5 and 16 inches. Results of the tests on used bottles indicate that over 95 percent of the bottles showed no indication of significant defects. The rest had some indication of flaws or corrosion. However, all bottles tested to date have passed the hydrostatic test required by the U. S. Department of Transportation. Based upon this data, the Air Transport Association (ATA) requested an exemption from the DOT to allow their members to use this <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> in place [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Switchgear {{is often}} {{inspected}} using thermal imaging {{to assess the}} state of the system and predict failures before they occur. Other methods include partial discharge (PD) testing, using either fixed or portable testers, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> using surface-mounted transducers (for oil equipment) or ultrasonic detectors used in outdoor switchyards. Temperature sensors fitted to cables to the switchgear can permanently monitor temperature build-up. SF6 equipment is invariably fitted with alarms and interlocks to warn of loss of pressure, and to prevent operation if the pressure falls too low.|$|E
50|$|Non-destructive {{examination}} (NDE) or {{nondestructive testing}} (NDT) {{is a family}} of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic-particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, eddy-current testing, <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher. Stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{emission}} uses {{much lower}} frequencies than traditional ultrasonic testing, and the sensor is typically expected to detect active flaws at distances {{up to several}} meters. A large fraction of the structures customarily testing with acoustic emission are fabricated from steel plate - tanks, pressure vessels, pipes and so on. Lamb wave theory is therefore the prime theory for explaining the signal forms and propagation velocities that are observed when conducting <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing.</b> Substantial improvements in the accuracy of AE source location (a major techniques of AE testing) can be achieved through good understanding and skillful utilization of the Lamb wave body of knowledge.|$|E
40|$|Acoustics plays a {{vital role}} in {{maintaining}} the health, safety, and comfort of crew members aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In order to maintain this livable and workable environment, acoustic requirements have been established to ensure that ISS hardware and payload developers account for the <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions</b> of their equipment and develop acoustic mitigations as necessary. These requirements are verified by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> of the integrated hardware. The Amine Swingbed ExPRESS (Expedite the PRocessing of ExperimentS to Space) rack payload creates a unique challenge to the developers in that the payload hardware is transported to the ISS in phases, making an <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> on the integrated flight hardware impossible. In addition, the payload incorporates a high back pressure fan and a diaphragm vacuum pump, which are recognized as significant and complex noise sources. In order to accurately predict the <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions</b> of the integrated payload, the individual acoustic noise sources and paths are first characterized. These characterizations are conducted though a series of <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>tests</b> on the individual payload components. Secondly, the individual acoustic noise sources and paths are incorporated into a virtual model of the integrated hardware. The virtual model is constructed with the use of hybrid method utilizing the Finite Element Acoustic (FEA) and Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) techniques, which predict the overall <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions.</b> Finally, the <b>acoustic</b> model is validated though an acoustic characterization test performed on an acoustically similar mock-up of the flight unit. The results of the validated acoustic model are then used to assess the <b>acoustic</b> <b>emissions</b> of the flight unit and define further acoustic mitigation efforts...|$|R
40|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for {{aircraft}} Halon bottles {{has been developed}} {{in response to a}} need expressed by the US Airline Industry. During this development many choices had to be made about test methods, procedures and analysis techniques. This paper discusses these choices and how successful they were. The test itself was designed to replace the currently required hydrostatic test for these bottles. The necessary load is applied by heating the sealed bottles. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> is monitored, during the heating, by six sensors held in position by a special fixture. A prototype of the test apparatus was constructed and used in two commercial Halon bottle repair and test facilities. Results to date indicate that about 97 % of the bottles tested show no indications of flaws. The other 3 % have had indications of possible flaws in non-critical areas of the bottles.

50|$|An {{arbitrary}} mechanical excitation {{applied to}} a plate will generate a multiplicity of Lamb waves carrying energy {{across a range of}} frequencies. Such is the case for the acoustic emission wave. In <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> the challenge is to recognize the multiple Lamb wave components in the received waveform and to interpret them in terms of source motion. This contrasts with the situation in ultrasonic testing, where the first challenge is to generate a single, well-controlled Lamb wave mode at a single frequency. But even in ultrasonic testing, mode conversion takes place when the generated Lamb wave interacts with flaws, so the interpretation of reflected signals compounded from multiple modes becomes a means of flaw characterization.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the abilities of <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> and self-sensing fibres to detect damage in composite materials. This was achieved by performing <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> on fibre samples and resin samples during tensile tests. In parallel to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> the changes in strain for the resin samples was recorded using electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> of Self-sensing fibre composites allowed the recorded changes in the light intensity transmitted by the fibres to be analysed in conjunction with the acoustic emission data. The fabrication of the three different sample types is presented as is the installation of the electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. The experimental procedure and method of data capture is detailed for tensile and <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> strain data and Self-sensing fibre data.

40|$|Keywords:in-situ stress, <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission,</b> rock mechanics, stress {{measurement}} Abstract. The CSIRO overcoring stress relief and hydraulic fracturing methods {{are the most}} popular methods used for the measurement of in-situ stress at depth. One major advantage of the CSIRO overcoring stress relief method is that the three dimensional state of stress can be obtained, but the measurement must be done in an excavated tunnel [1]. Hydraulic fracturing method can be carried out on the ground surface, but it assumed that one of the principal stresses direction is vertical [2, 3]. In terms of the disadvantages of the two methods, the techniques based on core orientation and <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> behavior of rocks are incorporated in the in-situ {{stress measurement}} in order to obtain the in-situ stress conditions at depth in Shuichang Iron Mine. According to the comparison of the measurement data obtained from the <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> in the laboratory and CSIRO overcoring stress relief measurement in the field, effectiveness of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> is confirmed. In addition, the relationships between in-situ stresses and tectonic settings are analyzed.

40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> is an {{important}} technology for evaluating structural materials, and especially for detecting damage in structural members. Significant new capabilities may be gained by developing MEMS transducers for <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> including permanent bonding or embedment for superior coupling, greater density of transducer placement, and a bundle of transducers on each device tuned to different frequencies.
