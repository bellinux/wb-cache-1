5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that had been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E

The appropriate question is solidarity for what? The short answer is for building a peaceful and developmental region where poverty eradication is the main objective. Thus, this becomes an ideological construct. Second of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to do the inventory of what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> as natural and social assets, and as skills.

It should include human security, which means the protection of social, political and economic rights, the protection of the eco-systems, and formulation and implementation of policies intended for the elimination of poverty.|$|R

5|$|Unchained {{includes}} {{all the characters}} from the GameCube version, and four more characters — Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana — from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance that are exclusive to the PlayStation Portable version. The four characters have only one Fatality and no Hara-kiri in contrast to other characters, most likely because that was <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> in Deadly Alliance. Exclusive to the Unchained version is the Endurance mode, where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents. The system's wireless ad hoc network functionality {{can be used for}} multiplayer games. Characters who remain hidden in the other versions appear unlocked by default in Unchained; producer Shaun Himmerick explained that the staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in Deception, such as Liu Kang. Although Midway did not develop the game, they helped Just Games Interactives optimize their code and the Wi-Fi feature, as they wanted to keep the frame rate very high. Metacritic gave it an average of 70 from 14 reviews. Jeff Haynes from IGN mentioned problems with the controls and criticized the long loading times.|$|E
5|$|With {{the series}} already lost, the England {{selectors}} {{continued to make}} many changes, on this occasion, four. In <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> used 21 players for the series and were severely criticised for failing to maintain continuity. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss, and elected to bat on a pitch affected by rain. After a delayed start due to inclement weather, the Australian pace attack, led by Ray Lindwall, dismissed England within the first day for just 52. Lindwall was the main destroyer, taking six wickets for 20 runs (6/20). The English batsmen {{found it difficult to}} cope with his prodigious swing and pace; four of his wickets were either bowled or leg before wicket. Len Hutton was the only batsman to resist, making 30 before being the final man dismissed. In reply, Australia's opening pair of Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes passed England's score on the same afternoon with no loss of wickets. The opening stand ended at 117 when Barnes fell for 61 and Bradman came to the crease to a standing ovation and three cheers from his opponents. He fell second ball, but Australia reached 153/2 at stumps on the first day.|$|E

Adding to this anxiety, the deserters who {{came back to the}} fort declared that the Asturian sailor, ignorant of military operations, would never return alive.|$|E

Indeed, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and Democratic, was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.|$|E
25|$|Yuan Shao, using a {{great deal}} less than his main strength, {{attacked}} Yu Jin's position at Yan Ford in a probing action. Yu Jin held his ground firmly and Yuan Shao could not take him, thus {{the possibility of a}} rear attack of Xu City was thrashed. To follow up, Yu Jin joined up with Yue Jin and raided Yuan Shao's detached encampments along the Yellow River southwest from Yan Ford with 5,000 infantry and cavalry. They raided up as far as Ji (汲; 25 li southwest of present-day Weihui, Henan), and crossed the river to raid Huojia (獲嘉; southeast of present-day Huojia, Henan) to the north. In <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> set fire to some 30 enemy camps, decapitated several thousand heads, captured several thousand men alive, and forced the surrender of some 20 generals including He Mao (何茂) and Wang Mo (王摩).|$|E
25|$|Yue Jin {{participated in}} the pivotal Battle of Guandu in 200 CE, in which Cao Cao pitted his forces against those of his rival, Yuan Shao. Before Cao Cao led the main army to the frontline, Yue Jin was {{assigned}} several thousand soldiers to reinforce Yu Jin at Yan Ford (延津; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan). After rendezvousing with Yu Jin, they selected 5,000 elite soldiers composed of infantry and cavalry, and raided Yuan Shao's detached encampments along the Yellow River southwest from Yan fortress. They snaked up as far as Ji (汲; 25 li southwest of present-day Weihui, Henan), and crossed the river to raid Huojia (獲嘉; southeast of present-day Huojia, Henan) to the north. In <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> set fire to some 30 enemy camps, killed thousands of enemies, captured several thousand men alive, and forced the surrender of some 20 officers, including He Mao (何茂) and Wang Mo (王摩).|$|E

25|$|At Ava, Hsinbyushin {{was furious}} that his generals had acted without his knowledge, and tore up his {{copy of the}} treaty. Knowing that the king was angry, the Burmese armies were afraid {{to return to the}} capital. In January 1770, they marched to Manipur where a {{rebellion}} had begun, taking advantage of Burmese troubles with the Chinese. After a three days' battle near Langthabal, the Meiteis were defeated, and their raja fled to Assam. The Burmese raised their nominee to the throne, and returned. The king's anger had subsided; after <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> won victories and preserved his throne. Still, the king sent Maha Thiha Thura, the decorated general, whose daughter was married to Hsinbyushin's son and heir-apparent Singu, a woman's dress to wear, and exiled him and other generals to the Shan states. He would not allow them to see him. He also exiled ministers who dared to speak on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|In July 1762, barely {{six months}} after {{becoming}} emperor, Peter took a holiday with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, leaving his wife in Saint Petersburg. On the night of 8 July (OS: 27 June 1762), Catherine the Great was given the news {{that one of her}} co-conspirators had been arrested by her estranged husband, and that <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been planning must take place at once. She left the palace and departed for the Ismailovsky regiment, where she delivered a speech asking the soldiers to protect her from her husband. Catherine then left with the regiment to go to the Semenovsky Barracks, where the clergy were waiting to ordain her as the sole occupant of the Russian throne. She had her husband arrested, and forced him to sign a document of abdication, leaving no one to dispute her accession to the throne. On 17 July 1762—eight days after the coup and just {{six months after}} his accession to the throne—Peter III died at Ropsha, at the hands of Alexei Orlov (younger brother to Grigory Orlov, then a court favourite and a participant in the coup). Historians find no evidence for Catherine's complicity in the supposed assassination.|$|E

500|$|Constantine began a major {{expansion}} of Trier. He strengthened the circuit wall {{around the city}} with military towers and fortified gates, and began building a palace complex in the northeastern part of the city. To the south of his palace, he ordered {{the construction of a}} large formal audience hall, and a massive imperial bathhouse. Constantine sponsored many building projects across Gaul during his tenure as emperor of the West, especially in Augustodunum (Autun) and Arelate (Arles). According to Lactantius, Constantine followed his father in following a tolerant policy towards Christianity. Although not yet a Christian, he probably judged it a more sensible policy than open persecution, and a way to distinguish himself from the [...] "great persecutor", Galerius. Constantine decreed a formal end to persecution, and returned to Christians <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lost during the persecutions.|$|E
500|$|Having {{already been}} engaged in close combat with {{the rear of the}} Crusader column, {{the right wing of the}} Ayyubid army was in compact {{formation}} and too close to their enemy to avoid the full impact of the charge. Indeed, some of the cavalry of this wing had dismounted in order to fire their bows more effectively. As a result, they suffered great numbers of casualties, the knights taking a bloody revenge for <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> had to endure earlier in the battle. Baha al-Din noted that [...] "the rout was complete." [...] He had been in the centre division of Saladin's army, when it turned in flight he looked to join the left wing, but found that it also was in rapid flight. Noting the disintegration of the right wing he finally sought Saladin's personal banners, but found only seventeen members of the bodyguard and a lone drummer still with them.|$|E

The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) as he stands on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, [...] "Lest We Forget" [...] in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.|$|E

500|$|Compared to the {{graphical}} changes, {{the artificial}} intelligence (AI) of the computer-controlled characters {{was only slightly}} changed. The justification given was that the team felt the AI worked very well for the first game. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{to do was to}} tweak it a little and fix some bugs. There was, however, a lot of work done in improving the multiplayer portion of the game. For FreeSpace 2, the player's personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting the possible consequences for other players' actions. This reduced the amount of data needed to be transferred between the computers, which would result in a smoother playing experience. Beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot the multiplayer mode as well. SquadWar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among the players {{in the form of a}} persistent online territorial fight, along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings. Volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong, online community and build up the game's lifespan. The process of fixing the bugs detected was even publicly published on the game's official website as the [...] "Bug Fix of the Day" [...] feature.|$|E

[...] The writers were able to use the music, as one of the women who worked at Nickelodeon at the time [...] "knew somebody somewhere who had access to something," [...] and she brought in a copy of the song on CD.

500|$|When the consul {{reported}} {{that what he}} had bought was almost worthless, the ship's insurers began a thorough investigation, which soon revealed {{the truth of the}} over-insured cargo. In July 1885, Parker and the shippers were tried in Boston for conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Parker was additionally charged with [...] "wilfully cast away the ship," [...] a crime known as barratry and at the time carrying the death penalty. The conspiracy case was heard first, but on August 15, the jury announced that they could not agree on a verdict. Some jurors were unwilling to risk prejudicing Parker's forthcoming capital trial by finding him guilty on the conspiracy charge. Rather than ordering an expensive retrial, the judge negotiated an arrangement whereby the defendants withdrew their insurance claims and repaid <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> received. The barratry charge against Parker was deferred, and he was allowed to go free. Nevertheless, his professional reputation was ruined, and he died in poverty three months later. One of his co-defendants went mad, and another committed suicide. Begg observes that [...] "if the court of man could not punish these men... the curse that had devilled the ship since her first skipper Robert McLellan had died on her maiden voyage could reach beyond the vessel's watery grave and exact its own terrible retribution." ...|$|E
