Keywords: Effectiveness, Song Lyrics, <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Speech</b> 	The use <b>of</b> {{song lyrics}} as {{material}} {{in the classroom is}} very nice activity. It can be something attractive for the students. They can learn the material through the lyrics of song and sing the lyrics of song. It makes the students’ emotion to be good. So, they can enthusiastic and motivated to learn English material (<b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech).</b> But in the fact, the students still feel difficult in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> Furthermore, the researcher tries to help the students’ ability in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by learning the lyrics of song as the {{material in the}} classroom. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before being taught by using song lyrics? 2) How is the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> after being taught by using song lyrics? 3) Is there any significant difference between the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before and after being taught by using song lyrics? The purpose of this research are: 1) To find out the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before being taught by using song lyrics. 2) To find out the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> after being taught by using song lyrics. 3) To find out the significant difference between the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before and after being taught by using song lyrics. Research Method: 1) The research design in this study was pre-experimental design in the form of One-Group Pretest-Posttest designs with quantitative approach, 2) The population of this research is all students of eight grade at SMPN 1 Sumbergempol Tulungagung, 3) The sample was VIII B class consisting of 32 students, 4) The research instrument was test (pre-test and post-test), 5) The data analysis was using paired sample T- test by using SPSS 16. 0 for windows.

40|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> {{are called}} the most important, from a {{particular}} point of view, word classes. In the European tradition <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> have been recovered by ancient grammarians, their classification reflect the essential properties of the Greek and Latin languages and, presumably, were based on psycholinguistic representations of the speakers of these languages, in which the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> have maximum expressiveness in morphology, syntax and lexis. <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> were distinguished primarily on morphological characteristics, sometimes based on syntactic and semantic features.

In other traditions, as well, there were comparable with European basic <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> units <b>of</b> classes, but there could be certain differences. The traditional notion <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> may have a different value depending on the structure of the language.

The human memory words as you can assume, are stored in the form of some groups that have common properties. Stored in the memory word groups can not be completely common in their properties, but for various languages typical is the use of some obvious properties, allowing them to be identified.
