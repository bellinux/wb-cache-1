The classical models are still used to interpret data from natural populations.

Eight generations of three crosses involved three parental lines were evaluated for disease incidence (percentage of infected plants) and disease severity under natural occurrence of PBNV infection in a randomized complete block design with six replications. Evaluations were carried out at 30, 40, 50 and 60 Days After Planting (DAP). The analysis followed Hayman’s model and Gamble’s notations were used to describe parameters of gene effects. Joint scaling test was used to determine adequacy of the model. <b>Additive</b> <b>gene</b> effect was the most important contribution to genetic variation in generation means for both disease incidence and disease severity in the cross ICGV 86388 x IC 10.

This number was the highest in the silage maize inbred lines ZPLB 402, ZPLB 403 and ZPLB 405 in both years of investigation, resulting in low both positive and negative values of heterosis. The correct estimation of combining abilities is necessary in order to develop superior hybrids. This estimation was done on the basis of diallel hybrids after the method of Griffing (1956; method II, model I). The analysis of variance for combining abilities for the number of kernel rows per ear points to the significance of general and special combining abilities. The GCA to SCA ratio indicates that <b>additive</b> <b>genes</b> and the additive variance have a significant role in inheritance of this trait. Highly significant values of GCA for the number of kernel rows per ear for both years were found in the silage maize inbred lines ZPLB 402 and ZPLB 403, whereas inbreds ZPLB 401, ZPLB 404 and ZPLB 406 had negative values.
