5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to <b>applied</b> <b>research,</b> which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E

5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier of {{technological}} education institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark {{for the first time}} in its history. Thomas E. Stelson was Georgia Tech's Vice President for Research from 1974 to 1988. Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of basic research versus <b>applied</b> <b>research,</b> Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on research activities allowed more funding for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise from that of the 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
