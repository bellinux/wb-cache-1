50|$|The first {{successful}} penis <b>allotransplant</b> surgery {{was done in}} September 2005 in a military hospital in Guangzhou, China. A man at 44 sustained an injury after an accident and his penis was severed; urination became difficult as his urethra was partly blocked. A recently brain-dead man, aged 23, was selected for the transplant. Despite atrophy of blood vessels and nerves, the arteries, veins, nerves and the corpora spongiosa were successfully matched. But, on 19 September (after two weeks), the surgery was reversed because of a severe psychological problem (rejection) by the recipient and his wife.|$|E
50|$|Rainer W.G. Gruessner (born 1957) is an American {{general surgeon}} and {{transplant}} surgeon of German descent, most noted as a surgical pioneer for his clinical and research innovations.Gruessner {{was the first}} transplant surgeon to perform all types of abdominal transplants (kidney, liver, pancreas and intestine) from living donors. He {{was also the first}} surgeon to describe a standardized technique for intestinal (bowel) transplantation from a living donor and then perform it successfully in 1997. He was the first surgeon to perform a combined laparoscopic removal of a portion of the pancreas and a kidney that were successfully transplanted simultaneously into a diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease. In 1998, Gruessner performed the first preemptive liver transplant from a living donor in an infant with oxalosis. In 2012, he and his team performed the first fully robotic removal of the pancreas and simultaneous islet transplant in a patient with chronic pancreatitis.Gruessner was part of the teams that performed the world’s first split pancreas transplant and the world's first pancreas <b>allotransplant</b> after complete removal of a patient's native pancreas (both in 1988). He was involved in the development of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) techniques and conducted the first prospective study in 1989 that showed the superiority of ultrasound in comparison to peritoneal lavage in the diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma. In the 1990s, {{he was the first to}} confirm in large clinical studies the efficacy of new immunosuppressive drugs after pancreas transplantation. Gruessner’s basic-science research has focused on different techniques of donor cell augmentation for tolerance induction after transplantation and on different rejection patterns in single versus combined transplants. In 2015, he and his team showed that 25 years of organ transplantation in the U.S. saved 2.2 million years of life in patients with end-stage organ failure.|$|E

40|$|Within a {{few hours}} of {{transplantation}} the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system migrate into the interstitial tissues of the organ. The cells arrive on the vascular endothelium of the allotransplanted organ either as macrophages or as monocytes but on entering the interstitial tissues they begin to enlarge, differentiate and undergo active pinocytosis. Along with the cell migration, which would appear to be their stimulus to migrate, is an extravasation of the protein-rich plasma. Erythrocytes also pass into the interstitium and, if effete, are contracted by monocyte-macrophages and phagocytosed in the classical manner. All through the natural history of an <b>allotransplant</b> new monocyte-macrophage recruits arrive the interstitial tissues of the <b>allotransplant.</b> Some of these cells escape via the lymphatics but the vast majority accumulate in the <b>allotransplant,</b> interdigitate and fuse with one another but make no attempt to damage the tissues into which they have migrated.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress the immune response is not well defined. A recent study has shown that β-catenin prolongs Treg cell survival. Because β-catenin is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK- 3 β) -directed phosphorylation, we focused on GSK- 3 β and the role it plays in Treg cell function. Inhibition of GSK- 3 β led to increased suppression activity by Treg cells. Inhibitor-treated Treg cells exhibited prolonged FoxP 3 expression and increased levels of β-catenin and of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Systemic administration of GSK- 3 β inhibitor resulted in prolonged islet survival in an <b>allotransplant</b> mouse model.

40|$|Background—Recent {{studies in}} mice and {{patients}} suggest that posttransplantation induction of autoimmune responses to tissue-specific antigens {{contributes to the}} rejection of major histocompatibility complex mismatched <b>allotransplants.</b> The relevance of this phenomenon to the rejection of major and minor histocompatibility-mismatched allografts performed in large-animal models remains to be established. Methods—Miniature swine were immunized with cardiac myosin (CM) in Freund’s adjuvant and received heterotopic, minor antigen-mismatched heart transplants. T-cell (proliferation and delayed type hypersensitivity [DTH]) and B-cell (antibody) responses specific to CM were measured. The rejection of heart transplants was assessed histologically. Results—Three of four swine that were immunized with CM before receiving a minor antigen-mismatched heart transplant exhibited potent DTH, T-cell proliferation and antibody responses to CM and rejected their grafts acutely. The fourth swine, which failed to mount a significant DTH response to CM and displayed low and transient anti-CM antibody titers, demonstrated long-term allograft survival.

Fifty-five New Zealand White nonconsanguineous rabbits were used and allocated into five experimental groups: Each group comprised donors submitted to right salpingo-oophorectomy that served as the donated allograft. In group I no cyclosporin (CsA) was administered and rabbits were submitted to left salpingo-oophorectomy (LSO). Group 2 was the <b>allotransplant</b> group and did not receive CsA. Group 3 was the <b>allotransplant</b> group with CsA. They were submitted to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by OT-OA. CsA of 10 mg/kg/day was administered to rabbits for the first 21 days and 5 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the study. Group 4 received CsA just as for group 3 and was submitted to LSO. During the study the following were measured: estradiol (E 2), progesterone (P 4), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and histopathological study of the uteri, tubes, and ovaries. Groups 1, 3, and 4 showed a significant increase in serum E 2 and P 4 levels corresponding to the second week of gestation, compared to group 2 (p <. 05).

Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the incidence and outcome of BSIs in a cohort of patients submitted to allo-SCT, in order to track changes of the epidemiology and bacteria resistance. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the microbiological data of 162 patients <b>allotransplanted</b> in Brescia University Hospital, over a period of 6 years. Results: Eighty patients experienced a BSIs for a total of 119 isolates. In 77 cases (65 %) a Gram positive bacteria was isolated, being coagulase negative Staphilococci the most frequent species (77 % of the cases). In 42 cases (35 %) a Gram negative bacteria was isolated (E. coli 57 % and P. aeruginosa 24 %). Fluoroquinolones resistance was frequent (90 % for S. epidermidis, 92 % for E. coli, 90 % for P. aeruginosa). Methycillin resistance of S. epidermidis was 100 %, 76 % of E. coli were ESBL positive and among P. aeruginosa resistance to carbapenems was 40 %. The 2 years overall survival of patients with BSIs vs patients without BSIs was 46 % vs 60 % (HR 1, 48, p= 0, 07).

Settings and Design: A retrospective chart review was conducted by querying the intraoperative electronic medical record system of a 1200 -bed tertiary academic hospital over a 5 months period, and reviewing anesthetic techniques, as well as postoperative morphine equivalent consumption. Materials and Methods: Fifty renal <b>allotransplant</b> recipients were identified, 13 of whom received TAP blocks while 37 received no regional analgesic technique. All blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance, with 20 mL of 0. 25 % bupivacaine injected in the transversus abdominis fascial plane under direct visualization. The primary outcome was postoperative morphine equivalent consumption. Statistical Analysis Used: Morphine consumption was compared with the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test. Continuous variables of patient baseline characteristics were analyzed with unpaired t-test and categorical variables with Fischer Exact Test. A P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A statistically significant decrease in cumulative morphine consumption was found in the group that received the TAP block at 6 h (2. 46 mg vs. 7. 27 mg, P = 0. 0010), 12 h (3. 88 mg vs. 10. 20 mg, P = 0. 0005), 24 h (6. 96 mg vs. 14. 75 mg, P = 0. 0013), and 48 h (11 mg vs. 20. 13 mg, P = 0. 0092).

We studied the impact of minimal residual disease (MRD) - and graft-vs. -host disease (GvHD) -guided multiple consolidation chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) to prevent second relapse in patients with acute leukemia relapsing post-transplant and who achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy and DLI. Methods Forty-seven subjects with acute leukemia relapsing after an <b>allotransplant</b> and who achieved complete remission after post-relapse induction chemotherapy and DLI were eligible. The use of consolidation chemotherapy and DLI was guided by the results of MRD testing and whether or not DLI caused acute and/or chronic GvHD. Outcomes were compared with those of 34 similar historical controls who did not receive consolidation chemotherapy and DLIs after induction chemotherapy and DLI. Results One-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 22  % 95  % confidence interval (10, 35  %) vs. 56  % (39, 73  %); P[*]<[*] 0. 0001), leukemia-free survival (LFS; 71  % (57, 84  %) vs. 35  % (19, 51  %); P[*]<[*] 0. 0001), and survival (78  % (66, 90  %) vs. 44  % (27, 61  %); P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) was significantly better in subjects than controls. In multivariate analyses, no chronic GvHD after therapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 3. 56 (1. 09, 11. 58); P[*]=[*] 0. 035) and a positive MRD test after therapy (HR[*]=[*] 21. 04 (4. 44, 94. 87); P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) were associated with an increased CIR.

40|$|The {{application}} of composite tissue techniques is {{constrained by the}} susceptibility of skin to rejection. The aim of this thesis is to improve our understanding of skin rejection {{and find ways to}} avoid it, in order to enable expansion of the {{application of}} composite tissue transplantation techniques. The first part of the thesis explores the consequences and mechanism of skin rejection in rat models. These studies indicate that in the event of allograft failure, there is minimal damage to the vascular pedicle of a composite tissue <b>allotransplant,</b> even after full rejection, making retransplantation possible. Furthermore, there is only mild damage to the recipient tissues, indicating that the second transplant would not be limited in form or function by recipient tissue bed damage. Finally, the studies indicate that there are significant differences between the mechanism of rejection of skin in composite tissue transplants and conventional skin grafts. This means that much of the historical data relating to skin graft rejection is not necessarily relevant to composite tissue allotransplantation. The second part of the thesis uses swine models to explore ways to overcome skin rejection while avoiding the toxicity of chronic systemic immunosuppression, through tolerance induction, and site specific therapy. Previous experience in organ and composite tissue allotransplantation models are analysed to develop the hypothesis that high-level chimeras are tolerant to vascularised skin allotransplants. In utero and adult chimerism induction models are then used in an attempt to attain moderate-level chimeras. A vascularised skin <b>allotransplant</b> model is developed. Finally, the hypothesis is confirmed with the transplantation of a vascularised skin <b>allotransplant</b> on to moderate-level chimeras with the achievement of tolerance. In addition, site-specific therapy is used in an attempt to avoid the side-effects of chronic high-dose systemic immunosuppression. This led to prolongation of skin survival, but eventual skin rejection. ...|$|E

This {{study is}} {{provided}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of the treatment of kidney transplant recipients by predicting the development of the late <b>allotransplant</b> dysfunction. Methods. 330 patients who have lived for more than one year with functioning kidney allograft were evaluated. To predict the subsequent duration of the well-functioning of <b>allotransplant</b> the prognostic significance of 15 baseline clinical and sociodemographic characteristics on the results of the survey one year after transplantation was investigated. The result was considered to be positive in constructing the regression prognostication model if recipient lived more than 3 years from the time of transplantation. Results.

Specifically, the focus has shifted away from attempts at eradicating under-lying diseases through toxic high-dose chemo-radiation therapy towards using the stem cell donor’s immune cells for that purpose (allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect). The non-myeloablative transplant approaches hold promise in reducing the morbidity and mortal-ity associated with conventional high-dose chemoradiation therapy, and they allow allogeneic transplants in elderly or medically infirm patients who are at present not candidates for transplanta...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coping {{with the}} immune {{rejection}} of <b>allotransplants</b> or autologous cells {{in patients with}} an active sensitization towards their autoantigens and autoimmunity presently necessitates life-long immune suppressive therapy acting on the immune system as a whole, which makes the patients vulnerable to infections and increases their risk of developing cancer. New technologies to induce antigen selective long-lasting immunosuppression or immune tolerance are therefore much needed. Methodology/Principal Findings: The DNA demethylating agent Zebularine, previously demonstrated to induce expression of the genes for the immunosuppressive enzymes indolamine- 2, 3 -deoxygenase- 1 (IDO 1) and kynureninase of the kynurenine pathway, is tested for capacity to suppress rejection of <b>allotransplants.</b> Allogeneic pancreatic islets from Lewis rats were transplanted under the kidney capsule of Fischer rats previously made diabetic by a streptozotocin injection (40 mg/kg). One group was treated with Zebularine (225 mg/kg) daily for 14 days from day 6 or 8 after transplantation, and a control group received no further treatment. Survival of the transplants was monitored by blood sugar measurements. Rats, normoglycemic for 90 days after allografting, were subjected to transplant removal by nephrectomy to confirm whether normoglycemia was indeed due to a surviving insulin producing transplant, or alternatively {{was a result of}} recovery of pancreatic insulin production in some toxin-treated rats. Of 9 Zebularine treated rats, 4 were still normoglycemic after 9...|$|R
50|$|Follicular DCs develop from {{putative}} mesenchymal precursors. Severe {{combined immunodeficiency}} (SCID) mice models demonstrate that these precursors may be transmitted to recipients with bone marrow <b>allotransplants,</b> {{in which case}} both donors' and recipients' FDCs networks may later be found in recipients' lymphoid compartments. Interaction between FDCs precursors and lymphoid cells mediated by TNF-a and lymphotoxin (LT) is crucial for normal FDC development and maintenance. TNF-a binds on the TNFRI receptor, while LT interacts with LTβ-receptor expressed on FDC precursors. In mice lacking B cells, or with blocked TNF-a and lymphotoxin (LT) production, cells with FDC phenotype are missing.|$|R
