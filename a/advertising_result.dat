40|$|The {{benefits}} of OJ <b>advertising</b> <b>result</b> from 1) increased gallon sales and 2) higher prices. Advertising {{was estimated to}} increase the delivered-in price by $. 083 per single strength equivalent (SSE) gallon in 2006 - 07. The with-advertising and without-advertising delivered-in prices were estimated at $ 1. 981 and $ 1. 898 per SSE gallon, respectively. With FDOC advertising focusing on the U. S. market, benefits due to advertising were estimated for the U. S market only. However, it should be recognized that to the extent world OJ prices increase by the same amount as the U. S. price increase ($. 083 per SSE gallon), not only U. S. imports of OJ, but also Brazil and other country exports of OJ to Europe and other destinations also benefit from the advertising-induced price increases. Agribusiness,...|$|E

40|$|Women {{are active}} travel consumers, yet travel {{advertising}} notoriously depicts women stereotypically. If consumers react negatively to these stereotypical portrayals in advertising, they may disregard the ad or brand and purchase a different travel product. The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine if consumers react differently to stereotypical versus non-stereotypical depictions of women in travel advertising. The study will examine these reactions, by measuring attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand, purchase intention, and cognitive responses to carefully prepared advertisements that are characterized as ―stereotypical‖ or ―non-stereotypical. ‖ Ads are defined as stereotypical by utilizing Goffman‘s (1979) framework for analyzing images of women in <b>advertising.</b> <b>Results</b> overwhelmingly indicate that consumers in this study display more favorable attitudes to the non-stereotypical depictions of women in travel advertising. Attitudes toward the advertising, brand, purchase intention, and cognitive responses were all significantly more favorable among the non-stereotypical <b>advertising</b> condition. The <b>results</b> have theoretical benefit to the travel advertising industry, since these findings support the affect transfer hypothesis and dual mediation hypothesis. No studies to date have examined such research in travel <b>advertising</b> and <b>results</b> indicate a possible need for action among advertisers...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the contribution of direct mail advertising to average weekly unit sales of a national fast food franchisee. Two different types of direct mail advertising are used, both independently and in conjunction with local and national <b>advertising.</b> <b>Results</b> of a field study indicate that one type of direct mail (a shopper) contributes significantly to sales when used independently. When combined with national or local advertising, however, the contribution level of this shopper decreases. Conversely, a direct mail insert combined with many others inserts into one single envelope is much more powerful when utilized in conjunction with national <b>advertising.</b> In fact, <b>results</b> show that this latter combination of direct mail with national advertising contributes more to average weekly unit sales than any other combination. Implications are offered and future research is suggested. ...|$|R

Method: 509 females (40 - 89 years) were surveyed on make-up use, reasons for following adverts for beauty products aimed at their age group, perceptions and impact of these, and preference for use of older models.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the role that}} reputation plays in assuring product quality in markets where consumers can only imperfectly judge product quality even after consumption. Three conclusions are derived. First, high quality firms have more customers because they have fewer dissatisfied customers who leave and word-of-mouth <b>advertising</b> <b>results</b> in more arrivals. Second, higher fixed costs {{can result in a}} higher equilibrium level of quality. Third, the particular form that word-of-mouth advertising takes can have significant effects on the market outcome. Recommendations consisting of a report of whether the consumer intends to patronize the same firm again generate an externality that is absent when actual estimates of quality are communicated. ...|$|R
5000|$|Setting {{advertising}} objectives {{provides the}} framework for the entire advertising plan.

Advertising objectives should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable and Time-dependent (SMART). [...] Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks - that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated. One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach (Defining Advertising Goals for Measured <b>Advertising</b> <b>Results)</b> developed in the 1960s. While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the competitive}} effects of informative advertising. The seminal work by Grossman and Shapiro (1984) show that informative <b>advertising</b> <b>results</b> in lower prices and that firms {{may benefit from}} advertising restrictions. A crucial assumption in their model is that captive (partially informed) consumers are not price responsive. Replicating their model in a Hotelling duopoly version, we show that results are in fact reversed if we allow for captive consumers to respond to prices. We then use general demand functions and derive exact conditions for the competitive effect to prevail. A main {{result is that the}} procompetitive effect depends on the nature of competition and the relative price elasticities of the monopoly and the competitive demand segments...|$|R
