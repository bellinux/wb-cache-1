5|$|Slade's Case (or Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English {{contract}} law that ran from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit,</b> which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> {{had several}} {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the plaintiff {{could count on}} always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe the plaintiff money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit,</b> which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>action</b> <b>of</b> indebitatus <b>assumpsit.</b> Following the {{recognition}} in Slade's Case (1602) that assumpsit {{could be brought}} in lieu of debt sur contract, a form <b>of</b> <b>action</b> known as indebitatus assumpsit took shape. This action developed several sub-forms known as the common money counts. These actions were initially used to enforce {{what we would call}} contractual liability, but they rested on the court implying that a defendant had promised to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff. This promise initially reflected reality, but came to be used fictitiously. Thus where A mistakenly paid money to B, the law would imply a promise by B that B would repay the money: A could then bring an action for money had and received and recover the mistaken payment. The defendant's obligation was not consensually undertaken, but imposed by law. From such actions came the law of quasi-contract This area of law is now known as the law of unjust enrichment.|$|R
40|$|In {{the law of}} {{contracts}} therd {{is a great deal}} of misunderstanding or lack of understanding in regard to certain topics connected with the subject of discharge. Some of this 2 ̆ 7 is due to the fact that few men use such terms as condition and warranty in the same 2 ̆ 7 sense. The rest is due to faulty reasoning concerning matters that are admittedly difficult. This article will not attemptto discuss the subject of discharge in all of its details, but will try to delimit the. field and will discuss at some length a few of the problems arising therein. In particular, the relations existing between the subject of fulfilment of conditions and the subject of discharge, and between breach of contract and discharge, will be discussed. It is believed that great assistance will be obtained from a clear understanding and a complete separation of primaryand secondary obligations. Like aid will be gained from the idea that the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> special <b>assumpsit</b> was an action for damages, was always the method of enforcing a secondary obligation, while the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> debt and indebitatus assumpsit were chiefly for the enforcement of primary obligations...|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{its long}} history, the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> {{has been used}} to enforce what are now {{referred}} to as obligations arising in tort, contract, and (in some common law jurisdictions) unjust enrichment. Most significantly, it is out of the law relating to the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> that the modern law of contract and of unjust enrichment emerged in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E
5000|$|By the 18th and 19th centuries, the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> {{was used}} to enforce both {{contractual}} and quasi-contractual claims. The recognition in Slade's Case that the law would import or imply a promise to pay the debt {{paved the way for}} other implications.|$|E
50|$|Assumpsit ("he has undertaken", from Latin, assumere), or more fully, the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit,</b> {{was a form}} {{of action}} at common law. The origins of the action {{can be traced to the}} 14th century, when litigants seeking justice in the royal courts turned from the writs of {{covenant}} and debt to the trespass on the case.|$|E
2500|$|Contract law {{is based}} on the {{principle}} expressed in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda, ( [...] "agreements must be kept"). The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit,</b> which was originally a tort action based on reliance. Contract law falls within the general law of obligations, along with tort, unjust enrichment, and restitution.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century, the great bulk of {{litigation}} in England was conducted through the various forms <b>of</b> <b>action</b> which had developed from trespass. This remained the case until the nineteenth century, when these kinds <b>of</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were abolished in succession by statute. By 1875, all remaining forms had been replaced by a single form uniform writ whereby the plaintiff endorses the statement for a claim. By that time, the change was purely procedural, but it also freed the substantive law from the old medieval forms <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> It permitted the development of broad concepts, such as liability in tort which could never have come about when confined by the old forms <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> such as trover. This served to rationalize the law. Just as forms <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> replaced debt, so in the seventeenth century trover replaced detinue.|$|R
5000|$|Quantum valebant is a Latin phrase meaning [...] "as much as {{they were}} worth." [...] It is a common count at law very similar to quantum meruit.

5000|$|The <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit,</b> {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of which is traced to Slade's Case (1602). The medieval law of contract developed in a fractured way through the old actions of covenant, debt and account. In the 1500s litigants began to use the action on the case to enforce contractual agreements (with the exception of contracts under seal, for which debt sur obligation was required), a shift vindicated in Slade's Case. The modern law of contract then gradually began to take shape.|$|E

The quality of legal argument was high; Bacon was a [...] "skillful, subtle intelect" [...] capable of distinguishing the precedent brought up by Coke, while Doddridge, a member of the Society of Antiquaries, knew the records even better than Coke did. Coke, rather than directly confronting opposing counsel, made a twofold argument; firstly, that the fact that the King's Bench had been allowed to hear assumpsit actions for so long meant that it was acceptable, based on institutional inertia, and second that, on the subject <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> being used for breaches of promise, that the original agreement included an implied promise to make payment.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the theme of contract and its symbolic connotations of societas or fellowship, {{in the context of}} Shakespeare’s The Comedy of Errors and its performance on 28 December at the Gray’s Inn revels of Christmas 1594. Central to the argument is the extraordinary advancement of contract law in Elizabethan England, and in particular the significance of the promise to the status of binding bilateral agreements. In particular, the analysis considers the promotion <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> at the expense <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> for debt in relation to a society (and a legal profession) whose mores were heavily influenced by humanist notions of the individual conscience, which simultaneously bound the subject of law into an ethical association with his fellow citizens and freed him (at least putatively) from the constraints of immutable, ancient law. The Comedy of Errors provides a perceptive critique of a society which is bound together only by the market, having abandoned or mislaid the true bonds of friendship and love, through which a just community may be recognised...|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} in a wager {{of law is}} traced by Blackstone to the Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10; but it seems historically to have been derived from the system of compurgation, introduced into England from Normandy, a system which is now thought to have had an appreciable effect {{on the development of}} the English jury. It also has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the sponsao and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference to oath of Scots law (see Oath). The use of the oath instead of the real or feigned combat - real in English law, feigned in Roman law - no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term sacramentum is the bond of union between the two stages of law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in court, and the defendant swore that he did not owe the debt, or (in detinue) that he did not detain the plaintiff's chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed that he spoke the truth. It was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension. Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was nota person of good character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any form <b>of</b> <b>action</b> other than those named, even though the cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were the same. No wager of law was allowed in assumpsit, even though the cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit</b> - proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise by the defendant - as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished in 1833 (3 & 4 William IV. c. 42).|$|R

50|$|For example, in a writ of debt sur contract, the {{defendant}} could generally elect between having {{a jury trial}} or wager of law. The latter was a particularly undesired option for a plaintiff because {{the defendant}} could hire oath-helpers. This and other restrictions (for example, that the sum the plaintiff sued for {{had to be a}} fixed rather than an unliquidated sum) made debt sur contract undesirable for enforcing oral contracts. In the 16th century, litigants began to bring an action on the case instead: an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>assumpsit.</b> The plaintiff would allege that, because the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had undertook (assumpsit) to pay the money. The Court of King's Bench gradually accepted that the subsequent promise did not need not be proven: the defendant's alleged promise to pay the antecedent debt would be supplied by law. This view was vindicated in Slade's Case (1602).|$|E

The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially John Stuart Mill's influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.|$|E
