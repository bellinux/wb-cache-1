In discussion of this, she said, [...] "That C-word thing actually did happen. I was furious, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> weird reaction where I kept saying, 'You can't say that! My parents love me!'" [...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It {{was a little bit}}. It was a little bit based on the experience of having someone call you that and not knowing how to deal with it.". [...] In December 2015 Fey revealed that the writer who called her [...] "the c word" [...] was Colin Quinn.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{just short}} 60 second videos edited in iMovie and {{uploaded}} to Vimeo, the first episodes of Jake and Amir were just something Jake and Amir did to make each-other laugh. Eventually, however, the videos gained such popularity that CollegeHumor started paying {{them to create}} them full-time. Jake explains that Jake and Amir was never {{intended to be a}} series, [...] "We actually had no idea we were creating a series at the time we were doing it. I just thought Amir was so funny, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> crappy camera. We just made these videos and our friends started passing them around. It kind of grew from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November 1968, {{two days}} before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an {{exclusive}} interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs. Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E

[...] "King Gos has been conquered by a boy Prince from the far island of Pingaree, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> day--unaided--destroyed Choggenmugger by the might of my strong arm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{come from}} the high seat upon {{the edge of the}} cliff," [...] she answered, [...] "where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sat all day, for I can no longer bear these sights, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> to tell, that the Zulus are marching across the plain, but not towards Zululand, since they head for the Quathlamba Mountains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I was so happy. I {{wrote back}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> letter from him today. He {{is coming down}} tomorrow. You'll be glad to see him, won't you, Auntie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This, and the Opera, and the quarrels {{of the two}} prime donne, and {{the beauty}} of one of them, formed the chief {{subjects}} of conversation; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> important news in the shop of a certain barber in the town, who conveyed it in a language composed of French, Spanish, and Italian, and with a volubility quite worthy of a barber of [...] "Gil Blas." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{force the}} spars {{away from the}} ship {{was not an easy}} task of itself. There is an {{attraction}} in matter, that is known to bring vessels nearer together in calms, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> principle of nature first to overcome; then to neutralize it, without the adequate means for doing either. Still I was very strong, and possessed all the resources of a seaman. The raft, too, now its length was reduced, was much more manageable than it had been originally, and in rummaging about the twixt-decks, I had found a set of oars belonging to the launch, which had been stowed in the steerage, and which of course were preserved. These I had taken to the raft, to strengthen my staging, or deck, and two of them had been reserved for the very purpose to which they were now applied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{his death}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an {{interview}} with my nearest kinsman, who has taken sides with the Imperialists, <b>and</b> to him <b>I</b> offered to resign Thekla's rights as heiress to the estate for the sum of 10,000 crowns. As this was but three years revenue of the estates, and it secured their possession to him whether the Imperialists or Swedes were victorious in the struggle, he consented, after having obtained the emperor's consent to the step, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> morning {{received a letter from}} him saying that the money has been lodged {{in the hands of the}} banker at Hamburg, <b>and</b> Thekla <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> morning signed a deed renouncing in his favour all claim to the estate. Thus Thekla has a dowry of 20,000 gold crowns--a sum not unworthy of a dowry even for the daughter of a Count of Mansfeld; but with it you must take me also, for I would fain leave the country and end my days with her." ...|$|R

"Bethink you, reverend lord," [...] said Piercie Shafton, very eagerly, [...] "ere you resign {{the defence}} {{that is in}} your power--there are many posts near the entry of this village, where brave men might live or die to the advantage; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> {{additional}} motive to make defence,--the safety, namely, of a fair friend, who, I hope, hath escaped {{the hands of the}} heretics." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{group was}} formed in 2001.

6000|$|... 'Good gracious!' said Mrs. Hauksbee. 'He {{never told}} me what the turn would be! My {{education}} has been horribly neglected; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only <b>this</b> foolish mother-woman to fall back upon.' ...|$|R

5000|$|... “It’s an {{incredible}} feeling,” said Busch. “It’s a total team effort.

5000|$|We put {{ourselves}} through enormous pain to avoid pain <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> notion of: 'What if we didn't do that? What {{if we just}} told the truth?" [...] he said.

5000|$|In 1987, Young told an {{interviewer}} that Time Fades Away was [...] "the worst record I ever made - but as a documentary {{of what was happening}} to me, it was a great record. I was onstage and I was playing all these songs that nobody had heard before, recording them, and I didn't have the right band. It was just an uncomfortable tour.

5000|$|Black {{specified}} in an interview, [...] "It {{was the year}} Yellowstone caught on fire, 1988.

5000|$|The cover artwork for {{the album}} was created by Chan Marshall out of a {{postcard}}: [...] "I just needed a cover <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> postcard that I've had for a long time.

5000|$|Underlining {{this change}} in {{character}} and the choosing of the new moniker, Tillman admits the following in an interview for the Dallas Observer: [...] "I used to do these J.

Then, in between songs, I would start being myself and shooting the shit and telling jokes. ...

5000|$|Rosanne Cash {{was quite}} {{critical}} of the film. She saw a rough edit and described the experience like [...] "having a root canal without anaesthetic". Her half-brother John Carter Cash was instrumental in having the filmmakers remove two scenes that were not flattering to her mother. Furthermore, she said, [...] "The movie was painful. The three of them the film were not recognizable to me as my parents in any way.
