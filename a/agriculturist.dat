The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time. The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both {{red and yellow}} carrots, as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian <b>agriculturist,</b> Ibn al-'Awwam.

5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British <b>agriculturist</b> Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E

40|$|Many Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> rely {{on small}} family farms for their livelihood. The farm is their {{source of income}} and may be an {{important}} inheritance for their family when they retire or die. Land succession planning is a process to allow landowners to pass farmland on to the next generation without incurring a potentially debilitating tax liability for the heirs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the influence of place attachment on land succession planning of Nebraska <b>agriculturists.</b> This comparative research, mixed methods in nature, involves Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> who have a land succession plan and Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> who do not have a land succession plan, and are both within 10 years of retirement (52 years of age) and beyond retirement. The qualitative portion explored how Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> with and without a succession plan described their place attachment to their land. Ten themes emerged from the qualitative analysis on the Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> with a will. Eight themes emerged from the qualitative analysis on the Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> without a will. Two themes, nature bonding and family bonding, were held in common. In the quantitative portion explaining place attachment, Nebraska agriculturalists with a will had significantly higher place identity, place dependence, nature bonding, and overall place attachment than Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> without a will. The two hypotheses that were not supported were for greater family bonding and friend bonding in Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> with a will than Nebraska <b>agriculturists</b> without a will. This study opens the door for further place attachment research in other states to assist in outreach programs in succession planning for <b>agriculturists.</b> Adviser: Mark E. Burbac...|$|R
