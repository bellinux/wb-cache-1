5|$|The <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> {{imperial}} titles by Zenobia {{signaled a}} usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline {{of events and}} why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In {{the second half of}} 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability of open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would be useless; her <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.|$|E

5|$|Why Halotus in {{particular}} was chosen for such a high-paid position is unclear. Why Halotus was even spared is also unclear, as almost all of Nero's former servants were killed on Galba's <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> the throne, as Suetonius notes above.|$|E
