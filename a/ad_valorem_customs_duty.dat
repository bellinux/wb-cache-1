40|$|The eight GATT Rounds of {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} have been very successful in reducing <b>customs</b> <b>duties.</b> Over 47 years, the average duty on industrial products imposed by developed countries has impressively decreased from about 40 per cent <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> to 3. 9 per cent <b>ad</b> <b>valorem.</b> A survey of the Post-Uruguay Round individual tariff structures shows, however, that tariffs are still an important barrier in international trade. Most developing countries have either bound their tariffs at relatively high rates, the average of which ranges between 25 and 50 per cent <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> for industrial products, or they have bound {{only a limited number}} of items. Developed countries have bound all or most of their non-agricultural tariff lines; their <b>customs</b> <b>duties,</b> which are low on average, show however significant peaks on “sensitive” products such as textiles, clothing and leather goods,which are of particular export interest to developing countries. Least developed countries (LDCs) benefit from preferences by developed countries, though a preferential treatment is similarly accorded to some developing countries and to other developed countries under the provisions of regional trade agreements. Therefore, it is not surprising that an important part of the Doha Round Agenda is still devoted to tariff negotiations. However, as in general the relevance of tariffs as trade barriers has considerably lowered, the interest of the Doha Round negotiators is largely revolving around the elimination or reduction of non-tariff measures and domestic regulatory policies. In this domain, the negotiating efforts made since the Kennedy Round have indeed produced less visible results than those reached through the tariff liberalisation proces...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe compare various {{designs of}} energy {{efficiency}} subsidies {{in a market}} subject to both energy-use externalities and price-quality discrimination by a monopolist. We find that differentiated subsidies can establish the social optimum. Unlike per-quality regimes, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> regimes generate downstream interferences: Subsidising of the high-end good leads the monopolist to reduce {{the quality of the}} low-end good. For this reason, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> differentiated rates should always decrease with energy efficiency, a result seemingly at odds with actual practice. In contrast, with per-quality differentiated subsidies, the rates can increase if the externality is large enough relative to the market share of "low" type consumers. Contrary to differentiated subsidies, what we shall call single-instrument subsidies only achieve second-best outcomes. A uniform <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> subsidy should have a rate higher than that needed to specifically internalise energy-use externalities. Lastly, if, as is often observed in practice, only the high-end good is to be incentivised, a per-quality regime should be preferred to an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> one.

In a context of costly public funds the <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation on the variable fee dominates specific taxation. Moreover, the ranking between <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation on the fixed fee and an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation on the variable fee depends on the relative magnitude of economic parameters, in particular the degree of differentation.
