5|$|The {{issue of}} {{offering}} vocational training {{was part of}} a larger challenge for Morgan in her first few years at the university. Because of the school's status as a land-grant university, the program was required to follow California State Department of Education directives to produce graduates trained as teachers, <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> specialists and dietitians. However, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the university in the early 20th century, saw those fields as vocations, and he encouraged Morgan to continue her focus on science.|$|E

For the initial costs of such production until harvest revenues are generated, microloans are provided to farmers by non-profit agencies of the AKDN. In addition to microfinance and education, the agency works to improve the health and sanitation conditions of its beneficiaries, and considers employee welfare to be of paramount concern, providing equitable opportunity between genders and making child-care provisions for its employees.|$|E

40|$|As <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> {{education}} {{at the university level}} revamps its image for the new millennium, it may be wise to recognize its growing diversity and seek more compatible options for women in the workforce. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the unique challenges regarding personal lives, barriers unique to women in the field, and mentoring and support systems available to women involved in <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> {{education at}} the university level. “Changes in education and societal thinking are key components in encouraging young women in non-traditional fields ” (Johnson, 1997). The three themes reported in this study reflected a broad view of the issues facing women entering the profession of <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> {{education at the}} university level. 1) Women in the field who feel encouraged seem to be happy and have a strong commitment to their role in the profession. 2) Mentoring networks and support systems are too few and do not meet the needs of the women in the field. 3) Barriers to women in the profession are real and need to be addressed. The barriers perceived by women in <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education may be far more real than we would like to think.

40|$|The {{profession}} of <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education {{has increased in}} complexity {{in response to the}} demands of the changing field of agriculture and the need for educators who are responsive to those demands. A standardization of the knowledge base of the profession is seen as necessary in light of geographic mobility, the nationwide emphasis on assessment, and the need for a public relations tool that clearly articulates the concepts forming the framework of <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education. In this study a panel of experts consisting of <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education leaders nationwide, responded to open-ended and Likert-type surveys online as part of a Delphi technique to establish the knowledge base for <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education. Three rounds of the Delphi technique were used. A minimum of 13 of the 24 panel members were required to respond to each round. Ninety-five statements were initially generated by 16 panel members in response to an open-ended statement in Round I which asked the participants ??What are the articulated understandings, skills, and judgments that serve as the foundation of knowledge (??the body??) for professionals in <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education??? These statements were presented to the panel members in Round II. Two-thirds of the panelists had to ??Strongly Agree?? or ??Agree?? with each item for it to be retained for Round III. Based on the responses of 14 panelists in Round II, 67 items were retained for Round III, and one item was added based on panel input. After Round III, three items were eliminated due to lack of twothirds achievement of ??Strongly Agree?? and ??Agree?? ratings by 17 respondents. Thus, 65 statements established the knowledge base of <b>agricultural</b> and <b>extension</b> education in this study. Among the knowledge base are concepts related to traits of effective educators; management issues; environmental impacts on instruction; curriculum development; learner-based contextual, applied pedagogical strategies; leadership development; communications; assessment strategies; community and collegial connections; integration of technology; critical thinking and problem solving; and teaching as a changing process grounded in sound theory...|$|R
