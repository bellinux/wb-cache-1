5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, {{in sharp contrast}} to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E

25|$|When Thomas's {{father died}} in 1622, he was bequeathed {{properties}} in Stratford: the Bear Inn (opposite the Swan) and a house in Bridge Street, {{and a piece of}} land called “the Butt Close by the Avon” where burghers used to shoot at archery butts. Thomas was an executor to his father's will. It appears that Thomas held on to the Bear Inn: his father-in-law, Dr. John Hall, once treated someone that he called one of Thomas's servants “lying at the Bear”, presumably indicating that he was a publican or worker at that inn. Hall's first treatment for the poor heavily jaundiced servant elicited “seven Vomits”, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> a series of further treatments “cured him perfectly”.|$|E
25|$|The HS.404's predecessor, the Oerlikon type S auto-cannon, {{was rather}} heavy <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> the {{movement}} of the heavy bolt made it best suited in static and maritime anti-aircraft defence. In contrast the lighter bolt of the HS.404 made it well suited to mounting on vehicles. The M16, an anti-aircraft version of the M3 Half-track, could be equipped with single or double American made copies of the Hispano-Suiza auto-cannon. This variant of the M3 Half-track was used by US and Commonwealth forces late in the Second World War and in the Korean War and was further developed by Israel in the post-war era.|$|E
25|$|The Latin Kingdom {{continued}} to exist, theoretically, {{on the island}} of Cyprus. There the Latin kings schemed and planned to recapture the mainland, but in vain. Money, men, and the will to do the task were all lacking. One last effort was made by King Peter I in 1365, when he successfully landed in Egypt and sacked Alexandria. Once the city was pillaged, however, the Crusaders returned as speedily as possible to Cyprus to divide their loot. As a crusade, the episode was futile, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> further coastal raids over the following decades led in 1410–11 to a destructive counter-raid by the Mamelukes; in 1426 Cyprus was forced into Mameluke vassalship with a hefty yearly tribute.|$|E

25|$|Despite a move of yards, Yarrows outgrew its London site <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> {{the cost}} of land and labour in London led to a second move to what {{was at that time}} a {{greenfield}} site at Scotstoun in the west of Glasgow, beginning in 1906. Between 4,000 and 5,000 tons of material had to be transported, from models to heavy machine tools. A train-load of from forty to fifty wagons left the works at Poplar every day. The first vessel launched from the new works at Scotstoun on 14 July 1908 was the lead ship of the Pará-class destroyers for the Brazilian Navy. The company also established the Coventry Ordnance Works joint venture in 1905, building a large factory near to its Scotstoun Shipyard in 1910. During the First World War, the company developed the pioneering Erskine artificial limb with Sir William Macewen.|$|E
25|$|The nave, as {{with the}} chancel and north aisle, shows a banding {{construction}} from the ground to eaves in alternate courses of ironstone and ashlar. On its west are gabled buttresses, two at each corner, and one at the centre running {{to the point of}} the ridge—a further buttress supports the south wall, and all are topped by pinnacles inset with arched panels below crocketed spires. A bas relief Annunciation is worked into the top of the central west buttress, <b>and</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> south facing buttresses, contain gabled statue niches with trefoiled inset surrounds. Two Decorated late 13th-century windows are placed in the west wall, one either side of the central buttress. They are of three lancets, with pointed heads, geometrical tracery—typically circular rosette devices dating from c.1250–1310—and hood moulds. Below the west wall south window is a late 14th-century door, now blocked, within an ogee-headed stone surround. The spandrels between the ogee and outer rectilinear enclosure contain on one side a dragon motif, and on the other, a shield. Beneath and attached to the ogee head are three grotesque bosses—a probable fourth is missing—as stops to the foiled moulding. The nave south wall is surmounted by a plain parapet holding projecting gargoyles. It contains two windows, each of four lights—one Decorated, the other with Perpendicular tracery—and both with hood moulds. Two small 15th-century windows sit beneath the easterly window, one of two lights, the other single.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{also uses}} color and visual art {{techniques}} to convey emotional range in his {{descriptions of the}} Irati River. In Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Ronald Berman compares Hemingway's treatment of landscape {{with that of the}} post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. During a 1949 interview, Hemingway told Lillian Ross that he learned from Cézanne how to [...] "make a landscape." [...] In comparing writing to painting he told her, [...] "This is {{what we try to do}} in writing, this <b>and</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> woods, and the rocks we have to climb over." [...] The landscape is seen subjectively—the viewpoint of the observer is paramount. To Jake, landscape [...] "meant a search for a solid form.... not existentially present in [...] life in Paris." ...|$|E

500|$|As January 2005 drew near, Carey {{had already}} {{completed}} many tracks for her yet-untitled studio album. However, after releasing the album's title, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] leaked, and {{was to be}} promoted as the project's lead single. While the song was universally chosen as Carey's next single, former Island Records head L.A. Reid suggested Carey travel to Atlanta {{for a period of}} three days to work with Jermaine Dupri. In an interview with MTV, Carey recalled the decision with Reid: [...] "L.A. was like, 'You and Jermaine Dupri make magic together, why aren't you in the studio with him? I said, 'I love Jermaine, is he free? I know he's doing a million things, Usher <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> that.' But Jermaine said, 'Come on down.'" [...] During the following interval of three days, the pair helmed the album's eventual third and fourth singles, [...] "Shake It Off" [...] and [...] "Get Your Number". During her trip to Atlanta, Carey began second guessing the album's direction, and described her feelings regarding the decision in an interview with MTV News: ...|$|E

2500|$|Dylan {{talked about}} his {{difficulty}} at the recording sessions {{in an interview with}} Guitar World magazine. [...] "I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it's {{very difficult for me to}} think that I'm going to eclipse anything I've ever done before. I get bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> that." [...] In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.|$|E

In the Paris Psalter, Moses, Jonah and Isaiah are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E

2500|$|O'Reilly {{attended}} St. Brigid {{parochial school}} in Westbury, and Chaminade High School, a private Catholic boys {{high school in}} Mineola. His father wanted him to attend Chaminade, but O'Reilly wanted to attend W.Tresper Clarke High School, the public school most of his closest friends would attend. He played Little League baseball and was the goalie on the Chaminade varsity hockey team. During his high school years, he met future pop-singer Billy Joel, whom O'Reilly described as a [...] "hoodlum". O'Reilly recollected {{in an interview with}} Michael Kay on the YES Network show CenterStage that Joel [...] "was in the Hicksville section—the same age as me—and he was a hood.

West Indian captain Aucher Warner asked him why: he replied that he could bowl properly only when barefooted. Woods was making the best response he knew to a truly desperate situation." [...] Sammy Woods in his autobiography reports that Jessop [...] "hit the two famous Black Bowlers (Cumberbatch and Woods) so furiously that not only they couldn't bowl for laughter, {{but the rest of the}} dark ones in the field rolled about and set up a howl of delight". Archie Cumberbatch was, of course, not on the tour at all <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> other remarks are probably embellished.

2500|$|BRM {{had some}} {{previous}} experience of stressed skin construction with the BRM P25, so Rudd {{was in a}} good position to be able to exploit the new technology to the full. This previous experience meant that Rudd's use of the monocoque was somewhat different from the pioneering Lotus's frame. Where the 25 had been a channel-section frame with an open top, within which the driver sat, the P261 chassis was a slim tubular-section, into which a hole was cut to allow the driver to gain access. To replace the P61's subframe the side pontoons of the P261 chassis were extended behind the driver's seat, and the engine was mounted between them. Within the pontoons, rubber cells were used to retain fuel. This caused complications early in the P261's life, as BRM's new, high-exhaust version of the P56 V8 engine was not ready {{for the start of the}} 1964 season, and holes had to be cut in the pontoons to allow the exhaust pipes of the older, low-exhaust version to pass through them. The centre exhaust engine appeared at the 1964 Italian Grand Prix in Graham Hill's new chassis [...] "2616" [...] <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> [...] "2617", which was Jackie Stewart's regular car in 1965, were the only two P261s which did not have the exhaust slots. These were plated over on the earlier cars which remained in service, but could be opened up if necessary to fit outside exhaust engines, as happened in the 1967 Tasman Championship.|$|E
