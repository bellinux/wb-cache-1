500|$|Musically, Animal {{is of the}} dance-pop and electro-pop genres, while {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} electro in its production and beats. Kesha's vocals uses Auto-Tune and vocoders to alter her voice and includes samples. David Jeffries of AllMusic noted that the album lyrically revolves around avoiding reality with a preference for a [...] "garbage chic" [...] life, with lyrics such as [...] "Maybe I need some rehab, or maybe just need some sleep" [...] from the opening song [...] "Your Love Is My Drug". Lyrically, {{the majority of the}} album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time. [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] is a dance song that is layered with a heavy electronic backdrop. Her vocals throughout the song have been described as a shouty sing-speak style. Musically, the song uses a simple, upbeat lyric line. On [...] "Tik Tok" [...] Kesha uses a spoken word rap style on the verses while the chorus is sung.

[...] "Take It Off" [...] has been described as [...] "a heavily Auto-Tuned reworking" [...] of [...] "There's a Place in France".|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all about letting loose <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known {{a little too much}} [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
500|$|On October 24, 2013, it was {{confirmed}} through Japanese publication Natalie.mu that Hamasaki would release a new double A-side single titled [...] "Feel the Love/"Merry-Go-Round", and {{would serve as}} the singers's first physical release in three years since her EP–single L (2010). It was also her first double A-side single, alongside the track [...] "Merry-Go-Round", since [...] "Moon" [...] and [...] "Blossom" [...] that same year. The track was written by Hamasaki, whilst production was handled by Japanese musician and long-time collaborator Max Matsuura {{with the assistance of}} DJ Hello Kitty, the latter producer emphasised as a marketing strategy to portray Hello Kitty as a DJ; this marks the singer's first single to be produced with another producer instead of a sole production by Matsuura. It also marks the first ever track or recording produced and composed by DJ Hello Kitty. Musically, [...] "Feel the Love" [...] is an electronic dance song that lyrically focuses on love <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time. The song was composed by Japanese Globe member and producer Tetsuya Komuro, and featured backing vocals by Japanese musician Yumi Kawamura; it also features synthesizers and keyboards in its instrumentation.

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} Fever chiefly focuses on themes {{of love and}} enjoyment. Thompson {{described}} the album to be [...] "all about dancing, fucking, <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time". In the song [...] "Love at First Sight", Minogue describes how {{she fell in love}} with her partner at [...] "first sight" [...] and how it led to good things happening for her. [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was termed a [...] "mystery" [...] as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists" [...] as her obsession. The production of [...] "Give It to Me" [...] contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to [...] "slow down," [...] but the beat [...] "goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Fragile" [...] are simple and aim directly at the [...] " [...] heart". [...] "Come into My World" [...] is a [...] "plea for love" [...] as Minogue invites her partner into her life. On the other hand, [...] "Dancefloor" [...] focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by [...] "lose it in the music".|$|E
500|$|Albert Joseph [...] "Joey" [...] Fischer Jr. {{was born}} in Brownsville, Texas, on January 16, 1975. His parents were A. J. [...] "Buddy" [...] Fischer and Corinne Nelson. The couple {{divorced}} in 1987 and remarried separately. Fischer {{lived with his mother}} and his stepfather Vernon [...] "Beau" [...] Nelson. He was a senior honors student at Saint Joseph Academy (St. Joe), a Catholic private school in Brownsville. He had a 98.5 grade-point average, was ranked eleventh in his class, and was going to attend the honors program at the University of Texas at Austin on graduation. At 18 years old, he enjoyed basketball and was a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, loved computers, and talked about pursuing a career as an engineer. Along with two other classmates, he was voted [...] "Most Sarcastic" [...] by his high school class, and was known for sometimes acting foolish, <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sense of humor. He was also [...] "often attracted to the more Latina girls of the school". During his junior year, he dated Cristina, who was a year younger than him. Most of Fischer's friends described her as quiet, although some said she was only reserved with people she did not know. Cristina's mother Dora Garcia Cisneros approved of Fischer's relationship with her daughter and thought he was potentially a good candidate for marriage. In Cisneros's eyes, Fischer was an overachieving student from a good family, and [...] "wasn't wild, like many of the St. Joe boys".|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is {{the most}} {{prominent}} representation of rock music on The Time of Our Lives. The track features instrumentation that relies on glam electric guitar riffing and ragged, gutsy vocals, which, at several points, feature a gravelly element. It results in an uptempo electronic rock number. Lyrically, [...] "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is a merciless message to an ex-boyfriend. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] mixes R and pop music elements while having instrumentation that includes a [...] "clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as a hook". Cyrus' vocals display an undertone of alternative country twang and features belter refrains. The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] discuss Cyrus' relocation from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. The refrains mainly speak of how her favorite songs make her feel more confident. [...] "When I Look at You" [...] is a power ballad that transitions in instrumentation, from piano to electric guitar. Throughout the song, Cyrus keeps a hushed tone, but starts to belt soon {{before the arrival of}} the second verse. Lyrically, it speaks of a dream lover. [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] is a bouncy, dance-pop song characterized by 1980s synths and a fizzy sound caused by a bubblegum pop background. Cyrus' processed vocals display a prominent use of auto-tune; influences derive from new wave music. The song's lyrics talk about not worrying so much about the future and simply focusing on the present <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time together. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] is a pop-punk, garage rock song with disco influences and a number of hooks. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] features lyrics that speak of being extremely irritated after encountering predicaments at a club and others smoking cigarettes. [...] "Obsessed" [...] is a power ballad with soft rock characteristics and husky vocals. [...] "Obsessed"'s lyrics deal with teenage lust.
