40|$|This study compares two {{confirmatory factor}} {{analysis}} methods {{on their ability to}} verify whether correct assignments of items to subtests are supported by the data. The confirmatory common factor (CCF) method is used most often and defines nonzero loadings so that they correspond to the assignment of items to subtests. Another method is the oblique multiple group (OMG) method, which defines subtests as unweighted sums of the scores on all items assigned to the subtest, and (corrected) correlations are used to verify the assignment. A simulation study compares both methods, accounting for the influence of model error and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> unique <b>variance.</b> The CCF and OMG methods show similar behavior with relatively small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> unique <b>variance</b> and low interfactor correlations. However, at high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> unique <b>variance</b> and high interfactor correlations, the CCF detected correct assignments more often, whereas the OMG was better at detecting incorrect assignments...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{replicate}} {{the finding that}} illness perceptions influence {{quality of life in}} adults with muscle disease and to explore the additional influence of coping and optimism on quality of life and mood. DESIGN: A postal survey including questionnaires recording quality of life, mood, illness perceptions, optimism, coping and functional impairment. SETTING: National Health Service muscle clinics in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of adults with muscle disease. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individualised Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: A total of 226 completed questionnaires were returned. Although functional impairment explained most <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> in three out of eight quality of life domains, psychological factors explained greater <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> (between 19 % and 52 % <b>of</b> <b>variance)</b> in all other quality of life domains and in both mood domains (between 45 % and 48 % <b>of</b> <b>variance).</b> Overall, illness perceptions explained much <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> in quality <b>of</b> life and mood score (between 5 % and 37 % <b>of</b> <b>variance),</b> while coping (up to 8 % <b>of</b> <b>variance)</b> and optimism (up to 15 % <b>of</b> <b>variance)</b> explained smaller <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance.</b> CONCLUSION: The results confirm that illness perceptions are associated with quality of life in muscle disease and suggest that they also influence mood. The addition of optimism and coping variables into the analysis yielded small increases in the proportions <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> in quality <b>of</b> life and mood which were explained. These results have implications for the composition of future psychological interventions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background {{and aims}} Descriptions of {{compulsive}} buying often emphasize {{the roles of}} negative moods and trait impulsivity {{in the development of}} problematic buying habits. Trait impulsivity is sometimes treated as a unidimensional trait in compulsive buying research, but recent factor analyses suggest that impulsivity consists of multiple components that are probably best treated as independent predictors of problem behavior. In order to draw greater attention to the role of positive moods in compulsive buying, in this study we tested whether negative urgency (the tendency to act rashly while in negative moods) and positive urgency (the tendency to act rashly while in positive moods) account for similar <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> in compulsive buying. Methods North American adults (N = 514) completed an online survey containing the Richmond Compulsive Buying Scale (Ridgway, Kukar-Kinney & Monroe, 2008), established measures of positive and negative urgency (Cyders et al., 2007), ad hoc measures of buying-specific positive and negative urgency, measures of extraversion and neuroticism obtained from the International Personality Item Pool ([URL] and demographic questions. Results In several multiple regression analyses, when demographic variables, neuroticism, and extraversion were controlled, positive urgency and negative urgency both emerged as significant predictors of compulsive buying. Whether the two urgency variables were domain-general or buying-specific, they accounted for similar <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> in compulsive buying. Conclusions Preventing and reducing compulsive buying may require attention not only to the purchasing decisions people make while in negative states, but also to the purchasing decisions they make while in positive states...|$|R
