In the loop of functioning windings, we include diodes and those windings with diodes are opposite-parallel connected. Diodes {{are the source}} of increasing amplification coefficients and thus permit to control magnetic <b>amplifier</b> <b>with</b> low control windings currents.

40|$|We {{will report}} on {{progress}} in quasi-optical power amplifiers at Caltech since last year’s meeting, where we reported a 5 -W, Ka-band grid <b>amplifier</b> <b>with</b> a waveguide mode converter. This year {{we have developed}} an indium-phosphide V-band grid amplifier. The amplifier has been tested both as a transmission <b>amplifier</b> <b>with</b> a waveguide mode converter on the input and output side, and as a reflection <b>amplifier</b> <b>with</b> an orthomode transducer input feed. Both show shown a modest gain of 2 dB at 58 GHz. These are single-stage amplifiers, and this indicates {{that it would be}} desirable to develop <b>amplifiers</b> <b>with</b> two stages of gain on chip...|$|R

For parametric amplification, a beta-barium borate crystal is pumped by a 140 W, 1 ps Yb: YAG InnoSlab amplifier at 3. 25 MHz repetition rate. The broadband seed is generated via supercontinuum generation in a YAG crystal...|$|R
