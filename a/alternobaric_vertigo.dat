25|$|<b>Alternobaric</b> <b>vertigo</b> {{is caused}} by a {{pressure}} difference between the middle ear cavities, usually due to blockage or partial blockage of one eustachian tube, usually when flying or diving underwater. It is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position; the spinning is towards the ear with the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60cm of water or more.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Pre- 1970 s, diving {{was seen}} as a {{predominantly}} male working occupation. Since then it has become a popular hobby, with increasing access to SCUBA diving while on holiday. For a leisure activity, diving puts the auditory system at the risk {{of a wide variety of}} complaints. However, there is still insufficient consensus on the fre-quency of these conditions, which ultimately would require more attention from hearing-healthcare professionals. A literature search of epidemiology studies of eight auditory complaints was conducted, using both individual and large-scale diving studies, with some reference to large-scale non-diving populations. A higher incidence was found for middle ear barotrauma, eustachian tube dysfunction, and <b>alternobaric</b> <b>vertigo</b> with a high correlation among females. Comparing these findings with a non-diving population found no statistically significant difference for hearing loss or tinnitus. Increased awareness of health professionals is required, training, and implementation of the Frenzel technique would help resolve the ambiguities of the Val-salva technique underwater...|$|E
