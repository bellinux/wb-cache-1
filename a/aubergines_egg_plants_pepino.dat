50|$|The solanaceas {{include such}} {{important}} food species as the potato (Solanum tuberosum), the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the pepper (Capsicum annuum) and the <b>aubergine</b> or <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> (Solanum melongena). Nicotiana tabacum, originally from South America, is now cultivated {{throughout the world}} to produce tobacco.Many solanaceas are important weeds {{in various parts of}} the world. Their importance lies in the fact that they can host pathogens or diseases of the cultivated plants, therefore their presence increases the loss of yield or the quality of the harvested product. An example of this can be seen with Acnistus arborescens and Browalia americana that host thrips, which cause damage to associated cultivated plants, and certain species of Datura that play host to various types of virus that are later transmitted to cultivated solanaceas. Some species of weeds such as, Solanum mauritianum in South Africa represent such serious ecological and economic problems that studies are being carried out with the objective of developing a biological control through the use of insects.|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Biu, Borno State, Nigeria during 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of intercropping on the infestation and damage of <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> fruit borer (Daraba laisalis Wlk). The {{experiment was}} laid out in a randomized block design with three intercrops and one sole crop treatments replicated four times. The results obtained from the study showed that the population of <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> fruit borer was reported minimum in the condition when <b>egg</b> <b>plants</b> were intercropped with cereal crops and the maximum population was reported from the sole crop of <b>egg</b> <b>plant.</b> Similarly types of trends were reported in the case of fruit damage and final yield.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the effect of Solanum melongena (garden <b>egg</b> <b>plant),</b> apple and oat on serum lipid profile of rats fed a hyper{{cholesterol}}emic diet. One hundred rats were grouped into five groups of 20 animals each; one group was fed with grower`s marsh alone and acted as the sham control. One group was fed grower`s marsh and 3 % cholesterol and served as the test control. The other three groups were fed with the grower`s marsh, 3 % cholesterol and either of 4 % apple, oat, or garden <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> for a period of one month. After 2 weeks, half of the animals in each group were sacrificed for mid-term studies. The results obtained indicate that garden <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced weight gain of rats and feed efficiency compared with the other supplementations. Garden <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and increased serum HDL-cholesterol compared with oat and apple in both the mid-term and full-term studies. The study suggests that garden <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> has a more hypolipidemic effect than apple and oat...|$|R

Thirteen male rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} control (C), hypercholesterolemic (H) and <b>egg</b> <b>plant</b> (E) treated groups (n = 10 each). The H and E rabbits were fed a diet supplemented with cholesterol (0. 5 %) and coconut oil (10 %) for 4 weeks. In addition, group E received 10 mL of the fruit juice/day during the last 2 weeks. The animals were killed and the aorta removed to measure MDA content and the endothelium dependent relaxation responses. Total plasma cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, HDL and triglyceride levels were determined using commercial kits. MDA was quantified in native and oxidized LDL and in the arterial wall. After 4 weeks, the E group rabbits had a significantly lower weight, plasma cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride and aortic cholesterol content than group H(p < 0. 05). The MDA content that was significantly increased in the LDL particles and in the arterial wall of H rabbits was reduced in the E group (p < 0. 05). Endothelium-dependent relaxation were significantly higher in the E group compared H group rabbits (p < 0. 05).
