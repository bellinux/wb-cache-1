5|$|In the Grand Banks of Canada, {{the threat}} of the {{hurricane}} prompted fishing boats to venture back to port. In the Bay of Fundy, foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground. Across Nova Scotia, rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth, a schooner near Halifax, four yachts in Chester, and another three boats in Shelburne ashore. In addition, eleven yachts in Chester sank during the storm. The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect, destroying a garage. In Cow Bay, a man drowned after falling off of <b>a</b> <b>yacht.</b> Rough seas halted ferry service between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, as well as between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; other ferry service across the region were delayed.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports from}} Nukuʻalofa on December31 {{indicated}} severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following {{the passage of}} Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree. Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest {{brought on by the}} storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs. In one instance, <b>a</b> <b>yacht</b> was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both.|$|E

5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over, and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard <b>a</b> <b>yacht.</b> Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be going very well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees as exciting and flattering.|$|E
5|$|On January11, Tropical Depression 04F {{produced}} a record 293.2mm (11.5in) {{of rain in}} a 24‑hour span on Rotuma. However, little damage resulted from the heavy precipitation. Cyclone Tam produced heavy rainfall in American Samoa which triggered damaging floods. Several buildings were flooded, and an estimated 70% of the island's crops were destroyed. Sustained winds of up to 55km/h (35mph), with gusts reaching 95km/h (59mph), tore a few roofs off unsecured homes. Scattered power outages were reported throughout the island. A few landslides were also reported {{as a result of}} the storm. Damage from the storm totaled $26,000 on the island. Relatively little damage was recorded in Futuna; there, the storm downed several trees and stranded <b>a</b> <b>yacht</b> on a reef. On Niuafo'ou, a weather station recorded sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts of up to 75km/h (45mph), along with a minimum pressure of 991hPa (mbar).

5|$|On {{behalf of}} Stern, in January 1973 Heidemann photographed the Carin II, <b>a</b> <b>yacht</b> that {{formerly}} belonged to Göring. The boat {{was in a}} poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a mortgage on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching {{the history of the}} yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the Carin II, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|Rough {{surf and}} {{moderate}} winds from the hurricane capsized several ships along the East Coast of the United States; 30people were left missing and presumed killed from a shipwreck in Chincoteague, Virginia. Along the coast, 57people died {{due to the}} storm. In New Jersey, the hurricane caused heavy damage, particularly near the coast and in Atlantic City. Dozens of buildings were damaged or destroyed, and damage across the state totaled $8million (1903USD). In New York City, high winds disrupted traffic, closed businesses, and overturned wagons, with many windows and roofs damaged. On Long Island, President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced {{the effects of the}} hurricane while on <b>a</b> <b>yacht.</b> The life of the president was briefly threatened by the rough conditions, though none on board the yacht suffered any problems from the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Shipping {{incidents}} {{resulting from}} the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A tug boat sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the American SS Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost.

Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.|$|E
5|$|The tight {{pressure}} gradient between Cyclone Sose and the ridge to its south generated extremely rough seas {{along the eastern}} coast of Australia, especially Queensland. Along the state's southern shore, normally protected from strong swells, waves were as high as 8 m (26 ft) and frequently between 45 m (1316 ft). A 53-year-old man and his 9-year-old son both drowned in the heavy surf near Gladstone on April 8. Offshore Kingscliff, New South Wales, <b>a</b> <b>yacht</b> capsized, forcing its two occupants to swim to land. The large swells proved popular with experienced surfers looking for a challenge. Although the event became infamous within local surfing circles, at least one surfer was hospitalized after being swept against rocks, and several others required rescue. Some beach erosion was reported in several locations, leading to minor sandbagging efforts to hamper the erosion.|$|E
5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of Lake Shore Drive were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake Shore Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and <b>a</b> <b>yacht</b> basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E
