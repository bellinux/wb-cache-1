5|$|<b>A</b> <b>mandatory</b> {{order is}} {{an order of}} the High Court {{commanding}} a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining <b>a</b> <b>mandatory,</b> prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

40|$|What would a {{feasible}} {{system of}} social security in Germany have looked like {{in the year of}} 1995 and beyond? In order to find an answer we describe three base systems: (l) a purely funded system {{of social security}}, (2) <b>a</b> fully <b>mandatory</b> funded system of social security, and (3) <b>a</b> partially <b>mandatory</b> funded system. It is argued that - neglecting problems of transition - a purely funded system would be the best in economic terms; <b>a</b> fully <b>mandatory</b> funded system would need almost as many controls as the currently prevailing system (often labelled pay-asyou- go system). <b>A</b> partially <b>mandatory</b> funded system, assuring some kind of basic income, would need less controls and less governmental authority than the fully mandatory system but more than a funded system. After quantification of two scenarios which represent components of the three base systems, a system of taxation with respect to contributions and/or benefits is discussed which {{is at the same time}} simple in terms of costs of bureaucracy and does not tax economic growth more than necessary. ...|$|R
40|$|This article fills {{a gap in}} {{the legal}} {{literature}} by comparing mandatory corporate governance regimes to voluntary corporate governance regimes. It encourages market participants, including regulators, to acknowledge that firms have incentives to adopt enhanced governance practices voluntarily and to make disclosure about the same. The article argues that an optimal governance regime is a hybrid one in which adoption of best practice guidelines is voluntary but disclosure of corporate governance practices is <b>mandatory.</b> Such <b>a</b> regime is optimal because it balances the benefits and costs to all stakeholders, particularly issuers and investors. The cost analysis should be completed by weighing the level of expected compliance against the total costs of the regime adopted by regulators. <b>A</b> partially <b>mandatory</b> structure is likely to yield a high level of compliance with a defined set of governance practices at lower cost than <b>a</b> wholly <b>mandatory</b> regime. While <b>a</b> wholly <b>mandatory</b> structure may yield slightly better compliance, its costs are likely much higher. Thus, <b>a</b> partially <b>mandatory</b> structure that minimizes costs but encourages compliance is optimal...|$|R

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing to apply for <b>a</b> <b>mandatory</b> order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as <b>a</b> <b>mandatory</b> order) {{to ensure that the}} Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
