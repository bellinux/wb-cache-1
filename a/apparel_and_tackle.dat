40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 92 - 96) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role of knowledge in consumer willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile products. The objectives for this study were to understand how environmental concern, attitudes, and knowledge are related to consumer willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles, when knowledge being the main variable studied. The study aimed to determine whether education would be part of helping consumers become more knowledgeable with the issue of sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles. Lastly, it was designed to evaluate the differences between <b>Apparel</b> Design <b>and</b> Merchandising (ADM) students, who potentially have better knowledge of the issue in question, and Non-ADM students who represent the average consumer, and determine the two groups??? differences in willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile based on their knowledge. Data were collected using a survey of Family and Consumer Sciences??? students at California State University, Northridge. The research design included a pretest questionnaire examining all related issues, followed by an educational workshop on sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles, intended to enhance knowledge level among students, and a posttest questionnaire measuring the new level of knowledge and willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles. The relationship between knowledge and willingness to purchase was tested using correlation analysis. The differences in knowledge and willingness to purchase between the two groups were tested using t-test analysis. Repeated measure analysis was used to determine the interaction between students major and education workshop. The major findings of this study reveal (a) that the results rejected the hypothesis that ???there is no impact of environmental concern on students??? willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile products???, due to finding significant correlations between environmental concern and WTP. (b) The results rejected the hypothesis that ???there is no impact of attitudes on students??? willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile products???, due to finding significant correlations between attitudes and WTP. (c) The results failed to reject the hypothesis that ???there is no impact of knowledge on students??? willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile products???, as no significant correlation was found between knowledge and WTP scores. Findings of this study (d) rejected the hypothesis, ???education plays no role in improving students' knowledge of sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile???, as significantly increased knowledge scores were found over time, after completion of the educational workshop on sustainable apparel issues. Also (e), the hypothesis, ???there is no difference in knowledge levels between ADM students and Non-Major students before educational workshop??? was rejected. ADM students exhibited higher initial knowledge level. Results failed to reject (f) the hypothesis that ??? there is no difference in knowledge levels between ADM students and Non-Major students after educational workshop???. The gap in knowledge between the groups decreased after participating in the workshop. Results failed to reject (g) the final two hypotheses, ???there is no difference in willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles between ADM students and Non-Major students before educational workshop???, and ???there is no difference in willingness to purchase sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles between ADM students and Non-Major students after educational workshop???. WTP scores did not different based on students major or workshop...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze changes in {{undergraduate}} student knowledge of issues of sustainability relevant to the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles industry. Assessment occurred prior to and upon completion of a course that addressed topics specific to the global production <b>and</b> distribution of <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile goods. The study also examined modifications in students’ reported apparel purchasing behaviors. Design/methodology/approach – Participants included those in their third, fourth or fifth year of undergraduate education in the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile discipline at a higher education institution located in the Midwestern USA. All participants were enrolled in a course focused on globalization <b>and</b> the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile industry. Measures used to assess students’ knowledge of social and environmental sustainability issues related to the industry <b>and</b> their <b>apparel</b> purchasing behavior were included in the research instrument. Findings – Pre and post comparisons revealed significant changes in students’ knowledge of social and environmental issues relevant to the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile industry. However, the study found no significant adjustments in apparel purchasing behavior. Further, a post hoc analysis revealed no significant relationship between students’ knowledge and their reported purchasing behavior. Originality/value – Limited resources exist which examine methods for educating <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile students about sustainability issues, with even less research documented on assessing the effectiveness of these methods. The paper analyzes the contributions sustainability-focused curriculum can make in modifying the level of knowledge and purchasing behavior of students and recommends further strategies to yield possibly even greater results...|$|R
