5|$|On December 30, TCWC Nadi {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed about 860km (535mi), to the northeast of Pago Pago in American Samoa. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south-southeast and gradually developed further, before the NPMOC designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P. During January 1, TCWC Nadi {{reported that}} the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it William <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> near the Cook Island of Autitaki. During the next day William subsequently slowly accelerated <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> near too or over several other Cook Islands and intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone. Early on January 3, TCWC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10-minute wind speeds of 110km/h (70mph) <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> near or over the French Polynesian islands of Maria and Rimatara.|$|E
5|$|Jimena was {{the first}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to threaten Hawaii since Hurricane Daniel of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. However, the storm weakened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> south of the islands and the effects from Jimena were minimal; there were no reported fatalities or injuries from the storm.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{developed over}} the central Atlantic Ocean on August30 and ultimately affected Bermuda with heightened tides <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> to the east. Elsewhere, the hurricane had little impact, becoming extratropical on September5. After the third system, a series of four tropical depressions formed, but failed to become severe. The fourth hurricane brought devastation to Jamaica, Cuba, and portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially western parts of the Florida Panhandle. Overall, the storm left six deaths and inflicted at least $170,000 (1917USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 {{the comet}} {{developed into a}} spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets {{are very close to}} the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E

5|$|During its {{weakening}} stage, deep convection {{existed only}} in the northwestern quadrant of the circulation. On August 19, cold cloud tops reappeared, although this brief revival {{has been attributed to}} non-tropical baroclinic instability. At 1200 UTC, the depression was declared extratropical, and it continued northward until dissipating near California a day later. Moisture from the system persisted <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> through the state and the Pacific Northwest, ultimately merging with a larger extratropical cyclone involving the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{countries}} {{felt the}} effects of Hurricane Dean as its path through the Caribbean Sea claimed 42lives. The hurricane first brushed the Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> through {{the interior of the}} Caribbean its outer rain bands swept over the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, Adrian's cloud pattern {{became less}} symmetric, its eye became obscured, and its {{convection}} warmed as southeasterly wind shear increased and the storm passed over ocean temperatures near 77°F (25°C). The storm slowed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> near Socorro Island, {{all the while}} the continued unfavorable regime weakened Adrian and stripped it of its all convection. The system was reduced to an exposed swirl of clouds over the open East Pacific by late on June22.|$|E

5|$|Haiti and the Dominican Republic, {{which share}} {{the island of}} Hispaniola, were spared much of the hurricane's force, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> 170mi (270km) to their south. However, 15people were killed among the island's two nations. Heavy rain flooded the streets of Santo Domingo and rough surf pounded the coast. Rain also caused {{landslides}} in Haiti, destroying several hundred homes and forcing 5,154people into temporary shelters, and compromising the temperamental water system {{in the town of}} Bainet.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Humberto {{formed from}} an area of low {{pressure}} generated by Hurricane Gabrielle. The low formed into a tropical depression on September 21 while south of Bermuda, tracking northwest, and was named Tropical Storm Humberto the next day. It began moving north, and then northeast <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> Bermuda and strengthened into a hurricane. Humberto headed over the colder waters of the far north Atlantic Ocean, and dissipated quickly on September 27.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Janet {{skirted the}} ABC islands with strong winds <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> {{to the north}} from September24–25. In Aruba, gusts peaked at 50mph (80km/h), {{uprooting}} trees. However, damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant. In Bonaire, piers were destroyed, and the island's coastal boulevard was damaged. Beach facilities at Curaçao's Piscadera and Vaersen Bays suffered considerable damage. Quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged.|$|E

5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man patrol northward to locate the North Koreans. Near Poun, the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching. The platoon took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> with all its weapons. The North Koreans halted their advance, thinking they had encountered a major position, and held back until daylight. When they turned back, the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E
5|$|PAGASA issued {{their final}} {{advisory}} later on September 16. Peak intensity for Typhoon Luis {{as reported by}} PAGASA while it was in their area of responsibility was only 80knots (150km/h, 95mph). Shanshan made landfall on September 17 {{on the island of}} Kyūshū. The HKO issued their final track forecast on the weakening typhoon later that day <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> out of their area of responsibility, with the peak intensity while within HKO's area of responsibility set at 185km/h (115mph, 100kt).

5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} to northern South India <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> {{over the country}} and its remnants brought scattered rain to Gujarat over the following week. Over a period of four hours, heavy rain fell on Hyderabad and Secunderabad, destroying many houses in the two cities. About 130mm (5inches) of rain fell on Bombay as the system dissipated. The heavy rains claimed about 75 lives.|$|E
5|$|A Company was not {{significantly}} delayed by the German patrols it encountered later, although the presence of cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> through Oosterbeek. As they approached the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to cross it. A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by manoeuvering through the back gardens of the houses {{on either side of}} the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn's platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it fed into the town centre.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} {{existed in the}} central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression turned to the north and crossed Cuba. A burst of convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passed</b> through the area on November 2. It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on November 3. The system turned to the northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical low over northern Florida on November 4.|$|E
