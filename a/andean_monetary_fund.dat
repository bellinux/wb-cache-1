40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> policies {{are driven by}} the powerful states which intervene to align policy with their preferences. In particular, many {{have argued that the}} United States uses its position as the Fund’s largest shareholder to achieve its foreign policy objectives. As a result, a substantial volume of literature argues and presents evidence to support the claim that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> decisions faithfully reflect US interests. My findings extend these claims. Using a new dataset on the presence in International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> agreements of binding conditions, which cause the agreement to be suspended or terminated if they are not met, I demonstrate that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> agreements contain fewer binding conditions when a suspension of International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> lending plausibly would impose greater hardship on creditor country banks and exporters...|$|R

Political background and economic policy has been analysed for better understanding what exactly eventually led Argentina to bankruptcy. For pragmatic reasons, most attention is devoted to 1990 's that are most valuable for confirming the efficiency and motivation of the participation of the International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund.</b> Primary evaluation criteria in the thesis are inflation (based on consumer price index), growth of GDP, balance of payments and unemployment. All of the economic indicators are described on the historical background, as well as the political situation during the discussed period of time. Simultaneously, an effort to describe behaviour and development of the International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> is manifested in regards to its own motivation, which is consolidation of the government budget and establishing economic development. Last but not least, there is a note about a controversy, which surrounds the whole existence of institution like International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund,</b> his agency and role...|$|R
