Recent progress {{in the area of}} thermosetting materials, namely, the development of injection moulding compounds, has expanded their use and thus their production and processing.

50|$|Slip-casting methods provide {{superior}} surface quality, {{density and}} uniformity in casting high-purity ceramic raw materials over other ceramic casting techniques, such as hydraulic casting, since the cast part {{is a higher}} concentration of ceramic raw materials with little additives. A slip is a suspension of fine raw materials powder in a liquid such as water or alcohol with small amounts of secondary materials such as dispersants, surfactants and binders. Pottery slipcasting techniques employ a plaster block or flask mould. The plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> surface. This forms a dense cast removing deleterious air gaps and minimizing shrinkage in the final sintering process.|$|E
40|$|Mould filling processes, {{in which}} a {{material}} flow front advances through a mould, are typical examples of moving boundary problems. The moving boundary {{is accompanied by a}} moving contact line <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> walls causing, from a macroscopic modelling viewpoint, a stress singularity. In {{order to be able to}} simulate such processes, the moving boundary and moving contact line problem must be overcome. A numerical model for both two- and three-dimensional mould filling simulations has been developed. It employs a pseudo-concentration method in order to avoid elaborate three-dimensional remeshing, and has been implemented in a finite element program. The moving contact line problem has been overcome by employing a Robin boundary condition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> walls, which can be turned into a Dirichlet (no-slip) or a Neumann (free-slip) boundary condition depending on the local pseudo-concentration. Simulation results for two-dimensional test cases demonstrate the model’s ability to deal with flow phenomena such as fountain flow and flow in bifurcations. The method is by no means limited to two-dimensional flows, as is shown by a pilot simulation for a simple three-dimensional mould. The reverse problem of mould filling is the displacement of a viscous fluid in a tube by a less viscous fluid, which has had considerable attention since the 1960 ’s. Simulation results for this problem are in good agreement with results from the literature. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|International audienceA new {{approach}} to the modelling of grain structure formation in solidification processes is proposed. Based upon a two-dimensional cellular automata technique, the model includes the mechanisms of heterogeneous nucleation and of grain growth. Nucleation occurring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> wall {{as well as in}} the liquid metal are treated by using two distributions of nucleation sites. The location and the crystallographic orientation of the grains are chosen randomly among a large number of cells and a certain number of orientation classes, respectively. The growth kinetics of the dendrite tip and the preferential 〈 100 〉 growth directions of cubic metals are taken into account. The model is then applied to small specimens of uniform temperature. The columnar-to-equiaxed transition, the selection and extension of columnar grains which occur in the columnar zone and the impingement of equiaxed grains are clearly shown by this technique. The calculated effect of the alloy concentration and cooling rate upon the resultant microstructure agree with experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{the meaning of}} a {{migrating}} hot spot during solidification will be discussed. Initially, just after mould filling, global as well as local thermal centres, or hot spots, are established. This occurs at mass concentrations and heavy sections as the mould wall initially is at ambient temperature. However, these hot spots are found to be migrating during solidification. This migration influences any temperature measurement and subsequent thermal analysis, introducing uncertainties. It has also been found that common casting defects such as shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration can be associated with a migrating hot spot. In these cases the final position of the hot spot is located across the interface between the casting and the mould. The solidification starts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> walls and {{it was found that the}} columnar zone is affected by the migrating hot spot. The macrostructure was preserved using DAAS technique and it was revealed that an otherwise normal columnar zone because of the migrating hot spot had been affected.

40|$|Bra cup {{moulding}} {{is currently}} a remarkable process {{in the production of}} seamless intimate apparel. The process is highly complex, time-consuming and error-prone due to the large variations of foam and lamination properties, cup styles and sizes, and geometric features of graduated padding. In particular, the three-dimensional (3 D) geometric shape of foam cups is difficult to assess accurately because they are very soft and readily deform. In cases that involve fitting problems, shape modifications of <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> head and determination of <b>the</b> optimal <b>moulding</b> conditions have undergone repeated trials and errors. There is limited knowledge about the effects of foam properties and cup parameters in <b>the</b> controlling of <b>moulding</b> conditions. This study adopts a parameterization-based remesh algorithm method to evaluate the 3 D shapes of the convex surface of scanned cup samples. The shape conformity of the cup is quantified in accordance to <b>the</b> corresponding <b>mould</b> head. In this respect, <b>the</b> <b>moulding</b> conditions that would achieve the most desirable geometric shapes of bra cups can be accurately and objectively demonstrated. Based on moulding experiments with 6 types of polyurethane (PU) foam materials, empirical equations that associate the cup shape conformity and the shape deviations from selected cup sectional curves are established. Through the use of non-linear regression models, the shape conformity of <b>the</b> <b>moulded</b> cups can be predicted by moulding conditions with reasonable accuracy. The shape conformity provides effective guidelines for quality assurance and improves production efficiency of bra cup moulding. Moreover, thermal-mechanical properties, such as compressive strain and softening temperature obtained from thermomechanical analysis (TMA) scans, provide a good understanding of cup shape conformity and determine <b>the</b> lowest <b>moulding</b> temperature <b>at</b> initial trails of <b>the</b> bra cup <b>moulding</b> process. Surprisingly, in pliable foams, the cup size does not have an apparent effect on <b>the</b> <b>moulding</b> conditions to achieve optimal cup shape conformity. The results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>moulding</b> conditions for sizes 34 B and 34 D could remain the same for pliable foam materials. Nevertheless, in the case of more rigid foams, a higher moulding temperature is required to achieve a desirable cup shape for size 34 D as more energy is required for the heat-setting of foam materials with higher proportions of hard segments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moulding</b> of a larger cup size in anticipation of larger deformations.

40|$|For powder {{injection}} moulding (PIM) the ceramic powder {{is mixed with}} a thermoplastic binder system to achieve an injectable feedstock. In contrast to {{injection moulding}} of polymeric components, the binder must be removed after the shaping step before sintering the ceramic part to full density.

In this case polymer films form <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> surface and at internal interfaces which induce microstructural defects in the debinded part.

Since conventional machining techniques like grinding and polishing modify the original structure, e. g. when particles are {{pulled out of the}} matrix and binder smears onto the surface, a special ceramographic method for the preparation of cross-sections was applied. This approach bases on broad ion beam techniques and enables the simultaneous polishing of hard ceramic particles and soft polymer molecules without destroying the structure or producing a relief at the surface.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{point in the}} continuous steel casting process exists in the meniscus zone of the cooled mould, i. e. the region where the steel stream flowing out of the tundish nozzle starts to solidify, because of the sticking that occurs between the solid shell of steel and the mould. In this work a new system for the ultrasonic lubrication of the continuous steel casting is proposed and experimentally tested. The basic idea is to excite one of the mould natural vibration modes {{by means of a}} distributed ultrasonic source, composed of an array of power emitters, with each of them placed on an antinode of the mould. An experimental characterization of the vibrational behaviour of a square mould was first carried out. The most active resonance modes of the mould were detected with an effective experimental technique based on a simple impedance measurement, while the modal shape of the selected mode and hence the position of antinodes were obtained by means of interferometer measurements. A further experimental investigation was carried out by exciting mould vibrations with up to four piezoceramic disks placed on different sets of antinodes, and some positioning criteria to maximize the superposition effect were derived. Measurements obtained by exciting the mould with up to four Langevin-type power emitters, designed and manufactured to work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> selected resonance frequency, have shown that, by increasing the number of emitters, the ultrasonic power transmitted to the mould and, consequently, the maximum available displacement increases.

40|$|Today {{continuous}} casting {{is the state}} of the art in industrial casting processes. The casting powder used fulfill various tasks such as preventing air contact, absorbing non-metallic inclusions from liquid steel, providing lubrication between strand shell and mould wall and controlling heat transfer. The mould powder in contact with liquid steel surface forms a liquid slag layer. The jet of liquid steel from submerged entry nozzle is reflected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> wall forming a lower and upper flow pattern. The upper flow moves along the steel-slag interface and generates shear stress at the interface and waves. Viscosity-and density-differences between the two liquid phases leads under certain flow conditions to finger like protrusions. Reaching a critical flow velocity the protrusions can breakup and form slag droplets following the flow into the liquid steel-pool. These droplets can form finally non-metallic inclusions in steel material, cause defects in the final product and therefore should be avoided. Till now the physical mechanisms of slag entrainment are not completely understood. The interaction at the liquid-liquid interface was investigated using cold model study using a single-roller driven flow in oil-water systems with various silicon oil properties.

In this study, advanced converting tools (die cutting tools and the press forming mould) are created for production scale paperboard tray manufacturing. Also monitoring methods that enable the production of paperboard trays with enhanced quality, and can be utilized in process control are developed. The principles for tray blank preparation, including creasing pattern and die cutting tool design are introduced.

Foaming behaviour of HMSPP/ clay nanocomposites and HMS-PP/EVA/clay nanocomposite blends is studied using a batch and a continuous foam injection moulding system. Morphological studies using TEM and SEM led to a few interesting deductions. It {{is very difficult to}} attain complete exfoliation in case of HMS-PP/clay nanocomposites even at low clay loadings due to a non polar nature and low graft efficiencies of HMS-PP matrix. The addition of clay to an immiscible blend of HMS-PP/EVA results in compatibilization between the dispersed and the continuous phase. Nanocellular foams (290 nm) were subsequently generated in the batch process at a foaming temperature of 147 oC and 25 seconds foaming time. The addition of immiscible EVA- 28 to the HMS-PP matrix in presence of clay particles further results in reduction of foam cell sizes to 100 nm. The effect of gas concentration, foaming temperature, injection pressure, and foaming time on foam cell size was studied. It was found that the foam cell size was highly sensitive to the injection pressure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> gate (hence pressure drop rate) and foaming temperature. The cell size linearly decreased with increase in gas concentration and foaming time. The sensitivity of foam cell sizes to changes in processing parameters decreases with increase in clay concentration.

40|$|A novel {{computer}} {{model of the}} evolution of columnar and equiaxed microstructure during alloy solidification has been developed. A control volume finite difference model of conduction heat transfer is applied to a two-dimensional domain bounded by a relatively cold mould. The initial condition is that of superheated liquid, and nucleation occurs either <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> wall, leading to columnar dendritic growth, or within the bulk liquid, leading to the growth of equiaxed dendrites. The columnar front or the equiaxed grain boundaries are represented by computationally sharp interfaces, which separate liquid from partially solid alloy. Interpolation between discrete computational markers is employed to describe these interfaces, and a front-tracking technique is used to predict the evolution of the grain structure, via movement of the markers, across the fixed grid. The front velocity is determined via considerations of the kinetics of dendrite growth. The heat equation is fully coupled to the front-tracking algorithm by means of source terms which represent the evolution of latent heat due to the dendritic growth (advancing tips and thickening mushy zone). The model, applied to binary Al-Cu alloys, is computationally efficient. It predicts the variation of the extent of liquid undercooling ahead of the growing columnar front, and new metrics have been established to determine the likelihood of the formation of an equiaxed zone here. The employment of these metrics to establish the influence of heat extraction rate and alloy composition agrees with reports from the literature. The model does not distinguish between individual grains of the columnar zone, but it is shown that this is not an important limitation for most metal casting applications. Direct simulation of the nucleation and growth of multiple equiaxed crystals has been carried out, in which the nucleation and growth of individual grams can be observed via animation, and the influence of melt superheat and heat extraction rate on equiaxed solidification has been determined. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of metal expansion penetration of {{grey cast iron}} components is dependent on both solidification anomalies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> metal – <b>mould</b> interface and <b>the</b> inclination of <b>the</b> sand <b>mould</b> to permit <b>the</b> metal liquid to penetrate between the sand grains. The present work utilizes the latest development of primary austenite inoculation in combination with classic eutectic inoculation to limit the metallurgical contribution to metal expansion penetration. A solid shell containing the primary austenite dendrite network constitutes the barrier between the liquid metal and mould interface. Inoculants of both the primaryand eutectic phase control the permeability of the dendrite network...|$|R
