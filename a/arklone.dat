5000|$|Runcorn (in Cheshire): ICI {{operated}} {{a number of}} separate sites within the Runcorn area, including Caster-Kellner site, where ICI manufactured chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda). Adjacent to Castner-Kellner site was Rocksavage works, where a variety of chemicals based on chlorine products were manufactured, including Chloromethanes, <b>Arklone</b> dry cleaning fluid, Trichloethylene degreasing fluid and the Arcton range of CFCs. Also on that site were PVC manufacture and HF (Hydrogen fluoride) manufacture. At Runcorn Heath Research Laboratories, technical support, research and development for Mond Division products was carried out, and the support sections included chemical plan design and engineering sections. Just {{to the north of}} Runcorn, on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey could be found the Wigg Works, which had been erected originally for producing poison gas in wartime. In Widnes could also be found several factories producing weedkillers and other products. For many years it was known as ICI Mond Division but later became part of the ICI Chemicals and Polymers Division. The Runcorn site was also responsible {{for the development of the}} HiGEE and Spinning Disc Reactor concepts. These were originated by Professor Colin Ramshaw and led to the concept of Process Intensification; research into these novel technologies is now being pursued by the Process Intensification Group at Newcastle University.|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes {{hepatitis}} A, {{a severe}} food and waterborne disease that is primarily transmitted by the faecal/oral route. It {{is the only}} notifiable foodborne viral disease. It is a singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family and now classified in a distinct genus, Hepatovirus. HAV has a single serotype. Seven genotypes, four of which are found in humans, have been identified. These genotypes can be useful for tracing outbreak sources. GROWTH AND ITS CONTROL Growth: Hepatitis A virus is culturable in primate cell lines but wild type strains are difficult to culture and generally do not produce cell changes so {{are not easy to}} identify by culture alone. It will not grow in food or water. Survival: HAV is very stable, shows high resistance to chemical and physical agents such as heat, acid and solvents and has been shown to survive in the environment for over 3 months. Inactivation: Temperature: HAV integrity and infectivity were retained after 60 min incubation at 60 °C and the virus was only partially inactivated after 10 - 12 hours at 56 °C. Infectivity was retained after 10 min at 80 °C in 1 M MgCl 2 but for only 5 min in phosphate buffered saline. HAV heat resistance is reported to be greater in foods and shellfish. HAV inoculated into oysters was not fully inactivated after heating in a can for 19 min at 60 °C. MAFF UK recommend a heat treatment of 1. 5 min at 90 o C to inactivate HAV in cockles Under refrigeration and freezing conditions the virus remains intact and infectious for several years. pH: Stable at acid pH. At pH 1. 0 and 25 °C, HAV retained high infectivity after 2 hours and was still infectious after 5 hours. Drying: Infectious for> 1 month at 25 °C and 42 % humidity. Greater resistance to inactivation at low humidity and temperatures. Sanitisers/Disinfectants: (These products must be used as advised by the manufacturer). Infectivity is decreased by exposure to 70 % alcohol. Resistant to chloroform, Freon, <b>Arklone</b> and 20 % ether. Not inactivated by 300 mg/l perchloroacetic acid or 1 g/l chloramine at 20 °C for 15 min. HAV is inactivated by: Chlorine: 99. 99 % reduction in 6. 5 min at pH 6 and 49. 6 min at pH 10 (estimated Ct values under conditions described are 1. 8 and 12. 3 respectively...|$|E
