5|$|The Field Spaniel can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family</b> dog {{while it}} has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like {{to stay close to}} their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E

Around 1905, Coffin set up her own office at the National Arts Club and began taking commissions, using her family {{connections}} to find work.

Coffin was well-connected in such circles, widely traveled, came from <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family,</b> was professionally trained and was known for her good taste.

5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), {{as he and}} his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family.</b> At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E

In particular, the presiding judge caused outrage {{when he said}} in his judgment that Bokhary had an [...] "unblemished background and was born into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family</b> with caring parents [...] an outstanding academic record". The comment highlighted the public perception of widening inequality and increasing disparities in the balance of political power between different social classes in Hong Kong. The judge came under pressure to reconsider his sentencing, but he declined to amend it upon review. Pundits also blamed the police for charging her with an offence carrying a lesser penalty; the Department of Justice was forced to appeal her sentence.|$|E

He {{is often referred to}} as a Boston Brahmin, a term that he created while referring to the oldest families in the Boston area. The term, as he used it, referred not only to members of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family</b> but also implied intellectualism.

500|$|Further {{on in the}} saga, it is {{stated that}} Sveinn's brother, Gunni Óláfsson, had {{children}} with Margrét Hákonardóttir, mother of Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney, Mormaer of Caithness. Because of this relationship with his mother, Haraldr banished Gunni from the earldom, and enmity arose between Sveinn and the earl. Sveinn then sent Gunni to stay with Ljótólfr on Lewis, with whom Sveinn himself had stayed at an earlier time. The saga also states that at this time, Ljótólfr's son, Fugl, was with Haraldr, and consequently there was a [...] "coldness" [...] between Fugl and Sveinn. The saga relates that Sveinn stole a ship from Fugl, who had been travelling to Orkney to meet Haraldr. However, subsequently a relation of Fugl's, named Anakol, who became a friend of Sveinn, succeeded in making peace between the two. Historian Garreth Williams noted that Anakol's name is Gaelic in origin, and like Ljótólfr and Fugl, he is described as being originally from the Hebrides. The saga also states that he was from <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
500|$|Scheduled {{to appear}} in Eastern Magistrates' Court on 7 April, Acting Principal Magistrate Bina Chainrai recused herself due to her {{familiarity}} with Bokhary; the defence was granted a further delay, to permit preparation of a medical assessment. She pleaded guilty on 7 July, advancing mental illness in mitigation. On 2 August, she was sentenced to 12 months' probation and a fine of HK$8,000; her driving licence was suspended for 12 months. As a condition of her probation, she would also enter a treatment programme at the Betty Ford Center in the United States. Passing sentence, magistrate Anthony Yuen Wai-ming stated that her offences would normally result in prison time, but he decided to be lenient because of her mental disorder. Yuen's comment in his judgment that Bokhary has an [...] "unblemished background and was born into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family</b> with caring parents [...] an outstanding academic record" [...] caused an uproar locally. Her resulting probation was criticised in certain quarters, notably by the police, for its leniency. Between 6 and 7 August, Magistrate Yuen reviewed the case, but did not change his ruling.|$|E
500|$|Charges were {{initially}} laid against Webster for sexual assault, though {{by the time}} the case went to trial they had been dropped without public explanation. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, stated it was likely that Webster was offered a plea bargain that would drop the lesser charges in exchange for his guilty plea for murder. Webster pleaded guilty to Leigh's murder on 24 October 1990. The guilty plea meant that no witnesses were called for the trial; Detective Chaffey instead read a list of facts to the court. Justice James Roland Wood sentenced Webster to a minimum of 14 years in prison, with an additional six years during which he would be eligible for parole, saying that a life sentence was inappropriate in view of Webster's potential to be rehabilitated. Wood found that Webster's motivation for killing Leigh was his fear she would report his sexual assault. Five Stockton citizens volunteered to give character evidence at his trial, describing the [...] teenager as a quiet [...] "gentle giant" [...] from <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family.</b> Others expressed amazement at this description of Webster, who was also known as [...] "fat Matt, the thug of Stockton". Webster served his sentence at Parklea Correctional Centre.|$|E

It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, loved the episode. They described it as [...] "A brilliant episode, underlining everything that The Simpsons is about. Homer hates church, Marge wants the kids to see Homer as an example, and everyone pulls together in the end. Good stuff, and if God really is like that, he's a groovy kind of guy." [...] In 2012, HitFix's Alan Sepinwall cited the episode as his favorite of the show, writing that it [...] "captures everything that was and is great about the series: social satire, extraordinary quotability ('This Things I Believe'), <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family</b> story, and an innate sweetness in spite of Homer's outsized antics." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com released a list of the Top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking Benjamin Franklin and Jimi Hendrix's air hockey game, a scene from the episode, at #83.

Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House.

[...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>family</b> man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to.
