His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who {{has the ability to}} physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 2014, {{she became}} the {{youngest}} (age 11) {{to qualify for the}} U.S. Women's Open, surpassing Thompson's record (12 years, 4 months, 18 days) from the 2007 Open. Notably, Li not only qualified, but she won her qualifying event by seven strokes at Old Course at Half Moon Bay Golf Links. Thompson missed the cut in 2007 with a 36-hole 168 total. Li was the second-youngest to compete; nine years prior to the introduction of qualification in 1976, Beverly Klass played in the 1967 Open at age 10 years, 7 months, and 21 days. Although Li's qualification was largely heralded, some were befuddled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the sport when a sixth grader could even qualify {{for one of the most}} prestigious events of the year. Li, who had reached a 1.5 handicap by April, had a handicap better than threshold 2.4, making her eligible to participate in qualifications.|$|E

25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E

[...] Year Zero was mixed in January 2007, and Reznor stated on his blog that the album was finished as of February 5. The album's budget was a reported US$2million, but since Reznor composed most of the album himself on his laptop and in his home-studio, much of the budget instead went toward the extensive accompanying promotional campaign.|$|E

500|$|Some of the {{material}} from the 1901 census was later republished, in amended form, in Risley's 1908 work, The People of India, which sociologist D. F. Pocock describes as [...] "almost the last production of that great tradition of administrator scholars who had long and extensive experience in the Indian Civil Service and had not found their arduous activity incompatible with scholarship." [...] Trautmann considers the census report and subsequent book to represent [...] "Risley's grand syntheses of India ethnology", while the paper of 1891 had given [...] "an exceptionally clear view of his project <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> {{what we might call}} its early maturity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scientist}} Michael Faraday {{described the}} situation {{in a letter to}} The Times in July 1855: shocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the Thames, he dropped pieces of white paper into the river to [...] "test the degree of opacity". His conclusion was that [...] "Near the bridges the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface, even in water of this kind.... The smell was very bad, and common to the whole of the water; it was the same as that which now comes up from the gully-holes in the streets; the whole river was for the time a real sewer." [...] The smell from the river was so bad that in 1857 the government poured chalk lime, chloride of lime and carbolic acid into the waterway to ease the stench.|$|E
500|$|... "Runaway Daydreamer", as {{with the}} rest of Wanderlust, was co-written by its {{producer}} Ed Harcourt along with Ellis-Bextor. [...] It was recorded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> the Ark studios, mixed and engineered by Richard Woodcruft, and mastered by Miles Showell. It is a chamber pop track which includes string arrangements and [...] "shuffled percussion". Clare Considine of Time Out compared its sonority to that of a Humphrey Bogart movie soundtrack. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the track as a [...] "girl group homage". Davidf Farrell of PopMatters opined that the song and [...] "Until the Stars Collide" [...] set a [...] "soaring, dreamy" [...] atmosphere for Wanderlust. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song contains 116 beats per minute in crotchet. Its introduction follows a chord progression of C—F/C—C—F/C—C—F/C—C—F, and transitions into the verse section in which the notes C–F–C are followed. The track is composed in the traditional verse–chorus form. Ellis-Bextor's vocals during the song incorporate the melisma technique and span from G to E.|$|E

500|$|On March 4, 2010, the Chemetco {{site was}} added to the Superfund National Priorities List because of the lead, cadmium and zinc {{contamination}} at the site and of nearby wetlands and Long Lake. [...] The lack of available resources at the bankrupt Chemetco or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Illinois necessitated proposal of this site to the National Priorities List (NPL). [...] This will enable the use of Federal funds to build a CERCLA enforcement case and ensure clean up the site. [...] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will oversee the clean up of the site and affected areas. [...] After the site was listed on the NPL, U.S. EPA, with the support of Illinois EPA, began the search for potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for the clean up. [...] In November 2011, U.S. EPA issued a General Notice of potential liability to a group of PRPs, and is currently working with a subgroup of them. [...] U.S. EPA plans to negotiate a settlement with PRPs for performance of the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the site, which will define {{the nature and extent of}} contamination associated with the site and present options for the long-term remediation of affected areas. [...] Upon completion of the RI/FS Report, U.S. EPA will select a remedy for the site, with input from the community and stakeholders.|$|E
500|$|Parry was {{concerned}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> his label's top band, and {{became convinced that}} the solution was for the Cure to reinvent its musical style. Parry managed to convince Smith and Tolhurst of the idea; Parry said, [...] "It appealed to Robert {{because he wanted to}} destroy the Cure anyway." [...] With Tolhurst now playing keyboards instead of drums, the duo released the single [...] "Let's Go to Bed" [...] in late 1982. While Smith wrote the single as a throwaway, [...] "stupid" [...] pop song to the press, it became a minor hit in the UK, reaching number 44 on the singles chart, but entered the Top 20 in Australia and New Zealand. It was followed in 1983 by two more successful songs: the synthesiser-based [...] "The Walk" [...] (number 12), and [...] "The Love Cats", which became the band's first British Top 10 hit, reaching number seven. The group released these studio singles and their B-sides as the compilation album Japanese Whispers, designed by Smith for the Japanese market only, but released worldwide on the decision of the record company. The same year, Smith also recorded and toured with Siouxsie and the Banshees, contributing as guitarist on their Nocturne live album and video and their Hyæna studio album. Meanwhile, he recorded the Blue Sunshine album with Banshees bassist Steven Severin as the Glove, while Lol Tolhurst produced the first two singles and debut album of the English band And Also the Trees.|$|E

In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials.|$|E
2500|$|The Radical {{movement}} had its beginnings {{at a time}} of tension between the American colonies and Great Britain, with the first Radicals, angry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the House of Commons, drawing on the Leveller tradition and similarly demanding improved parliamentary representation. These earlier concepts of democratic and even egalitarian reform had emerged in the turmoil of the English Civil War and the brief establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England amongst the vague political grouping known as the Levellers, but with the English Restoration of the monarchy such ideas had been discredited. Although the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had increased parliamentary power with a constitutional monarchy and the union of the parliaments brought England and Scotland together, {{towards the end of the}} 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over the Parliament of Great Britain which itself was dominated by the English aristocracy and by patronage. Candidates for the House of Commons stood as Whigs or Tories, but once elected formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than splitting along party lines. At general elections the vote was restricted to property owners, in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in many rotten borough seats could be bought or were controlled by rich landowners, while major cities remained unrepresented. Discontent with these inequities inspired those individuals who later became known as the [...] "Radical Whigs".|$|E
