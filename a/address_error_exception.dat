We study {{the results of the}} analysis of three well-known programs, classifying exceptions as assertion failures, <b>error</b> <b>exceptions,</b> control-flow exceptions, and pervasive exceptions. Even though the analysis is often conservative and reports many spurious exceptions, we have found it useful for checking the consistency of <b>error</b> and control-flow <b>exceptions.</b> Furthermore, using our tools, we have uncovered two minor exception-related bugs in the three programs we scrutinized. 1 Introduction The ML type system guarantees that ML programs never terminate abnormally.

System availability can be improved despite software errors by fast error detection and recovery techniques that minimize total downtime after an outage. This dissertation analyzes software errors in three commercial systems and describes the implementation and evaluation of several techniques for early error detection and fast recovery in a database management system (DBMS). The software error study examines errors reported by customers in three IBM systems programs: the MVS operating system and the IMS DBMS and DB 2 DBMS. The study classifies errors by the type of coding mistake and the circumstances in the customer's environment that caused the error to arise. It observes a higher availability impact from <b>addressing</b> <b>errors,</b> such as uninitialized pointers, than software errors as a whole. It also details the frequencies and types of <b>addressing</b> <b>errors</b> and characterizes the damage they do. The error detec [...] ...|$|R

In this thesis we present evidence that email management can be potentially improved by the {{effective use of}} machine learning techniques to model different aspects of user intention.

We then describe how machine learning can be used to reduce the chances of costly email <b>addressing</b> <b>errors.</b> One type of costly error is an “email leak”, i. e., mistakenly sending a message to an unintended recipient — a widespread problem that can severely harm individuals and corporations. Another type of <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> is forgetting to add an intended collaborator as recipient, a likely source of costly misunderstandings and communication delays that can be potentially addressed with intelligent recipient recommendation. We propose several different approaches to address these problems, and show ver...|$|R
