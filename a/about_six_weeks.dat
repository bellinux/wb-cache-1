5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} are polygynous. The {{breeding}} season takes place throughout the year, excluding the fall, but peaks during April and May. Shark attacks cause a high pup mortality, from 19% to 39%. It {{is thought that}} pups are weaned at <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks,</b> and are thought to reach sexual maturity at three years Their average lifespan is 25 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Fruiting begins <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> {{after the}} initial {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow {{very close to the}} initial site of inoculation—within 3mm—and take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{can take}} place {{at any time of}} year, but mostly during the wet season. Four to eight young are born, {{sometimes}} as many as 12 in southern populations; the young spend <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> in the backward-facing pouch, and then <b>about</b> another <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> hidden in a grassy nest under bark or other vegetation while the mother forages each night.|$|R

5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. Painting the mural took <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks,</b> and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, Emery {{was placed}} on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally {{expected}} to miss <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks,</b> the prognosis changed when {{it was discovered that}} he had avascular necrosis. In March 2010, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren announced that Emery would be out for remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues.|$|E
5|$|Einstein was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live and work, and equally worried {{about the fate of}} countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E

5|$|General Sheridan now led an 8,000-man force, and it {{consisted}} of two cavalry divisions. General Wesley Merritt was Sheridan's cavalry commander. General Thomas Devin led the 1st Division, and the 3rd Division was commanded by George Armstrong Custer, who was now a general. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{became part of the}} 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division Cavalry Corps. The brigade consisted of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd West Virginia Cavalry regiments, and was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The divisions spent <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> in winter quarters, where they rested and were given fresh clothing. On February 27, they left Winchester and moved south. Their purpose was to eliminate Jubal Early's Confederate army.|$|E
5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5000|$|Clinicians {{prescribe}} zolpidem {{for short-term}} (usually <b>about</b> two to <b>six</b> <b>weeks)</b> treatment of insomnia. Zolpidem addresses sleep-initiation problems, {{but is not}} effective in maintaining sleep. Also, a 2012 NIH study showed that zolpidem's effectiveness is nearly as much due to psychological effects as to the drug itself, so [...] "increased attention should be directed at psychological intervention of insomnia." ...|$|R
50|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year, with females {{giving birth to}} up to four young after a gestation period of between 39 and 46 days. At birth, the young are hairless and blind, weighing just 2 to 3 g. They are weaned at about 25 days, and reach full adult size after <b>about</b> <b>six</b> or seven <b>weeks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Strabismus surgery {{attempts}} to align the eyes by shortening, lengthening, or changing {{the position of}} {{one or more of the}} extraocular eye muscles. The procedure can typically be performed in about an hour, and requires <b>about</b> <b>six</b> to eight <b>weeks</b> for recovery. Adjustable sutures may be used to permit refinement of the eye alignment in the early postoperative period.|$|R
5|$|Starr and {{his wife}} left on 1 March, after a ten-day stay; McCartney left after one month due to other commitments; Lennon and Harrison stayed <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks,</b> then left {{abruptly}} following financial disagreements and rumours of inappropriate behaviour by the Maharishi. Harrison later apologised for {{the way that he}} and Lennon had treated the Maharishi, and he gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for the teaching of Transcendental Meditation to at-risk students.|$|E
5|$|The twenty-seven story Rand Tower, {{built in}} 1929, {{was the next}} major {{challenger}} to the height limit. The thirty-two story Foshay Tower, also built in 1929, was the highest building in Minneapolis until 1971. Its builder, Wilbur Foshay, wanted a tower built {{along the lines of}} the Washington Monument. He staged a lavish dedication ceremony complete with a march composed by John Philip Sousa. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> later, Foshay lost his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Foshay's $20,000 check to Sousa bounced, and Sousa forbade anyone else to play the march until the debt was repaid.|$|E
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> before giving birth, so shepherds often {{rely on the}} assumption that a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
40|$|A {{descriptive}} and explanatory {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of external collaboration script and cultural diversity on the learning processes and online collaborative behavior in computer-mediated communication (CMC). For this purpose, an experimental 2 x 2 -factorial design was established with the external collaboration script (with vs. without) and group composition with respect to Hofstede's individualist-collectivist cultural dimension (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) as independent variables. Culturally heterogeneous and homogeneous dyads were assigned to one of the two conditions (with and without external collaboration script). In total sixty five dyads of students (N= 130) worked collaboratively on a learning task in the field of intercultural communication for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>week</b> time in CMC learning environment. Two already existing coding schemes were utilized to analyze the transcripts in terms of the students’ learning processes and their online collaborative behaviors in CMC. The results suggest that students' cultural background (the individualist-collectivist dimension) affects their learning processes and online collaborative behavior in CMC. In addition, the results showed the positive effects of the introduced script for culturally heterogeneous student dyads on the following online collaborative behavior variables: contributing, seeking input, and social interaction...|$|R

5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E
5|$|Lord Guildford Dudley (also spelt Guilford) (c.1535 – 12 February 1554) was {{the husband}} of Lady Jane Grey who, {{declared}} as his heir by King Edward VI, occupied the English throne from 10July until 19July 1553. Guildford Dudley enjoyed a humanist education and was married to Jane in a magnificent celebration <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> before the King's death. After Guildford's father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane's accession, Jane and Guildford spent her brief rule residing in the Tower of London. They {{were still in the}} Tower when their regime collapsed and they remained there, in different quarters, as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt's rebellion against her plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple's execution, a measure that was widely seen as unduly harsh.|$|E

5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|The German–Yugoslav Partisan {{negotiations}} were held between German {{commanders in the}} Independent State of Croatia and the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans in March 1943 during World War II. The negotiations – focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange – were conducted during the Axis Case White offensive. They were used by the Partisans to delay the Axis forces while the Partisans crossed the Neretva river, and to allow the Partisans to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Draža Mihailović. The {{negotiations were}} accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> before being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by the Partisans through the negotiations was lost when the Axis Case Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943. Prisoner exchanges, which had been occurring between the Germans and Partisans for some months prior, re-commenced in late 1943 and continued {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
