25|$|The islands {{form the}} Macaronesia {{ecoregion}} with the Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira, and the Savage Isles. The Canary Islands {{is the largest}} and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region. The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin. The Teide volcano on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic oceanic crust associated {{with the opening of the}} Atlantic. Underwater magmatism commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the Miocene. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the Atlas Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger African <b>Alpine</b> <b>System</b> division.|$|E

50|$|Lowepro camera bags {{began as}} an {{offshoot}} of Lowe <b>Alpine</b> <b>Systems,</b> an outdoor equipment manufacturer founded by Mike, Greg and Jeff Lowe in suburban Denver (Colorado) in 1967. In the 1960s, the Lowe brothers were known in outdoor circles for their climbing, skiing and photography. In 1967, Greg Lowe invented the world’s first close-fitting internal-frame backpack. He used the same design principles to create the Lowepro line of protective camera bags as he often carried photographic equipment on hikes and climbs in the backcountry of the Western United States. The first bag marketed for cameras was manufactured in 1972.|$|R

50|$|Climate change also poses {{a threat}} to the high <b>alpine</b> <b>systems,</b> and this zone could {{disappear}} in many areas. Local extinctions of alpine species such as arctic gentian, alpine chaenactis, rosy finch, and water pipit could be expected as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Even a modest warming and drying could reduce whitebark pine habitat by up to 90% within 50 years. Whitebark pine nuts and army cutworm moth caterpillars, which are found in these forests, provide vital food for Wyoming’s grizzly bear population. Whitebark pine forest may be replaced with Douglas fir, and on the lower slopes, forest would give way to treeless landscapes dominated by big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.|$|R

50|$|Most of its {{territory}} lies within the Great European Plain, while parts of western regions and southern regions lay within the <b>Alpine</b> <b>system.</b> In general Ukraine comprises two different biomes: mixed forest towards {{the middle of}} continent and steppe towards the Black Sea littoral. Major provinces include, Polesian Lowland, Dnieper Lowland, Volhynia-Podolie Plateau, Black Sea-Azov Lowland, Donets-Azov Plateau, Central Russian Upland, Carpathians, and Pannonian Basin.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also not}} {{possible}} to define the Alps geologically, since the same orogenous events that created the Alps also created neighbouring ranges such as the Carpathians. See also Geology of the Alps. The Alps are a distinct physiographic province of the larger <b>Alpine</b> <b>System</b> physiographic division, but the Alps are composed of three distinct physiographic sections, the Eastern, Western and Southern Alps physiographic sections.|$|E

30|$|The tectonic {{evolution}} of northern Sinai indicates that Late Triassic–Liassic rifting formed east to east-northeast-oriented normal faults, which were reactivated during {{the closure of}} the Tethys by right-lateral transpression. Such structural inversion of old structures is probably similar to the deformation of the Atlas Mountains. The high and middle Atlas Mountains were formed by the inversion of an earlier Triassic rift structure in Late Cretaceous–Early Tertiary time (Stets and Wurster 1982). This deformation was related to {{the closure of the}} Tethys. Laubscher and Bernoulli (1977, 1978) examine the compressive movements of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>systems</b> that are accompanied by dextral movements. This adds further evidence to the right-lateral transpression in the northern Sinai, which was certainly related to the Alpine deformation.|$|R
40|$|Climate warming {{strongly}} influences reproductive phenology {{of plants}} in alpine and Arctic ecosystems. Here, {{we focus on}} phenological shifts caused by experimental warming in a typical alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Under soil water stress caused by warming, most plants in the alpine meadow advanced or delayed their reproductive events to be aligned with the timing of peak rainfall. As a result, warming significantly increased the temporal overlap among reproductive stages of early- and late-flowering species. In addition, we found that some species, for example the late-flowering species, were unable to produce flowers and fruits under warming with failed monsoon rains. The potentially warmer- and drier-growing seasons under climate change may similarly shift the phenological patterns and change species composition of these <b>alpine</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Tell Atlas runs {{parallel}} to the Mediterranean coast. Together with the Saharan Atlas to the south it forms the northernmost of two more or less parallel ranges which approach one another towards the east, remaining quite distinct from one another in Western Algeria and merging in Eastern Algeria. At the western end, it ends at the Rif and Middle Atlas ranges in Morocco. The Tell Atlas are also a distinct physiographic section of the larger Atlas Mountains province, {{which in turn is}} part of the larger African <b>Alpine</b> <b>System</b> physiographic division.|$|E
50|$|The Alpine orogeny {{occurred}} in ongoing cycles {{through to the}} Paleogene causing differences in nappe structures, with a late-stage orogeny causing {{the development of the}} Jura Mountains. A series of tectonic events in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods caused different paleogeographic regions. The Alps are subdivided by different lithology (rock composition) and nappe structure according to the orogenic events that affected them. The geological subdivision differentiates the Western, Eastern Alps and Southern Alps: the Helveticum in the north, the Penninicum and Austroalpine system in the centre and, south of the Periadriatic Seam, the Southern <b>Alpine</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Apennines {{were created}} in the Apennine orogeny {{beginning}} in the early Neogene (about 20 mya, the middle Miocene) and continuing today. Geographically they are partially or appear to be continuous with the <b>Alpine</b> <b>system.</b> Prior to the explosion of data on the topic from about the year 2000 many authors took the approach that the Apennines had the same origin as the Alps. Even today some authors use the term Alpine-Apennine system. They are not, however, the same system and did not have the same origin. The Alps were millions of years old before the Apennines rose from the sea.|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} main Eo-Alpine orogenic movement, {{the area}} of Western Carpathians was still not so mountainous. In the Paleogene {{subsidence}} along the normal faults caused formation of grabens - intra-mountain Inner Carpathian Paleogene Basin and horsts present day mountain ranges. In the Neogene, further orogene movement in the external part of Carpathian arc caused formation of back-arc Pannonian Basin. Northern branches of Pannonian Basin were penetrating the Tatra-Fatra Area and formed inter-mountain basins. Simultaneously with the immersion of the horsts, ongoing and intense erosion is denuding the mountains and supplies the basin with clastic sediments. Among all of the rocks, the most erosion resistant were the crystalline schists and granites of the Tatric. Similar fold and thrust model of origin is known from the other areas of <b>alpine</b> <b>system.</b> In the English terminology, similar model is called Fault-block mountain, it is typical {{in the area of}} Basin and Range.|$|E

40|$|Treelines {{are one of}} the few {{fundamental}} {{borders in}} ecology, separating forests from treeless <b>alpine</b> <b>systems.</b> Their physiological implications have been widely investigated, however their implications on global patterns are rarely analyzed. Treeline elevation has been described to be positively influenced by both mass elevation effect (MEE) and continentality. MEE decreases cloudiness and increases local air temperatures in the interior of large mountain chains, while continenatility (distance to ocean) increases temperatures during the growing season. Comprehensive quantifications of both MEE and continentaility are missing. Leuschner (1996) proposed treeline elevation to decrease with isolation on islands. How isolation influences treeline elevation in general, is currently unknown. We hypothesized that globally treeline elevations i) increase with increasing MEE, ii) increase with increasing continentality and iii) decrease with increasing isolation (by decreasing probability that a high elevation-adapted tree species occur) ...|$|R
