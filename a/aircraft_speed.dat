5|$|The Firebrand {{required}} significant {{effort by}} Blackburn {{to produce a}} useful aircraft and the first discussions on a redesign of the aircraft with a laminar-flow wing took place in September 1943. The new wing was estimated to reduce {{the weight of the}} wing by 700lb (318kg) and increase the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> by 13mph (21km/h). The extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements. In October 1943, Blackburn's design staff, led by G.E. Petty, started work on this development of the Firebrand which led to Specification S.28/43 being issued by the Air Ministry on 26 February 1944 covering the new aircraft. The specification was designed around a Bristol Centaurus 77 radial engine with contra-rotating propellers that allowed the size of the rudder to be reduced.|$|E
5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} strong {{headwinds}} on an <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>speed</b> during approach results in decreasing landing rates, generating delays and cancellations at airports {{with a significant}} cost to airspace users and the travelling public.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{specific}} pilot certification required. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>speeds</b> must be below 200 knots (230 mph) {{at or below}} 2500 ft above the ground, and within 4 nmi km of the class C airport.|$|R
2500|$|As <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> increased, {{designers}} {{began to}} encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near {{or greater than}} the speed of sound. [...] The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to shock waves, and the threat of structural failure due to aeroelastic flutter. [...] The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave, while Jakob Ackeret led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947 using the Bell X-1 aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jerzy Zięborak {{revisited}} {{the evidence}} {{gathered by the}} Court of Inquiry in 1943 {{as well as other}} material that has been made available to date. His conclusion was that the accident resulted from the combination of factors. Firstly, the aircraft was overloaded and its centre of gravity was displaced beyond the permissible limit. Secondly, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> at take-off was too low due to the excessive weight. Finally, the autopilot was switched on just after the take-off – contrary to the flight manual – and that caused an effect similar to the controls' jamming as seen by the second pilot. Evidence has been found that the surviving pilot Eduard Prchal did actually perform the second pilot's duties during the take-off, which he did not reveal {{at the time of the}} investigation. Jerzy Zięborak rejects General MacFarlane's opinion that Prchal's [...] during the take-off was the reason for the accident. He then compares Prchal's article written ten years after the accident with the relevant documents from the accident. It turns out that not only did Prchal write an untrue description of the accident, but he forgot some details he had earlier mentioned during his meetings with pilots. The differences included even the kinds of his own injury mentioned in the article and those reported in the medical examination after the accident. The author asks whether it was possible that Prchal had completely forgotten such details of the accident as for example the number of victims. The reason for these differences, i.e. whether Prchal lied deliberately in his article or suffered from a kind of partial amnesia as a result of his injury is not discussed. However, Jerzy Zięborak thinks that Prchal lied on purpose about the Mae West lifejacket.|$|E
50|$|When {{the rotor}} blade is {{perpendicular}} to the aircraft and advancing, its tip airspeed Vt is the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> plus relative blade tip speed, or Vt=V+u. At mu=1, V is equal to u and the tip airspeed is twice the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is quite}} common in {{aircraft}} for the propeller to be designed to vary pitch in flight, to give optimum thrust over {{the maximum amount of}} the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>speed</b> range, from takeoff and climb to cruise.|$|R
5000|$|The 9B {{began as}} the SIA.7B2 {{fitted with a}} much larger engine, the [...] Fiat A.14. The larger engine {{increased}} the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>speed,</b> but also its weight, resulting in only an overall slight increase in maximum speed.|$|R
50|$|Pilots {{prefer to}} take off and land facing into the wind. This {{has the effect of}} {{reducing}} the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>speed</b> over the ground (for the same, given airspeed) and hence reducing the length of runway required to perform either maneuver.|$|R
50|$|The {{profile drag}} of a rotor {{corresponds}} to the cube of its rotational speed.Reducing the rotational speed is therefore a significant reduction of rotor drag, allowing higher <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> or lower power consumption. A conventional rotor such as the UH-60A has lowest consumption around 75% rpm, but higher <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> (and weight) requires higher rpm.|$|E

50|$|Another area {{of concern}} for {{continued}} high-speed operation is the engines. Jet engines create thrust by increasing {{the temperature of the}} air they ingest, and as the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speeds</b> up, friction and compression heats this air before it reaches the engines. The maximum allowable temperature of the exhaust is determined by the materials in the turbine {{at the rear of the}} engine, so as the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speeds</b> up, the difference in intake and exhaust temperature that the engine can create decreases, and the thrust along with it. Air cooling the turbine area to allow operations at higher temperatures was a key solution, one that continued to improve through the 1950s and on to this day.|$|R
50|$|Separation: Maintaining a {{specific}} minimum distance between an aircraft and another aircraft or terrain to avoid collisions, normally by requiring aircraft to fly at set levels or level bands, on set routes or in certain directions, or by controlling an <b>aircraft's</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{propellers}} {{are another}} application. The governor senses shaft RPM, and adjusts or controls {{the angle of}} the blades to vary the torque load on the engine. Thus as the <b>aircraft</b> <b>speeds</b> up (as in a dive) or slows (in climb) the RPM is held constant.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{could carry}} 700 bomblets or 1,400 kg (3,090 lb) of bombs or torpedoes under the belly. The aircraft {{could also be}} fitted with air brakes for dive bombing.

50|$|The first {{jet engines}} were turbojets, {{with either a}} {{centrifugal}} compressor (as in the Heinkel HeS 3), or Axial compressors (as in the Junkers Jumo 004) which gave a smaller diameter, although longer, engine. By replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust higher <b>aircraft</b> <b>speeds</b> were attainable.|$|R
50|$|Because of Captain Gopujkar's action, the {{aircraft}} {{went back to}} the 'open descent' mode, causing the throttle to be in idle position.

50|$|On large jet {{aircraft}} the IAS {{is by far}} the most important speed indicator. Most <b>aircraft</b> <b>speed</b> limitations are based off IAS, as IAS closely reflects dynamic pressure.
