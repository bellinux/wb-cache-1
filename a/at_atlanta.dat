5|$|Jeff Gordon is an American racing {{driver who}} drove in the NASCAR Cup Series {{full-time}} from 1993 to 2015, winning 93 Cup Series races and four Cup championships. Gordon made his stock car {{debut in the}} NASCAR Busch Series on October 20, 1990, at North Carolina Motor Speedway for Hugh Connerty, crashing out on lap 33 and ending up with a 39th-place finish. The following year, Gordon began racing in the Busch Series full-time, driving for Bill Davis Racing. In his first year as a Busch driver he won Rookie of the Year. In 1992, Gordon set a NASCAR record by capturing 11 poles in a single Busch Series season. Later in the year, Rick Hendrick watched Gordon race in a Busch Series event <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Motor Speedway, and Gordon joined Hendrick Motorsports two days later. Gordon made his Winston Cup debut in the season-ending race, the Hooters 500 <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> finishing 31st after a crash.|$|E

5|$|She {{came close}} to winning her first ARCA race at {{the final round of}} the season, the Georgia Boot 400 <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Motor Speedway, having led a race-high 66 laps, but was {{overtaken}} by Bob Strait with three laps of the event remaining. Robinson finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship standings, making her the first woman to finish within the top-six final standings in an American national oval track motor sports series. In 2001, Robinson returned to NASCAR to drive the No. 99 Michael Waltrip Racing car for three races in the Busch Series with the objective of obtaining a season-long drive in 2002. The seat materialized when she met Tim Butler and Ken Butler of Aaron's <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Motor Speedway in the fall of 2000. She later {{received a phone call from}} team owner/driver Michael Waltrip who arranged a three-race agreement, but did not reply being under contact with Kranefuss. Bobby Kennedy acted as Robinson's crew chief. In her three races, she achieved one top-20 finish but did not finish the first two events having been involved in crashes. She continued a strong run in ARCA Series with two top-ten finishes in the season's first two races.|$|E

5|$|Favre {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons {{in the second round}} with the 33rd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft. On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, US$1.4million {{contract}} with a reported signing bonus of $350,000. Atlanta head coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of the drafting of Favre, saying it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into the game. Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins. He only attempted four passes in his career <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Favre took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven-yard loss.|$|E
5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the Sprint Cup Series for one race in Penske's No. 12: the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway. Starting in 10th place, he led for seven laps and finished 19th (one lap behind). Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due to the driver change Hornish had {{to move to the}} rear of the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of repair time. Hornish drove the car in the remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E

After the Hokies were held to a three-and-out, Christion Jones gave Alabama a 7–0 lead with his first touchdown on a 72-yard punt return. The teams then traded a series of punts before T. J. Yeldon extended the Alabama lead to 14–0 with his two-yard touchdown run that capped a 49-yard drive.|$|E

5|$|At the season's second race (at Rockingham Speedway), {{she started}} second but {{finished}} 36th after {{being involved in}} a crash. Two races later, Robinson won her first career pole position (and the first for {{a woman in the}} Busch Series) in the Busch Light 300 <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Motor Speedway. On the race's first lap, she battled with Joe Nemechek and Mike Wallace through the track's third turn when Wallace collided with Robinson which sent her into Nemechek. Robinson continued with heavy damage to the front-end of her car, but retired after completing 63 laps with radiator damage. She attempted to qualify for the Busch North Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway but did not record a fast enough lap time to start the race. Robinson achieved her first top-ten finish in the Busch Series later in the season with a tenth-place result in the Fay's 150 at Watkins Glen. However, she was released from the team shortly afterward due to a loss of sponsorship, and ended the year 47th overall. Robinson took time off to rebuild her psyche and self-confidence, and worked on interior decorating as a hobby. She married engine builder Jeff Clark in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Motor Speedway.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver was {{slated to}} compete with Tommy Maddox for the backup quarterback spot <b>at</b> <b>Atlanta</b> as {{training}} camp rolled around. Halfway through August, Maddox was released, and Tolliver was made the primary backup behind Chris Chandler. Tolliver played his first NFL game since 1994 on September 7, 1997 against the Carolina Panthers. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 79 yards. After relieving Chandler again the following week, Tolliver was slated to start the next game against the 49ers, in what became his only starting appearance of the season. He was slated to start again against the Denver Broncos, but instead came in late in the game. He was almost able to lead the Falcons to a comeback victory over the Broncos, completing six of nine passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, but he instead lost to the then-undefeated Broncos as the team remained winless. When Chandler went down with an injury in late October, coach Dan Reeves chose to start Tony Graziani. Shortly afterwards, Tolliver was released by the Falcons. In early November, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac was lost for the season due to a broken collarbone. As a result, the Chiefs signed Tolliver to a two-year contract as the third-string quarterback to replace him. Tolliver finished the season having completed 64 passes in 116 attempts for 677 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. Only one of the 116 attempts came as a Kansas City quarterback. The 1998 preseason began with Tolliver competing with Pat Barnes for the third-string quarterback job, but this ended when Tolliver was released by the Chiefs in August.|$|E
