5|$|The 1592 date {{remained}} the established one until the 19th century. In the 1870s, however, several publications corrected the dating <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> decades 1535 became the generally accepted date.

5|$|On 17 October 1933, {{aviation}} pioneer Hugo Junkers, {{owner of}} the Junkers Aircraft Works, was arrested <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days his company was expropriated by the regime. In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and {{under the direction of}} Aviation Minister Göring, production was immediately ramped up industry-wide. From a workforce of 3,200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932, the industry grew to employ {{a quarter of a million}} workers manufacturing over 10,000 technically advanced aircraft per year less than ten years later.|$|E

5|$|On arrival back in Australia, the AIF team played three {{first-class}} matches, {{defeating the}} reigning Sheffield Shield champions New South Wales and perennial Shield powerhouse Victoria. A likely victory against Queensland was frustrated due to torrential rain. The results in Australia demonstrated {{the strength of}} the AIF team <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months of the team's dissolution, Collins would make his Test début, along with his AIF team-mates, Gregory, wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield and the batsmen Johnny Taylor and Nip Pellew.|$|E
5|$|While rejecting Danish authority, Olaf made it {{his mission}} to convert Norway and the Norse colonies in the west as quickly and as {{completely}} as possible. Proceeding with threats, torture and executions, Olaf broke down pagan resistance <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years Norway was, at least nominally, a Christian country. But King Olaf had acquired several enemies during his meteoric rise to power. The most prominent were Eirik Jarl, son of Haakon Jarl, and Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, both of whom felt that Olaf had deprived them of their share of Norway.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had tried}} to remain {{anonymous}} at first, but he was soon identified, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M.

5|$|However, after {{less than}} a month back in York, William died, on 8 June 1154, {{allegedly}} due to poison administered in the chalice at Mass. One of William's clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king to be tried at the royal court. Before the trial could take place, however, Stephen died, and the trial never took place. William was buried in York Minster <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a sweet smell came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. Nor was the body decayed or burnt in the fire. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles. In 1227, he was canonised in Rome by Pope Honorius III.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed {{to improve the quality of}} the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, and the magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|M-150 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that runs through Rochester Hills and Rochester. It is more commonly known as Rochester Road and runs from a southern terminus at the M-59 freeway north through downtown Rochester to a northern terminus at Tienken Road. M-150 has been a state trunkline since around 1930, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years of its commissioning, it was extended south through Royal Oak and north into rural Oakland County. After changes in 1960s, the highway terminated in Troy at Interstate75 (I-75) on the southern end and Tienken Road on the north. Since 1987, it has ended at M-59.|$|E

5|$|The annals record Olaf's {{return to}} Ireland in 938 {{as well as}} a raid he carried out that year on Kilcullen in modern-day County Kildare, where he is said to have taken a {{thousand}} prisoners. Æthelstan died in October 939 and very soon afterwards Olaf left for York where he was able to quickly establish himself as king of Northumbria. Olaf was joined in England by his cousin Olaf Cuaran, and Olaf's brother Blácaire was left to rule in Dublin while he was away. Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum records that Olaf and the new English king Edmund met at Leicester in 939 and came to an agreement on dividing England between the two of them. This peace was short-lived <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years of the agreement the Vikings had seized the Five Boroughs of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} {{conflict}} which {{resulted from the}} Theban attempts to reorganise Greece had left {{much of the country}} war-weary and exhausted; a general peace (excluding only a recalcitrant Sparta) was therefore concluded between all the states of Greece in the aftermath of Mantinea. With the death of Epaminondas and significant loss of manpower at Mantinea, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system, and Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. It was the Athenians, and their second confederacy, who would be Macedon's main rivals for control of the lands of the north Aegean, and a major theme during the period was the regular state of war between Macedon and Athens.|$|E
5|$|After moving home to Kristiansund in 1913, Løvold was {{instrumental}} in establishing a wrestling club. The sport became popular <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years all the major sports clubs were offering wrestling. Especially the labor movement's clubs took up the sport, and Kristiansund was quickly known as a wrestling town. Løvold coached several clubs, including IL Nordlandet and Ynglingen. In 1913 he succeeded at getting sponsorships of NOK300 from various companies throughout town to purchase mats, which {{was instrumental}} in making the sport more popular in town. He later became known as a benefactor and sponsor of local wrestling. Kristiansund's first major national tournament was held in 1915 and the first Norwegian Championships in Kristiansund were held in 1922. Løvold also traveled to the neighboring town of Molde to establish a wrestling club there, although wrestling never became as popular in Molde as in Kristiansund. He also established Trondheim's first wrestling club. From 1939, when the labourers' wrestling clubs in Kristiansund merged to form the club Kristiansund AK, Løvold represented this club.|$|E

50|$|In 1821, Monmouth had a {{population}} of some 4,200 and, apart from being an important centre for a large country district, had several iron-foundries <b>and</b> paper-mills <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> miles.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government employees (with guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored water and power service, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in Manzanillo asked for medicine, clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured. Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of Manzanillo, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States. Eugene is one of three known July Pacific hurricane strikes, where hurricane-force winds are estimated over land. The other two hurricanes were Hurricane Calvin in 1993 and a hurricane that struck Baja California Sur in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} mostly focused in the Bay of Bengal, where {{six of the}} seven {{depressions}} developed. The remaining system was a tropical cyclone that developed in the Arabian Sea in November, which was also the only system that did not affect land. There were three cyclonic storms, which is below the average of 5.4. Only one storm formed {{before the start of}} the monsoon season in June, although it was also the most notable. On May10, a depression formed in the central Bay of Bengal, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days became a very severe cyclonic storm. After it stalled, it drew moisture from the southwest to produce severe flooding across Sri Lanka, killing 254people and becoming the worst floods there since 1947. Damage on the island totaled $135million (2003USD). The storm eventually made landfall in Myanmar on May19. It is possible that the storm contributed to a deadly heat wave in India due to shifting air currents.|$|E
5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, <b>and</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years more buildings had gone up, {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
