He returned to the ring after a 15-month interval. On 21 June 2008, Gomez lost what was seen as possibly his last bout: a last chance saloon opportunity to resurrect his career against rising star and Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan. Although scoring a surprise knockdown against Khan early on, the fight ended with Gomez being stopped in five rounds.|$|E
5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote, for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the family home.|$|E

25|$|When Sobhraj's {{sentence}} was to end, the 20-year Thai arrest warrant against him {{would still have}} been valid, thereby affecting his extradition and almost certain execution. So in March 1986, in his tenth year in prison, he threw a big party for his guards and fellow inmates, drugged them with sleeping pills <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the jail. Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Mumbai police apprehended Sobhraj in O'Coquero Restaurant in Goa; his prison term was prolonged by ten years, {{just as he had}} hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence and even witnesses against him long lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France.|$|E
25|$|The {{company and}} union resumed talks on February 4, 1980, but the discussions ended {{after just one}} day.

The union rejected the proposal without explanation <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the talks. The strike, by now the longest in International Harvester's history {{as well as the}} longest in UAW history (surpassing the old record of 117 days), resumed and the union threatened to stay on the picket line until March if necessary. Industry analysts worried that IH would begin to lose market share as its inventories dropped.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{returned}} in June 2003 to referee the Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a Raw broadcast in Madison Square Garden, he was honored for his achievements {{in the ring}} and presented with the retired WWE Hardcore Championship belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down stairs by Randy Orton and Ric Flair. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of Raw. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton on the December 15 episode of Raw <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the match rather than face him, {{the result of the}} match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why {{he walked out of the}} match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Styles {{filled in}} for Angle and teamed with The Main Event Mafia in a five-on-five tag team match against Aces & Eights at , {{securing}} the victory {{for his team}} by pinning Devon, though he later {{said that he had}} not joined The New Main Evet Mafia. On the August 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles defeated Bobby Roode in a Bound for Glory series match to earn seven points. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles won a gauntlet battle royal match by last eliminating Daniels to gain twenty points and secure the top spot in the Bound for Glory series. At , Styles defeated Austin Aries in the semi-finals and later defeated Magnus in the finals to win the 2013 Bound for Glory Series and become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles claimed he was no longer under contract with TNA and insulted Dixie Carter, who responded by saying that Styles was not a great wrestler. In {{the weeks leading up to}} Bound for Glory, Styles continued to appear on Impact Wrestling despite not having a contract with the company, but he would defeat Bully Ray at Bound for Glory, despite interference from Aces & Eights and Carter, to win his second TNA World Heavyweight Championship and fifth world title in the company overall. Styles made his first televised title defense on the following episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Ray in a rematch after interference from Mr. Anderson, after which he refused Carter's new contract offer <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> TNA with the title. On October 29, TNA vacated the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 2 taping of Impact Wrestling which aired on January 2, Styles returned to TNA with his championship to confront Carter and Magnus (who had won a tournament to crown the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion), with Styles challenging Magnus to a title unification match on next weeks episode of Impact Wrestling, which Magnus accepted. Magnus won to unify both titles after interference from eight other wrestlers on Magnus' behalf and Sting interfering on Styles' behalf in what would be Styles' final match with TNA. On December 8 it was reported that contract negotiations between Styles and TNA had broken down and that Styles would be leaving the promotion, becoming a free agent effective December 17 and ending his near twelve-year association with the company.|$|E

500|$|The Boston congregants, {{followers}} of Hutchinson, were now emboldened {{to seize the}} offensive and discredit the orthodox doctrines at services throughout the colony.

[...] As Hutchinson's followers attacked ministers with questions calculated to diminish confidence in their teachings, Winthrop continued his lament, [...] "so many objections made by the opinionists...against our doctrine delivered, if it suited not their new fancies." [...] When Wilson rose to preach or pray, the Hutchinsonians boldly rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the meeting house. [...] While Wilson was the favorite butt of this abuse, it was not restricted just to the Boston church, and similar gestures were being made toward the other ministers who preached a covenant of works.|$|E

500|$|The McGuinn–Hillman–White–Parsons line-up was {{together}} {{for less than}} a month before Hillman quit to join Gram Parsons in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers. [...] Hillman had become increasingly disenchanted with the Byrds since the South African débâcle and he was also frustrated by business manager Larry Spector's mishandling of the group's finances. [...] Things came to a head on September 15, 1968, following a band performance at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, when Hillman and Spector came to blows backstage. [...] In a fit of rage, Hillman threw down his bass in disgust <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the group. [...] Following his exit, Hillman would have a successful career both as a solo artist and with bands such as the Flying Burrito Brothers, Manassas, the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band, and the Desert Rose Band. [...] He remains active, releasing albums and touring, often with ex-Desert Rose Band member Herb Pedersen.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{position}} in the Norwegian metal scene was controversial from the beginning. Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'" [...] In the liner notes of Martyrium, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: [...] "For those of you who despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us, may God have mercy on your poor souls!" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Sylvain said Rundgren {{was not an}} interfering producer, he {{occasionally}} involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him {{to use as a}} click track. During another session, he stopped a take <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the control room to plug in Kane's bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, [...] "Yeah, that's all you needed. Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: [...] "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." [...] Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a [...] "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on [...] "Personality Crisis". While recording the song, Johansen walked back into the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded [...] "ludicrous enough".|$|E

On June 9, McCool, Jillian Hall, Kristal and Ashley participated in a [...] "Bikini Contest", which Massaro won. Hall, Kristal and Ashley stripped down, but McCool rejected, saying she had too much class, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring. McCool appeared in a backstage segment with Ashley on June 16, where Ashley {{wanted to have a}} 1-on-1 [...] "Bikini Contest" [...] with her, but McCool declined. McCool and Kristal had a catfight backstage with Jillian Hall and Ashley on July 14, which prompted a feud between the four Divas. On July 15, McCool and Victoria reached the finals of a Divas Mechanical Bull Riding Contest, which McCool won. On July 21, McCool and Kristal lost a tag team match against Hall and Ashley, after Ashley pinned Kristal.

McCool won her first singles match in WWE on July 28, defeating Jillian Hall.|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} {{the final}} of the Northern Ireland Trophy, which he lost 6–9 to Ding Junhui, he {{defeated}} semi–final opponent Dominic Dale 6–0, in only 53 minutes—a record for a best-of-11-frames match. O'Sullivan then reached the quarter-finals of the Grand Prix, but lost 1–5 against eventual champion Neil Robertson. In December 2006, in his quarter-final match of the UK Championship against Hendry, O'Sullivan conceded in dramatic fashion part-way into the sixth frame of the best-of-17 match. He had gone 0–4 down after a strong start from Hendry, before finally taking a frame back. At the beginning of the sixth frame, O'Sullivan opened with a break of 24, before leaving himself a difficult shot from black to red. After missing the red, he calmly shook the hand of both Hendry (saying to him that he had [...] "had enough of it, mate") and the match referee, Jan Verhaas, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the arena, stunning everyone present. The incident caused minor disruption to the other quarter-final match, between Graeme Dott and Steve Davis, being played simultaneously in the same arena. Dott later said that he initially thought that O'Sullivan and Hendry were having a fight when he heard an audience member shout [...] "Get a grip, Ronnie." [...] It was later officially confirmed that O'Sullivan had forfeited the match, which was awarded 9–1 to Hendry. O’Sullivan issued a statement later that day, apologising and saying that he would be [...] "back on his feet fighting stronger and harder than ever very soon." [...] On 31 May 2007, World Snooker fined him a total of £20,800 over this incident, and docked 900 ranking points from him.|$|E
