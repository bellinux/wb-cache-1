40|$|Many {{people believe}} that the research-based {{pharmaceutical}} industry has <b>a</b> ‘special’ <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to provide lifesaving medications to the needy, either free-ofcharge or at a reduced rate relative {{to the cost of}} manufacture. In this essay, I argue that we can explain the ubiquitous notion of <b>a</b> special <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> as <b>an</b> expression of emotionally charged intuitions involving sacred or protected values and an aversive response to betrayal in an asymmetric trust relationship. I then review the most common arguments used to justify the claim that the pharmaceutical industry has <b>a</b> special <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> and show why these justifications fail. Taken together, these conclusions call into question the conventional ideologies that have traditionally animated the debate on whether the pharmaceutical industry has special duties of beneficence and distributive justice with respect to the impoverished in dire need of their products...|$|R

Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, {{one of the reasons why}} the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E

The schism between Rome and the Byzantine Empire was a severe blow to him, and he worked hard to restore the former amicable relationship. Gregory successfully tried {{to get in touch}} with the emperor Michael VII.

In his efforts to recruit for the expedition, he emphasized the suffering of eastern Christians, arguing western Christians had <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to go to their aid.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, as Chairman of EDB, {{he decided}} to name {{publicly}} the holders of government scholarships who broke their bonds to shame them. This created a controversy generating public debates on whether those who received scholarship have <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to serve, or whether the scholarship is merely a contractual agreement which could be broken {{in return for the}} stated penalties. The debate culminated when MP Chng Hee Kok (庄熙国) questioned Yeo's decision. Yeo responded by calling for Chng to resign his seat in Parliament because of his view. This led to even more unhappiness at the audacity of a civil servant talking down to an elected Member of Parliament. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had to intervene in what was seen as a face-saving rebuke for both– that Philip Yeo was wrong to tell Chng Hee Kok to resign, but Chng had also been wrong in arguing that it was acceptable for scholars to break their bonds because they were merely legal contracts.|$|E
25|$|Aiken was Minister for Finance {{for three}} years {{following}} the war and was involved in economic post–war development in the industrial, agricultural, educational and other spheres. However, it was during his two periods as Minister for External Affairs—1951 to 1954, and 1957 to 1969-that Aiken fulfilled his enormous political potential. As Foreign Minister he adopted where possible an independent stance for Ireland at the United Nations and other international forums such as the Council of Europe. Despite {{a great deal of}} opposition, both at home and abroad, he stubbornly asserted the right of smaller UN member countries to discuss the representation of communist China at the General Assembly. Unable to bring the issue of the partition of Ireland to the UN, because of Britain's veto on the Security Council and unwillingness of other Western nations to interfere in what they saw as British affairs at that time (the US taking a more ambiguous position), Aiken ensured that Ireland vigorously defended the rights of small nations such as Tibet and Hungary, nations whose problems he felt Ireland could identify with and had <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to help.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation,</b> not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E
40|$|An {{obligation}} to render assistance {{to those who}} are in distress at sea has long been recognized in international maritime law. Recent developments in international human rights law have also resulted in a greater understanding of states' extraterritorial obligations which have the capability to extend protection to migrants in distress at sea. These human rights obligations are most commonly defined by whether the relevant state exercises 'jurisdiction' over the area, person or event in question. When such jurisdiction is not present, states are relieved of any human rights obligations to take action or for injury caused by their inaction. Yet in many instances they will still feel compelled to act through some form of <b>a</b> latent <b>moral</b> <b>obligation.</b> Often this <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> arises out of a desire to assist and protect the world's most vulnerable populations. This paper will explore the dichotomy between these obligations with regard to the perilous position of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. Specifically it seeks to find the dividing line between where a state's international legal obligations end and where their <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> commence. Through analysis of selected jurisprudence concerning the position of migrants at sea, decisions of the main human rights treaty monitoring bodies and with a particular focus on the European Court of Human Rights, this paper will attempt to identify the limits of a state's international legal obligations. Consideration will be given to when these obligations arise, how far they extend, what rights and protections are available under them {{and the extent to which}} there is room for further interpretation. The result of this will be an identification of the limits of law's promise in relation to migrants at sea. Beyond the reach of legal obligations lie loosely crafted <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> which compel states to assist those persons most in need. Influenced by global policy, security and economics, and characterized by inconsistency in practice, the limits of <b>a</b> state's <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> are vastly more uncertain. Through analysis of state efforts, actions and declarations this paper will therefore deconstruct a pattern for when <b>a</b> state's <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> will compel them to act with regard to migrants at sea. There exists a grey area between the international legal obligations incumbent on states and the actions which they are willing to take to fulfil their perceived <b>moral</b> <b>obligations.</b> <b>As</b> migrants at sea are most vulnerable within this disconnect a proposal will be made for how this gap can be bridged. The result of this analysis will be a clearer identification of the limits of law's promise in the Global North, particularly towards the most vulnerable populations leaving the Global South...|$|R

500|$|In 1843, Holmes {{published}} [...] "The Contagiousness of puerperal fever" [...] in {{the short-lived}} publication New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery. The essay argued—contrary {{to popular belief}} at the time, which predated germ theory of disease—that the cause of puerperal fever, a deadly infection contracted by women during or shortly after childbirth, stems from patient to patient contact via their physicians. Holmes gathered a large collection of evidence for this theory, including stories of doctors who had become ill and died after performing autopsies on patients who had likewise been infected. In concluding his case, he insisted that a physician in whose practice even one case of puerperal fever had occurred, had <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> to purify his instruments, burn the clothing he had worn while assisting in the fatal delivery, and cease obstetric practice {{for a period of}} at least six months.
