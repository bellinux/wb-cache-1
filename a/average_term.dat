40|$|Capítulos en librosA new {{forecasting}} {{method for}} functional time series is proposed. This model attempts to generalize the standard scalar ARMA time series {{model to the}} $L^ 2 $ Hilbert space in order to forecast functional time series. A functional time series is the realization of a stochastic process where each observation is a continuous function defined in a finite interval $[a,b]$. Forecasting these time series require a model that can operate with continuous functions. The structure of the proposed model is a regression where functional parameters operate on functional variables. The variables can be lagged values of the series (autoregressive terms), past observed errors (moving <b>average</b> <b>terms)</b> or exogenous variables. The functional parameters used are integral operators in the $L^ 2 $ space. In our approach, the kernels of the operators are given as a linear combination of sigmoid functions. The parameters of each sigmoid are estimated using a Quasi-Newton algorithm minimizing the sum of squared errors. This is a novel approach because the iterative algorithm allows estimating the moving <b>average</b> <b>terms.</b> The new model is tested with functional time series obtained from real data of the Spanish electricity market and compared with other functional reference models. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

There is also some flexibility {{when it comes to the}} definition of d(x,y) where any of the well known metrics can be used, like Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance based on the geometry of the clustering problem. This formulation has a peculiar problem, in that if one of the clusters is badly behaved, where the others are tightly packed, since the denominator contains a 'max' term instead of an <b>average</b> <b>term,</b> the Dunn Index for that set of clusters will be uncharacteristically low. This is thus a worst case indicator, and has to be kept in mind. There are ready implementations of the Dunn index in some vector based programming languages like MATLAB, R and Apache Mahout.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is two-fold. The first goal is to develop an {{efficient}} Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating an ARMA model with a Markov-switching mean, based on a multi-move sampler. Unlike the existing algorithm (Billio et al. (1999) based on a single-move sampler, our algorithm can achieve reasonably fast convergence to the posterior distribution even when the latent regime indicator variable is highly persistent or when there exists an absorbing state. The second goal is to appropriately investigate the dynamics of the latent ex-ante real interest rate (EARR) under regime shifts, by employing the econometric tool developed. The rational expectations assumption implies the ex-post real interest rate (EPRR) follows an ARMA process when the latent EARR is assumed to follow an AR process. Our empirical results show that an omission of moving <b>average</b> <b>terms</b> in the dynamics of EPRR as in Garcia and Perron (1996) may result in misleading inference about the dynamics of the EARR. By correctly incorporating moving <b>average</b> <b>terms</b> in the dynamics of the EPRR, we get estimates of the EARR which exhibit considerable variation and high persistence within each regime...|$|R
