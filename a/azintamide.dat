40|$|Twenty tablets were powdered, and {{a portion}} {{containing}} ≃ 10 mg of <b>azintamide</b> (I) and ≃ 1 mg of papaverine hydrochloride (II) was extracted by mechanical shaking for ≃ 15 min with 80 ml of mobile phase [acetonitrile - H 2 O (14 : 11) ]. The vol. was adjusted to 100 ml with mobile phase, the mixture was filtered, and {{portions of the}} filtrate were diluted to 20 ml before analysis on a stainless-steel column (12. 5 cm × 4 mm) of Hibar 100 RP- 18 LiChrospher (5 µm) with a mobile phase flow rate of 1 ml min– 1, and 240 -nm detection. The recoveries of I and II were 100. 39 ± 0. 70 % (n = 12) and 99. 97 ± 1. 11 % (n = 12), respectively. The method was accurate, with coeff. of variation (n = 10) of 0. 7 % and 0. 9 %, respectively, {{for the analysis of}} standard mixtures containing 5. 5 and 0. 55 µg ml– 1...|$|E
