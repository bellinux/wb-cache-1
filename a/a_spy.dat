5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be <b>a</b> <b>spy,</b> Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Alkin until 1645; because of {{comments}} of her age made later in life, her date of birth is taken to be around 1600. She was the wife of Francis Alkin, <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> for the Parliamentarians who was hanged early in the English Civil War by royalist forces for his activities. She {{was the mother of}} three children.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is <b>a</b> <b>spy.</b> This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} resurfaced {{again in}} February 2016, when the Institute of National Remembrance seized {{materials from the}} widow of Czesław Kiszczak, a former minister of the interior, that were said to document Wałęsa’s role as <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> for the security services.|$|E
5|$|Under {{interrogation}} by MI5 officer William Skardon at {{an informal}} meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> {{and was not}} detained. In January 1950, Fuchs arranged another interview with Skardon and voluntarily confessed that he was <b>a</b> <b>spy.</b> Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs's statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a key witness in the trials of David Greenglass and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the United States.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> {{working for}} the {{government}} of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather intelligence on resistance groups the U.S. government was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the German nuclear program. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He spent the last two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond was {{the younger}} son of Bohemond III of Antioch {{by his first}} wife, Orgueilleuse of Harenc. He was born around 1175. His mother was last {{mentioned}} in a charter issued in 1175. Bohemond's widowed father married a relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, Theodora, but he repudiated her shortly after Manuel's death in 1180. He married Sybil, an Antiochene noblewoman, described as a prostitute or sorcerer by 12th-century authors. She was <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> of Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria. Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, excommunicated Bohemond's father for his third marriage.|$|E

5|$|Born in the United Kingdom to Russian émigré parents, Fisher {{moved to}} Russia in the 1920s {{and served in}} the Soviet {{military}} before undertaking foreign service as a radio operator in Soviet intelligence in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He later served in an instructional role before taking part in intelligence operations against the Germans during World War II. After the war, he began working for the KGB, which {{sent him to the}} United States where he worked as part of <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> ring based in New York City.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was <b>a</b> <b>spy,</b> but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt's {{acceptance}} by the Qadiriyya, an Islamic order, convinced the French administration {{that she was}} <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> or an agitator. She survived an assassination attempt shortly thereafter. In 1901 the French administration ordered her to leave Algeria, but she was allowed to return the following year after marrying her long-time partner, the Algerian soldier Slimane Ehnni. Following her return, Eberhardt wrote for a newspaper published by Victor Barrucand and worked for General Hubert Lyautey. In 1904, {{at the age of}} 27, she was killed by a flash flood in Aïn Sefra.|$|E

Peter Kerr, who had served with Fannin and {{claimed to have been}} held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender, but would later claim to have uncovered evidence that Kerr was <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> for the Mexicans.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's second non-fiction {{book was}} {{published}} in November 1963: Thrilling Cities, a reprint {{of a series of}} Sunday Times articles based on Fleming's impressions of a number of world cities in trips taken during 1959 and 1960. Approached in 1964 by producer Norman Felton to write <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters Napoleon Solo and April Dancer, for the series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to avoid any legal problems that might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.|$|E
5|$|Followers of Biko's ideas re-organised as the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), which {{subsequently}} {{split into}} the Socialist Party of Azania and the Black People's Convention. Several figures {{associated with the}} ANC denigrated Biko during the 1980s. For instance, members of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front assembled outside Biko's Ginsberg home shouting U-Steve Biko, I-CIA!, an allegation that Biko was <b>a</b> <b>spy</b> for the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These demonstrations resulted in clashes with Biko supporters from AZAPO.|$|E
