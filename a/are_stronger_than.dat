5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E

Rolled threads <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> cut threads, with increases of 10% to 20% in tensile strength and possibly more in fatigue resistance and wear resistance.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{chemical}} composition of garnet varies, the atomic bonds in some species <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> in others. As a result, this mineral group shows {{a range of}} hardness on the Mohs scale of about 6.5 to 7.5. The harder species like almandine are often used for abrasive purposes.|$|E

25|$|The game also {{features}} heroes, {{who have more}} health points and <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> normal units, and who can acquire special abilities when they level up. In some missions, if the player's hero dies, the mission is immediately over. If the mission {{does not require the}} hero to survive, but he is killed in combat, the player can revive him in the main building for a fee.|$|E
25|$|Implicit graph {{models have}} also {{been used as a}} form of relativization in order to prove separations between {{complexity}} classes that <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the known separations for non-relativized models. For instance, Childs et al. used neighborhood representations of implicit graphs to define a graph traversal problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer but that requires exponential time to solve on any classical computer.|$|E
25|$|Traditional seismic design {{assumes that}} the lower stories of a {{building}} <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the upper stories and where {{this is not the}} case—if the lower story is less strong than the upper structure—the structure will not respond to earthquakes in the expected fashion. Using modern design methods, it is possible to take a weak story into account. Several failures of this type in one large apartment complex caused most of the fatalities in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.|$|E

25|$|Large backpacks, used {{to carry}} loads over , as well as smaller sports backpacks (e.g. running, cycling, hiking and hydration), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of their weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the {{shoulder}} straps mainly for stabilising the load. This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the hips <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance, since the load rides nearer the wearer's own center of mass.|$|E
25|$|Ducats rewarded from Commercing are {{separate}} from the Gold currency obtained in the game. Ducats allows the player to purchase various items sold by the Mercantile Imp found at each Trading Post. Items sold by the Mercantile Imp include Fomorian-variant weapons which <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> normal weapons, however a special stone upgrade cannot be performed on them. Occasionally, the selection may include Legendary Weapons which may yield various effects (i.e. the Legendary Weapon, Tyrfing greatly increases the weapon's damage after rendered unconscious).|$|E
25|$|Networks {{of various}} sorts play an {{integral}} part in many theories of semantic memory. Generally speaking, a network is composed {{of a set of}} nodes connected by links. The nodes may represent concepts, words, perceptual features, or nothing at all. The links may be weighted such that some <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> others or, equivalently, have a length such that some links take longer to traverse than others. All these features of networks have been employed in models of semantic memory, examples of which are found below.|$|E

25|$|HDPE {{is defined}} by a density of greater or equal to 0.941nbsp&g/cm3. HDPE has a low degree of branching. The mostly linear {{molecules}} pack together well, so intermolecular forces <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts or metallocene catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, {{the small amount of}} branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of free radicals at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add {{to the ends of the}} molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows {{the intensity of the}} scattered light as a function of its frequency difference Δν to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around Δν=0. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E
