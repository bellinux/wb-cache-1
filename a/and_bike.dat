40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramKatie M. HeinrichThis {{report was}} focused on my field {{experience}} at the Department of Public Health at Fort Riley Army Installation. The purpose of this report was two-fold. First, I have outlined and described my experiences with various groups within the Department of Public Health. Second, I aimed to evaluate policies and programs focused on promoting environmental change for walking <b>and</b> <b>biking</b> <b>and</b> gave direction to the Army Corp of Engineers on best practices for walking <b>and</b> <b>biking</b> for transportation. The objectives were to identify key agencies responsible for <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian infrastructure, understand how those agencies could work together to improve the built environment for walking <b>and</b> <b>biking</b> <b>and</b> develop intervention strategies to improve walking <b>and</b> <b>biking</b> on Fort Riley...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} hiking <b>and</b> <b>biking</b> trails in the Conservation Area totaling 7.3 mi. The Busch Hiking <b>and</b> <b>Biking</b> Trail is the area's longest trail at 3.2 mi and {{is open to}} both hiking <b>and</b> <b>biking,</b> as is the 2 mi long Hamburg Trail.

5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|London {{has nine}} major parks and gardens {{throughout}} the city, {{many of which}} run along the Thames River and are interconnected {{by a series of}} pedestrian <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> paths, known as the Thames Valley Parkway. This path system is 40km (25mi) in length, and connects to an additional 150km (93mi) of bike and hiking trails throughout the city. The city's largest park, Springbank Park, is 140-hectare (300 acre) and contains 30km (19mi) of trails. It is also home to Storybook Gardens, a family attraction open year-round.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{transport}} authorities began a {{feasibility study}} in 2006 {{to evaluate the}} introduction of congestion pricing. The charge would be combined with other traffic reduction implementations, allowing money to be raised for public transit improvements <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> and pedestrian enhancements. The initial pricing scenarios were presented in public meetings conducted in December 2008, and the final study results were announced in November 2010, proposing modified alternatives based on the public's feedbacks, and the updated proposal calls for implementing a six-month to one-year trial in 2015.|$|E

5|$|NYC Ferry {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015. It was planned to launch in two phases. The first phase launched on May 1, 2017, with service along the East River and to the Rockaways. Routes to Bay Ridge and Astoria respectively started in June and August of that year. A second phase, in 2018, will launch to the Lower East Side and Soundview. A ferry to Coney Island and Stapleton is under consideration. Single-ride trips on the system cost $2.75, with monthly <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> fares also available, {{but there is no}} free transfer to other modes of transport in the city. NYC Ferry also provides free shuttle buses in the Rockaways, connecting to the ferry stop there.|$|E
5|$|Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area is {{reliant on}} a complex {{multimodal}} infrastructure consisting of roads, bridges, highways, rail, tunnels, airports, <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> and pedestrian paths. The development, maintenance, {{and operation of}} these different modes of transportation are overseen by various agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. These and other organizations collectively manage several interstate highways and state routes, two subway networks, two commuter rail agencies, eight trans-bay bridges, transbay ferry service, local bus service, three international airports (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), and an extensive network of roads, tunnels, and paths such as the San Francisco Bay Trail.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
