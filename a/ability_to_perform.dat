5|$|Characteristics differ {{between various}} groups of Icelandic horses, {{depending}} on the focus of individual breeders. Some focus on animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected for their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E
5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} that works {{based on the principle}} of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident in his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
25|$|Certain cricketers {{developed}} reputations {{for their}} outstanding <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> on sticky wickets. Australian Victor Trumper was one.|$|R

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that after 1593, Vittoria is never heard of again while Raffaella gained {{tremendous}} fame for her musical <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> and <b>to</b> lead.|$|R
5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> well in big games.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body it results in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> this test.|$|E
5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught {{the meanings of}} the Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training. More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> basic arithmetic.|$|E
40|$|I {{review the}} status of today’s {{theoretical}} description of Standard Model processes relevant for Tevatron and LHC analyses, and of the tools {{that are used in}} phenomenological studies. I will also discuss a few recent ideas to further refine our <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> technically challenging calculations...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before (‘Theoretical considerations’ section), the actual behavioural control (or the objective measures of control) refer {{not only to}} the person’s skills and <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> the behaviour but also to different factors (enablers and constraints) that may enable or disable the individual to act as intended.|$|R
50|$|Miller/Hobart dissents from James's {{new idea}} about free will, {{constructing}} a distinctive reconciling compatibilism that dispenses with any requirement for {{chance in the}} analysis of what persons' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> alternate acts. Rather than analyzing causality as Hume did, Hobart focuses on moral evaluation of acts and character.|$|R
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|Lovato {{also stated}} that her struggles with addictions not only caused her to nearly {{overdose}} several times, but later began to impact her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> and promote her third studio album Unbroken, referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover. After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol struggles.|$|E
5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
50|$|Organizational {{capacity}} building - {{another form of}} {{capacity building}} that is focused on developing capacity within organizations like NGOs. It refers {{to the process of}} enhancing an organization's <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> specific activities. An Organizational capacity building approach is used by NGOs to develop internally so they can better fulfill their defined mission.|$|R
50|$|The Central Asian is {{a working}} breed of dog, and {{different}} breed fanciers organizations issue sets or rules and recommendations important <b>to</b> preserve dogs’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> certain duties. This includes special {{tests to determine}} a dog’s inborn qualities, and training degrees or titles aimed to show what the dog can learn to do.|$|R
50|$|International posture, {{along with}} second-language {{confidence}} in communication, was also seen as directly influencing WTC. While proficiency {{was seen as}} influencing confidence in second language communication, the path was not significant. In the Japanese context, this implies that students do have the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> in the second language, yet lack confidence in communicating in the second language.|$|R
5|$|Renney {{grew up in}} Cranbrook, British Columbia {{and became}} {{interested}} in wrestling at age seven while watching a televised match between Bruno Sammartino and Gorilla Monsoon. He gained combat sport experience by earning black belts in both judo and jujutsu, and he moved to Edmonton, Alberta to train as a wrestler. He made his debut in Edmonton and wrestled in several matches there before moving to Tampa, Florida. Starting out, he wrestled for Independent Pro Wrestling, making $30 per match or less and sometimes competing in exchange for food and drinks. Juggernaut became known for his hardcore wrestling abilities, but he also impressed observers with his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> a moonsault.|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} the Batmobile as a drivable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be {{summoned to the}} player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|The morale {{system in}} the game is similar to {{previous}} Dynasty Warrior games. Morale is increased and decreased by performing a number of positive actions for the player’s army. Action that produce this effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty, defeating enemy officers, and completing special events such as ambushes, siege attacks, and finding enemy strongholds. Morale in the game has a strong effect on the player's forces, determining their strength and speed, {{as well as their}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> Berwald attacks. Morale will also affect how the CPU characters move along through battle. Example: Ally Oxenstiernas are winning.|$|E
5000|$|Barratt was {{dismissed}} from his Secretary role at Defence in August 1999, {{with a letter}} saying he was being dismissed because his minister John Moore [...] "had lost trust and confidence" [...] in his <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> his duties. Barratt fought the dismissal, taking his case to the Federal Court, but conceded defeat in March 2000 following rejection of his appeal.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, the {{university}} constructed a microsurgery lab, {{a collaborative effort}} between Mercy Hospital and {{the university}}. Microsugery, conducted underneath a microscope, permits surgeons <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> sensitive and delicate procedures {{which could not be}} done otherwise in areas such as ophthalmology, gynecology, urology, neurosurgery, cardiac and general vascular surgeery, plastic surgery, and orthopedic surgery. The lab gives local surgeons the opportunity <b>to</b> develop their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> such procedures while also allowing students to conduct research and gain invaluable experience.|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{describes}} Gongsun Sheng {{as eight}} chi tall, with eyebrows resembling the Chinese character for [...] "eight" [...] (八), almond-like {{eyes and a}} noble appearance. A Taoist priest from Jizhou (薊州; present-day Ji County, Tianjin), he possesses the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> magic, summon the wind and rain, ride the mist and drive the clouds. Such is his sheer magical powers and mystique that he earns the nickname [...] "Dragon in the Clouds". He wields an ancient sword made of copper.|$|R
5|$|To aid in his {{ministry}} to the Jewish people, Jesus {{was given the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> miracles, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through {{his ministry}}, Jesus {{is seen as a}} precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E
5|$|Akishio {{took part}} in the Pacific Reach 2000 drills, which took place from 2 to 14 October 2000, off of Singapore. The navies of the United States, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea took part. Because of the Kursk {{submarine}} disaster which had happened earlier that year, the Pacific Reach 2000 drills involved submarine rescue exercises, which Akishio performed in. This was the first time Japanese ships had taken part in a multilateral submarine rescue drill, although they had taken part in similar exercises bilaterally, with the US Navy. Japan's constitution places limits on their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> collective-defence drills. Because of this, Japan joined the drills from a humanitarian standpoint, rather than a military one.|$|E
5|$|Based on the James Bond film, Rare's GoldenEye 007 was {{released}} in 1997, and as of 2004 it was the best-selling Nintendo 64 game in the United States. It was the first landmark console first-person shooter and was highly acclaimed for its atmospheric single-player levels and well designed multiplayer maps. It featured a sniper rifle, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> head-shots, and the incorporation of stealth elements; (and all these aspects were also used in the game's spiritual sequel Perfect Dark) as well as Virtua Cop-inspired features such as reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocents, and an aiming system allowing players to aim at a precise spot on the screen.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} differences in self-perceived abilities of supported employment specialists <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> supported employment processes in relation to their educational backgrounds in South Korea. In order to identify this subject, a research <b>performed</b> survey <b>to</b> 100 supported employment specialist. All supported employment specialists identified were surveyed regarding their self-perceived <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> supported employment processes, along with their demographic characteristics. Two independent variables, education level and academic major, were used in this study. The dependent variable was self-perceived abilities of supported employment specialists <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> seven supported employment processes, such as Job development, Job analysis, Vocational evaluation, Client to job matching, On the job training, Ongoing assessment, and Follow up. The results of this study indicated supported employment specialists who had completed undergraduate degrees perceived their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> be significantly higher than supported employment specialists who had completed graduate degree in performing the competencies of each supported employment process, except vocational assessment. However, the significant results in this research hypothesis indicated the opposite outcome to the proposed research hypothesis 2. Next, there is no differences of self-perceived <b>ability</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>performing</b> supported employment between supported employment specialists who had majored (vocational) rehabilitation and supported employment specialists who had majored social work, psychology, and others. Finally, there are no differences of self-perceived <b>ability</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>performing</b> supported employment processes, except job analysis and on-going assessment according to the interaction effect between the education level and major. The findings of this study are discussed in implication for rehabilitation practice and education, and future research...|$|R

5|$|Harmonix {{was formed}} in 1995 from a {{computer}} music group at MIT. Beginning in 1998, the company developed music games inspired by PaRappa the Rapper. In 2001, the company released Frequency, which puts the player in control of multiple instrument tracks. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the game provides {{a greater sense of}} creative freedom than earlier rhythm titles. Frequency was critically acclaimed; however, marketing was made difficult by the game's abstract style, which removed the player's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> for onlookers. In 2003, Harmonix followed up Frequency with the similar Amplitude. The company later released more socially driven, karaoke-themed music games in Karaoke Revolution and SingStar (2003 and 2004, respectively). Donkey Konga, a GameCube title developed by Namco and released in 2003, achieved widespread success by leveraging Nintendo's Donkey Kong brand.|$|E
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in the chaos and journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> a shout. The city's guards inform the player that they must be Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{need for}} human {{attention}} and eagerness to please and impress its owner, the Prague Ratter generally responds well to basic training and commands. This bright breed has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> many impressive tricks and tasks. Many owners claim that these dogs {{can easily be}} taught to use a litter box, thus {{eliminating the need for}} constant trips outdoors.|$|R
