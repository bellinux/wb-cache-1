5|$|Nixon in China is {{an opera}} in three acts by John Adams, with a {{libretto}} by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it {{was inspired by}} U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972. The work premiered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams {{with the idea for}} the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.|$|E
