5|$|There {{had been}} {{criticism}} of MIS companies generally, and Great Southern Group (as the largest {{company in the}} sector) in particular, suggesting that their appetite for land for plantations and agribusiness was driving up land prices in some regions, and distorting some commodity markets. In 2004, Great Southern's leading competitor Timbercorp reported a rise in plantation land prices from around A$3,000 to around A$6,000 per hectare in just five years. The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land, with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations. Some farmers claimed that MIS were driving up prices in <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> markets. Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing shrinkage of towns or was, conversely, stimulating employment.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture {{is a major}} draw on water from aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>water</b> usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic composition of soil water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic composition of soil water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic composition of soil water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of soil water and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E
40|$|Diffuse {{nutrient}} and pesticide {{pollution is}} a major global and growing pressure on water quality and poses risks to aquatic ecosystems, human health and water resources. Due to threats to water quality, the costs of water treatment and the recalcitrance of some pollutants to traditional water treatment techniques, there is increased focus on the potential to mitigate <b>agricultural</b> diffuse <b>water</b> pollution through catchment management. Water quality models {{have the potential to}} be applied as decision support tools to identify mitigation measures that can reduce <b>agricultural</b> diffuse <b>water</b> pollution but, to date, insufficient consideration has been given to the uncertainties of water quality model predictions and the impacts of farm-based mitigation measures on multiple pollutants and at a daily temporal resolution. To address these shortcomings, and the need to identify mitigation measures that can reduce <b>agricultural</b> diffuse <b>water</b> pollution, the soil and water assessment tool model was applied to identify the impacts of farm-based mitigation measures on diffuse nitrate, total phosphorus and metaldehyde pollution at a daily time-step within the River Wensum catchment in the East of England. Prohibiting metaldehyde application in areas where the slope exceeded 2 % was the most effective option to mitigate diffuse metaldehyde pollution, whilst introducing a red clover cover crop reduced nitrate losses by 19. 6 % and implementing buffer strips of 6 m width reduced total phosphorus losses by 16. 9 %. Results also highlighted the need to consider the impacts on multiple pollutants and the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures. According to model predictions, a catchment management based approach does have the potential to reduce <b>agricultural</b> diffuse <b>water</b> pollution, the risk of water quality non compliance and the subsequent need for raw water treatment. Overall, this thesis contributes to the development of effective strategies to mitigate <b>agricultural</b> diffuse <b>water</b> pollution...|$|R
