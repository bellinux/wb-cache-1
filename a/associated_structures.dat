5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and <b>associated</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|E

30|$|Hu [2] gave {{an example}} {{illustrating}} that NSD {{does not imply}} NA, and Hu posed an open problem whether NA implies NSD. Christofides and Vaggelatou [5] solved this open problem and indicated that NA implies NSD. Negatively superadditive dependent structure {{is an extension of}} negatively <b>associated</b> <b>structure</b> and sometimes more useful than negatively <b>associated</b> <b>structure.</b> Moreover, we can get many important probability inequalities for NSD random variables. For example, the structure function of a monotone coherent system can be superadditive [3], so inequalities derived from NSD can give one-side or two-side bounds of the system reliability. The notion of NSD random variables has wide applications in multivariate statistical analysis and reliability theory.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the mine}} was so productive, it was {{necessary}} for the company to build its own facilities at Morwellham Quay to handle the ore. Between 1856 and 1858, the mining company built its own Great Dock and quay at Morwellham. The company had built its railway with an incline for its last half-mile to the quay at Morwellham. Cars were lowered two at a time onto the incline where the power to move them on came from a steam engine. They passed through a tunnel and onto viaducts built on the quay. After the mine's closure, the track was removed and the tunnel infilled; this was partially restored in 2007. The engine house and <b>associated</b> <b>structures</b> survive, as does the incline.

25|$|The {{arthropod}} head {{problem has}} until recently been {{predicated on the}} Articulata theory, i.e. that the arthropods and annelids are close relatives. Although arthropods are essentially direct developers that do not possess a trochophore-like larva, the annelids do. During annelid metamorphosis, segments are added close to the posterior of the body, behind the mouth; whereas the brain {{is derived from the}} episphere or region in front of the mouth. Recognition of this led to the concept of a primary, non-segmental component of the body in annelids known as the acron being developed, from which the brain is ultimately derived. Because the arthropod and annelid heads, {{in the light of the}} Articulata theory, were assumed to be structurally homologous in some way, the arthropod head was also often considered to incorporate a non-segmental acronal component. Taking the homology between annelid and arthropod heads at face value, Swedish workers such as Hanström and Holmgren assumed that a large part of the arthropod head must correspond to the acron, a view followed later by several prominent American insect workers such as Butt and Snodgrass. They proposed that all pre-oral structures in insects were non-segmental, although such a view is at odds with the preoral position of apparently bona fide appendages such as the antennae. A less extreme set of theories propose that only the protocerebrum and <b>associated</b> <b>structures</b> should be considered to be acronal.|$|E
