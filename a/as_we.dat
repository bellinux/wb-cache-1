5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{have started}} to {{discover}} extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it.|$|E

5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu <b>as</b> <b>we</b> called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that life <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for life <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E

5|$|In applied mathematics, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> {{have done}} here, the delta {{function}} is often manipulated {{as a kind}} of limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending to zero.|$|E

5|$|Shaktism <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know {{it began}} with the {{literature}} of the Vedic Age; further evolved during the formative period of the Hindu epics; reached its full flower during the Gupta Age (300-700 CE), and continued to expand and develop thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Shiva <b>as</b> <b>we</b> {{know him}} today shares many {{features}} with the Vedic god Rudra, and both Shiva and Rudra {{are viewed as}} the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, {{the god of the}} roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.|$|E

5|$|So long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|The Hindi poet Mahadevi Verma said {{commenting on}} Tulsidas {{that in the}} {{turbulent}} Middle Ages, India got light from Tulsidas.

25|$|Ancient Greek mathematicians {{calculated}} {{not with}} quantities and equations <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do today, but instead they used proportionalities {{to express the}} relationship between quantities. Thus the ratio of two similar quantities {{was not just a}} numerical value, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> think of it today; the ratio of two similar quantities was a primitive relationship between them.|$|E

5000|$|Differentiation of {{two parts}} of the village began in the 15th century. Marklowice Górne was first {{mentioned}} in 1467 <b>as</b> <b>wes</b> wrchnye Marklowycze and then in 1950 <b>as</b> <b>wes</b> Horny Marklowicze. More distinctly in the 17th century the village was split into the two parts, Marklowice Dolne and Marklowice Górne. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The two municipalities were subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. They were joined together again {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|R
