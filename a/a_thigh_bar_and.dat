50|$|The {{white-banded swallow}} is a {{medium-sized}} swallow, measuring, on average, 15 cm and weighing 12 - 16 g. They {{usually have a}} wingspan of 92 - 108 mm. They decline in size from north to south, {{but this is a}} gradual decline, which suggests that there is no geographical variation. It is black, except for the band on its breast, its <b>thighs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bars</b> on the edge of its wings, which are all white. It also has blackish-brown underwing coverts. Their feathers have a blue-black luster. This swallow has a deeply forked tail. The sexes are similar, although the females weigh slightly more on average (12 - 14 g for the males, 12.8 - 15.8 g for the females). The juveniles are noted to be duller and browner, with shorter and paler feathers.|$|R
50|$|The male has the {{forehead}} and crown with the crest brilliant yellow; the whole upper plumage, {{sides of the}} head and neck, chin, throat, and breast deep black glossed with green, the edges of the feathers of the upper plumage with a metallic lustre, and the outermost tail-feathers tipped with white; lower plumage from the breast downwards deep yellow, the <b>thighs</b> <b>barred</b> or mottled with white. The recumbent crest is raised when the bird is alert or alarmed.|$|R
50|$|Northern {{goshawks}} {{are sometimes}} mistaken for species even {{outside of the}} Accipiter genus especially as juveniles of each respective species. In North America, four species of buteonine hawk (all four of which are smaller than goshawks to a certain degree) may be confused with them on occasion despite the differing proportions of these hawks, which all have longer wings and shorter tails relative to their size. A species so similar it is sometimes nicknamed the “Mexican goshawk”, gray hawk (Buteo plagiatus) juveniles (overlapping with true goshawks in the southwest United States into Mexico) have contrasting face pattern with bold dusky eye-stripes, dark eyes, <b>barred</b> <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bold white “U” on the uppertail coverts. The roadside hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) (rarely in same range in Mexico) is noticeably smaller with paddle shaped wings, <b>barred</b> lower breast <b>and</b> a buff “U” on undertail coverts in young birds. Somewhat less likely to confused despite their broader extent of overlap are the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) which have a narrow white-barred, dark-looking tail, bold white crescents on their primaries and dark wing edges and the broad-winged hawk (Buteo playpterus) which also has dark wing edges and a differing tapered wing shape. Even wintering gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) juveniles have been mistaken for goshawks and vice versa on occasion, especially when observed distantly perched, but have many tell-tale falcon characteristics like pointed, longer wings, a brown malar stripe {{as well as its}} more extensive <b>barring</b> both above <b>and</b> below.|$|R

The adult of the nominate subspecies, Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis, has a blackish-brown crown and upper neck while {{the sides of}} the neck and a broad collar are a dark rufous-brown. The feathers {{on the top of the}} head are slightly pointed, giving this species a hint of a crest. The remaining upperparts are a dark chocolate brown. The cheeks are light brown while the throat is buffy white with streaks. The eyes are large and dark brown or grey in females and yellow in males while the beak is short but deep. It also has a black median streak. The bird's underparts are white with variable amounts of rufous wash and a number of large, round blackish spots. The serpent eagle's <b>thighs</b> are <b>barred</b> sepia-brown <b>and</b> white, while the undertail is white. The underwing is largely white with some black spots and brown coloration. The tail is light brown, with five to six broad black bars. The claws are short and sharp, while the legs are yellow. Sexes are similar, though the female averages about three percent larger than the male. Immatures have a white crown and mantle, while the upper back has rounded brown or black spots that vanish as the bird ages. The wings and tail are greyish-brown and paler than those of the adults and are more darkly barred.|$|R

This study utilised data generated from impacts on human volunteers and cadaver material to select a surrogate soft tissue component for <b>a</b> <b>thigh</b> model.
