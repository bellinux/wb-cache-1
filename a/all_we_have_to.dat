25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and {{voted in favor of}} this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E
2500|$|... "Friendship with Jesus Christ" [...] is a {{frequent}} theme of his preaching. He stressed that on this intimate friendship, [...] "everything depends." [...] He also said: [...] "We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history." [...] Thus, in his book Jesus of Nazareth, his main purpose was [...] "to help foster [...] {{the growth of a}} living relationship" [...] with Jesus Christ.|$|E
2500|$|If Shakespeare {{had been}} a {{slightly}} more important person during his lifetime, {{at least as important}} as Ben Jonson, history would have provided us with more details about his life. But Shakespeare was not {{at the top of the}} social ladder, he was little more than a parasite of contemporary magnates. Nor did he belong to the great minds of his time. He was too uneducated to achieve such a position, as it is known. The romantic ideas according to which Shakespeare was a great wit, a great historian or a great thinker, are nowadays completely rejected [...] Today, it is evident that Shakespeare was first of all a true dodger of his era. He used the various materials from history or from the contemporary circumstances in England in order to create attractive theatrical masterpieces. First of <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> understand that Shakespeare never thought of theatre as literature. The theatre was a dangerous and slightly indecent institution, which every respectful and truly honored member of the society would rather avoid.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{directed}} by Bronwen Hughes from a script by Jeff Eastin. Hughes had previously directed an episode of Burn Notice, and would later go on to direct the pilot of Fairly Legal, another USA Network original series. For the pilot, the cast was joined by special guest star Diahann Carroll, who portrayed June, an elderly woman who allows Neal to stay in her home. Additional guest stars included Sharif Atkins as Clinton Jones, an agent working under Peter Burke. Denise Vasi guest starred as June's granddaughter Cindy, while Alexandra Daddario made a small appearance as Neal's disappearing girlfriend, Kate Moreau. Carroll, Atkins, Vasi, and Daddario would all become recurring guests. The final additions to the cast were Mark Sheppard as Curtis Hagen, Michael Gaston as Thompson, and Stephen Singer as Vincent. The episode was filmed on location in New York City. [...] "One {{of the best things}} about New York is [...] <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is open a door or point a camera at a window, and we've got absolutely brilliant production value," [...] Eastin stated.|$|E
2500|$|The navy's assault {{involved}} 400 {{sailors and}} marines in 25 boats. The operation was a fiasco {{from beginning to}} end. [...] Poor reconnaissance, planning, and communication all characterized the operation. Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr., commanding the monitor Patapsco, was placed {{in charge of the}} assault. When Commander Stevens protested that he [...] "knew nothing of [...] organization [...] " [...] and [...] "made some remonstrances on this grounds and others." [...] Dahlgren replied, [...] "There is nothing but a corporal's guard [...] in the fort, and <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is go and take possession." [...] This underestimation of the Confederate forces on Dahlgren's part may explain why he was hostile to a joint operation wishing to reserve the credit for the victory to the navy. Less than half of the boats landed. [...] Most of the boats that did land landed on the right flank or right gorge angle, rather than on the gorge where there was a passable breach. The Union sailors and marines who did land could not scale the wall. [...] The Confederates fired upon the landing party and as well as throwing hand grenades and loose bricks. The men in the boats that had not landed fired muskets and revolvers blindly at the fort, endangering the landing party more than the garrison. The landing party took shelter in shell holes in the wall of the fort. In response to a signal rocket fired by the garrison, Fort Johnson and the Confederate warship CSS Chicora opened fire upon the boats and landing party. The boats that could withdraw withdrew and the landing party surrendered. The Union casualties were 8 killed, 19 wounded, and 105 captured (including 15 of the wounded). The Confederates did not suffer any casualties in the assault.|$|E

60|$|Yes, {{there before}} us {{stretched}} the Promised Land, and there rose the mystic Mount, so that <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{do was to}} march down the snow slopes and enter it where we would.|$|R

"Frightful roads; {{short of}} victual, short of drink: nor was that <b>all.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> undergo {{a variety of}} accidents; and {{certainly}} our equipage {{must have had a}} singular air, for in every new place we came to, they took us for something different.|$|R
60|$|Of course all {{danger was}} now past. The roaring torrent soon forced {{its way into}} its own bed again, and <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to repair damages {{as well as we}} could, and make {{ourselves}} as comfortable for the night as circumstances would admit of.|$|R

60|$|I, on {{the other}} hand, was in favour of {{following}} the road we knew, which, although long and very wearisome, was comparatively safe, as in that vast desert there were few people to attack us, while Oliver, our captain, listened <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, and reserved his opinion.|$|R

5000|$|This is, for Weil, an {{original}} kenosis ("emptiness") preceding the corrective kenosis of Christ's incarnation (cf. Athanasius). We are thus {{born in a}} sort of damned position not owing to original sin as such, but because to be created at <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be precisely what God is not, i.e., <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be the opposite of what is holy. (See Apophatic theology.) ...|$|R

60|$|That is {{just the}} way with Memory; nothing that she brings to us is complete. She is a willful child; all her toys are broken.

6000|$|Isabel's indignation was {{checked by}} {{a sort of}} melancholy {{amusement}} at her brother's view, but Louis doubted whether she realized {{the weight of her}} own words as she answered--'Unfortunately, Walter, it is nearly <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live upon.' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{recall that}} when this sample came to me by express, I had my first and only {{conviction}} that my financial worries were over. Even Zulime was impressed with my brother's smelter reports which gave the proportion of gold to the ton, precisely set down in bold black figures. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to ship {{a sufficient number of}} car lots for the year and our income would rival that of Carnegie's.|$|R
