5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits <b>and</b> <b>limbs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs <b>and</b> <b>limbs.</b> Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E
40|$|This was a co-relational {{study done}} to {{determine}} the relationship of H-reflex with leg length <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length in Indian population.

H-reflex of all the subjects having leg length between 27 to 49 cm <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length ranging from 75 - 99 cm was recorded. Correlation was derived between H-reflex latency and leg length & H-reflex latency <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length using Karl Pearson formula.

5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds, brown above and white below. They have thin pointed downcurved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves on vertical tree trunks <b>and</b> <b>limbs.</b> One species has been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk <b>and</b> <b>limbs.</b> Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E

40|$|It is {{more than}} a decade since {{scientists}} are making use of sympathetic skin response (SSR) as a clinical and research method to evaluate sympathetic nervous system. A major portion of the efferent pathway of this response is composed of non-myelinated nerves. Thus, the latency of the response may be significantly different in normal individuals with different height <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> lengths. This study was designed to investigate the effect of these parameters on the SSR results. We measured the height <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length of 65 normal individuals with different heights (divided into 3 groups of height ≤ 150 cm, 150 - 170 cm, and ≥ 170 cm). The participants had neither peripheral nor central neuropathy. They also had none of the exclusion criteria. Then, they underwent SSR testing of both palms and soles. The correlation between the height <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length in relation to SSR parameters (latency and amplitude) was analyzed statistically by Pearson’s correlation. No significant correlation was detected between the height <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length <b>and</b> the SSR amplitude. However, the results showed significant correlation between SSR latency recorded from all four sites (both palms and soles) and the height of participants. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between SSR latency recorded from any <b>limb</b> <b>and</b> the length of that limb. Regarding the significant effect of the height <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length on the SSR latency, both the height <b>and</b> <b>limb</b> length should be considered when interpreting the results of SSR...|$|R

5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them to save their lives in {{a process known as}} autotomy. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone {{at the base of the}} tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E

5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso <b>and</b> <b>limbs.</b> The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E
5|$|Treves {{dissected}} Merrick's {{body and}} took plaster casts {{of his head}} <b>and</b> <b>limbs.</b> He took skin samples, which were later lost during the Second World War, and mounted his skeleton, which remains in the pathology collection at the Royal London Hospital. Although the skeleton has never been on public display, {{there is a small}} museum dedicated to his life, housing some of his personal effects.|$|E
5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck <b>and</b> <b>limbs,</b> and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E

5|$|Also {{developed}} by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Game Gear and Master System ports {{are similar to}} the Game Boy port, but in color instead of in monochrome. Both of them are almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with the addition of Kintaro. The arena where players fight Jade and Smoke is exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, but was drastically reduced in quantity when compared to other ports. Because of the systems' limited graphical resources, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent's body, leaving generic gibs of bones <b>and</b> <b>limbs,</b> while others were also simplified to use common animations.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a number of small posterns. The heads <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} spine, <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), {{and it may have}} stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E

The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes <b>and</b> <b>limbs,</b> but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} text-based {{graphics}} and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has {{to set in}} motion a process which generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventure mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised <b>and</b> <b>limbs</b> getting severed.|$|E
