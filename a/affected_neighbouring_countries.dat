5000|$|In 2016, anti-Filipino {{sentiment}} exists {{within the}} Confederation of Indonesian Worker's Unions (KPSI) organization after the recent kidnappings of Indonesian citizens by Sulu-based terrorist group, Abu Sayyaf. A protest {{was held by}} a group of Indonesian protesters of KPSI when they gathered in front of the Philippine Embassy in Indonesia, holding banners that read [...] "Go to hell Philippines and Abu Sayyaf" [...] and [...] "Destroy the Philippines and Abu Sayyaf" [...] to demanding more action from the Philippine government to fighting terrorism in their country which has since <b>affected</b> <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E
40|$|In August 2006, {{bluetongue}} virus (BTV) was {{detected in the}} Netherlands, Belgium, western Germany, Luxembourg and northern France for the first time. Consequently, a longitudinal entomological {{study was conducted in}} the affected region of northern France (Ardennes) throughout the autumn of 2006. Data on the spatio-temporal distribution of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) associated with livestock were collected and an attempt was made to identify the vector(s) involved in BTV transmission by means of virus detection in wild-caught biting midges. Weekly sampling using standardized Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps were performed simultaneously both outdoors and indoors in one BTV-free and three BTV-affected farms between September and December 2006. Culicoides were sorted according to farm, location (outdoors vs. indoors), time point (in weeks), species and physiological stage. BTV detection was conducted by RT-PCR on monospecific pools of non-bloodfed parous female Culicoides. The principal results showed: (i) the absence of the Mediterranean vector, C. imicola, (ii) the relatively low abundance of C. dewulfi and C. pulicaris, (iii) the widespread occurrence and abundance of C. obsoletus/C. scoticus with longevity and behaviour compatible with BTV transmission, and (iv) all Culicoides pools tested for BTV were negative. In France, the very low levels of BTV- 8 circulation were probably due to the limited introduction of the virus from <b>affected</b> <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries,</b> and not due to the absence of local vector populations. A key finding has been the substantiation, for the first time, that Culicoides, and particularly the potential vectors C. obsoletus/C. scoticus and C. dewulfi, can be active at night inside livestock buildings and not only outside, as originally believed. The endophagic tendencies of members of the Obsoletus group are discussed in light of the prolonged period of BTV transmission during the autumn of 2006 and the risk of BTV overwintering and resurgence in the spring of 2007. Overall, there is an urgent need to improve our knowledge on the ecology of local Culicoides species before any clear, effective and reliable recommendations can be provided to the veterinary authorities in terms of prevention and control...|$|E

50|$|In {{the middle}} of 1997 forest fires burning in Indonesia began to <b>affect</b> <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries,</b> {{spreading}} thick clouds of smoke and haze to Malaysia and Singapore. Then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad searched desperately for a solution, and based on a plan {{by the head of}} the Malaysian fire and rescue department sent a team of Malaysian firefighters across to Indonesia under code name Operation Haze. This is to mitigate the effect of the Haze to Malaysia economy. The value of the Haze damage to Malaysian GDP is estimated to be 0.30 per cent. Seasonal rains in early December brought a brief respite but soon after the dry conditions and fires returned. By 1998 Brunei {{and to a lesser extent}} Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines had also felt the haze from the smoke of the forest fires. By the time the 1997-98 forest fires were finally over some 8 million hectares of land had burned while countless millions of people suffered from air pollution.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2015, {{meetings}} were held {{with the aim}} to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in Libya. The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table {{to find a solution}} of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the [...] "Tobruk Camp", but also the [...] "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within Libya has steadily increased, <b>affecting</b> also <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries.</b> The terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum on 18 March 2015, was reportedly carried on by two Libyan-trained militants.|$|R
40|$|Last year Kaliningrad {{became the}} subject of an {{international}} debate involving first of all the European Union, Russia, the USA, and the countries bordering the enclave, Poland and Lithuania. Such keen interest in a small region of less than a million inhabitants was mainly {{due to the fact that}} Kaliningrad has found itself in the very centre of two processes which are of paramount importance for Europe: EU and NATO enlargement. If Lithuania becomes a member of those units and Poland joins the EU, this Russian enclave will become an island surrounded on all land borders by a totally different, political, economic and military entity. In the course of the debate many questions were raised about the situation in the Oblast and how it <b>affects</b> <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries,</b> the real interests and intentions of the parties involved in the debate, and the future of the region. The authors of this publication are attempting to answer these questions. The first part of this analysis is devoted to presenting the most important internal problems of the enclave, considering their influence on the surrounding world and the consequences of adopting the acquis communautaire in Poland and Lithuania. The second part characterises Moscow's policies towards Kaliningrad on the one hand, and those of Western countries on the other. Finally, the authors discuss the probable ways in which the situation in the enclave will develop...|$|R
40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) is {{a potentially}} fatal vector-borne zoonotic disease, {{which has become}} an increasing public health problem in the north-western part of Iran. This work presents an environmental health modelling approach to map the potential of VL outbreaks {{in this part of}} the country. Radial basis functional link networks is used as a data-driven method for predictive mapping of VL in the study area. The high susceptibility areas for VL outbreaks account for 36. 3 % of the study area and occur mainly in the north (which may <b>affect</b> the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries)</b> and South (which is a warning for other provinces in Iran). These parts of the study area have many nomadic, riverside villages. The overall accuracy of the resultant map was 92 % in endemic villages. Such susceptibility maps can be used as reconnaissance guides for planning of effective control strategies and identification of possible new VL endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|The South and Central Asia {{region is}} home to several features, such as the {{proliferation}} of trans-national radical groups with global agenda. Together {{with the presence of}} nuclear weapons, it emerges currently as the main threat for the international community {{after the end of the}} Cold War. The current chaos in Afghanistan is the most evident symptom of this complex situation; however, the deep causes of instability in the area cross boundaries and <b>affect</b> all the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries</b> in the region. According to this, the war in Afghanistan cannot be fought without taking in account the need to seek stability in the whole area. In this context, Pakistan is placed at the frontline of the war on international terrorism...|$|R
30|$|The Aid Worker Security Database {{on which}} the paper draws is subject to several limitations. The first {{involves}} the country’s specific nature of the data collection. The data shows the number of attacks within countries where aid workers operate but does not easily capture regional dynamics. Threats which originate in a context where aid workers are not present may impact where and how aid agencies operate in <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries</b> {{to the point of}} forcing evacuations. In this case, due to lack of presence, and therefore incidents, neither context would appear to be dangerous. The second limitation is that data collection only reflects attacks on aid workers and not others. This would not be relevant except that non-aid worker security incidents can negatively <b>affect</b> <b>neighbouring</b> contexts where aid workers do work. Both of these aspects are explored in more detail in the first case study.|$|R
