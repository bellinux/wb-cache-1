5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill</b> broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill</b> during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E

25|$|Still {{the term}} was largely unknown until the early 1990s when <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill</b> {{witnessed}} and testified against Supreme Court of the United States nominee Clarence Thomas. Since Hill testified in 1991, the number of sexual harassment cases reported in US and Canada increased 58 percent and have climbed steadily.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the postseason, CBS' {{coverage}} of the ALCS meant {{that they could not}} carry the live testimony of Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation to the United States Supreme Court was put into question because of charges of sexual harassment from former staffer <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill.</b> Meanwhile, ABC, NBC, CNN and PBS all carried the testimony.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the early}} hearings, NPR's Supreme Court {{correspondent}} Nina Totenberg received a leaked Judiciary Committee/FBI report that a former colleague of Thomas, University of Oklahoma law school professor <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill,</b> accused him of making unwelcome sexual comments to her when the two worked together at the Department of Education (DOE) and EEOC. In the same FBI report, Thomas testified that he had once promoted Allyson Duncan over Hill as his chief of staff at the EEOC.|$|E

25|$|Feminist {{communication}} theorists {{are also}} concerned with attempting {{to explain the}} methods used by those with power to prohibit women like Maria W. Stewart, Sarah Moore Grimké, and Angelina Grimké, and more recently, Ella Baker and <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill,</b> from achieving a voice in political discourse and consequently being driven from the public sphere. Theorists in this vein are also interested in the unique and significant techniques of communication employed by these women {{and others like them}} to surmount some of the oppression they experienced.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{confirmation}} hearings, sexual harassment allegations by <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill,</b> a law professor who had previously worked under Thomas at the United States Department of Education and then at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), were leaked to the media from a confidential FBI report. The allegations led to a media frenzy and further investigations. Televised hearings were re-opened and held by the Senate Judiciary Committee before the nomination was moved to the full Senate for a vote. Thomas was confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Thomas {{for a seat}} on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He {{served in}} that role for 16 months and on July 1, 1991, was nominated by Bush to fill Marshall's seat on the United States Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed attorney <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill,</b> a subordinate at the Department of Education and subsequently at the EEOC. The U.S. Senate ultimately confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{young women}} {{coalesced}} in an unorganized collective response to several women's issues, {{such as the}} Christian Coalition's Right to Life attack on legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill's</b> accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

Mayer and Abramson say Biden abdicated control of the Thomas confirmation hearings and did not call Angela Wright to the stand. They report that four women traveled to Washington, D.C., to corroborate <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill’s</b> claims, including Wright and Jourdain.|$|R

500|$|On October 12, 1991, {{breaking}} news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings {{was once again}} mindful of his audience, prefacing {{the coverage of the}} Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. [...] "You may hear some not very nice language," [...] said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill,</b> [...] "have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together...You can ask your parents to tell you more." [...] Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions, a forum on racism in April 1992.|$|E

50|$|Approximately a {{third of}} My Grandfather's Son is spent {{discussing}} Thomas's nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court. Thomas says he was initially reluctant to become a Justice, but that when President George H. W. Bush asked him he felt obliged to accept. When the hearings began on September 1, 1991, Thomas expected them to center on race and claims to have had no advance information about <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill's</b> accusations. My Grandfather's Son goes through the hearings day by day, with Thomas defending himself against his accusers and criticizing their motives. Thomas says he learned of the accusations of sexual harassment by Hill over the weekend after the first five days of the hearings when a pair of FBI agents visited his home.|$|R

50|$|While Murray set out {{to raise}} the {{necessary}} funds, two other women several hundred {{miles to the south}} in California began work on their own Senate campaigns. As a result, on January 3, 1993, {{for the first time in}} American history, California became the first state in the nation to be represented in the Senate by two women. In the 1992 elections, Dianne Feinstein, a former Democratic mayor of San Francisco, running for the balance of an uncompleted term, beat her opponent with a margin of nearly two million votes, while Barbara Boxer—a 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives who had joined six of her Democratic women colleagues in a march on the Senate to urge greater attention to <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill's</b> charges—solidly won a full term.|$|R
2500|$|In that volume, Brock {{would claim}} that he was pushed into the book {{assignment}} by what his publisher and agent wanted, {{but in any case}} the clear expectation was {{that it would be a}} takedown in the style of his writings on <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill</b> and Bill Clinton. [...] To fulfill this goal Brock hired what he has termed a [...] "small brigade of researchers" [...] to assist him.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{testified that}} the accusations against him were false and that, [...] "I deny each and every single {{allegation}} against me today that suggested {{in any way that}} I had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill,</b> that I ever attempted to date her, that I ever had any personal sexual interest in her, or that I in any way ever harassed her." ...|$|E

With respect to Thomas, Byrd stated that he was offended by Thomas' use of the phrase [...] "high-tech lynching of uppity blacks" [...] in his defense and that he was [...] "offended by the injection of racism" [...] into the hearing. He called Thomas' comments a [...] "diversionary tactic" [...] and said [...] "I thought we were past that stage."

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{evidence}} of gender-based vicarious sensitivity to disempowering behavior in organizations, expanding the concept of hostile working envi-ronment beyond the context of sexual harassment. Male and female graduate and undergrad-uate students viewed 10 video segments of <b>Anita</b> <b>Hill’s</b> interview by U. S. senators during the October 1991 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Nominee, Clarence Thomas. Although no significant relationship was found between the personal attributes of age and ethnicity to perceptions of disempowering behavior, female participants reported seeing significantly more offensive behavior in the video segments than did male participants. The results are discussed in terms of greater female sensitivity to common forms of disempow-ering behavior in organizations, and having a disparate negative impact and systematically placing women at a disadvantage in today’s workforce.
