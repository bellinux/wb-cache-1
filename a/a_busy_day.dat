5|$|After four years, {{the story}} {{presents}} tax attorney Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) on <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day.</b> He is getting {{married to the}} daughter {{of one of the}} richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington (Haviland Morris) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in the well-being of her fiancé. Loudon, on the other hand, has a number of duties entrusted to him by his boss (and future father-in-law), Mr. Worthington (John McMartin). First he has to pick up a cougar for an exotic animal activist named Montgomery Bell (John Mills), then to pick up Nikki, and lastly he has to make sure that Nikki catches the next bus to her hometown of Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|During a 1910s {{excavation}} for a sewer pipe, {{stones were}} unearthed that were suspected {{to be from}} the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day.</b> However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.|$|E

25|$|After his {{retirement}} from playing international rugby, Don-Wauchope kept his {{connections with the}} sport {{when he became a}} referee. He first officiated an international match in 1889 when he took charge of the Home Nations Championship encounter between Wales and Ireland. It had been <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day</b> for Don-Wauchope, as he had spent the morning chairing a meeting of the International Rugby Board. He went on to referee another two international games, in 1890 and 1893.|$|E
25|$|Practice summary: A {{total of}} 32 drivers took laps on <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day</b> of practice. Favorable weather {{conditions}} saw heavy action, with 1,799 laps completed. Andretti Autosport cars again topped the speed chart, with Marco Andretti setting the fastest lap thus {{far in the}} month. No incidents were reported. Rookie Conor Daly, who missed rookie orientation due to competing in Spain, completed his three-phase rookie test in the morning. In addition, Pippa Mann completed a refresher test.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} 1797–1801 Burney wrote three comedies {{that were not}} to be {{published}} in her lifetime: Love and Fashion, <b>A</b> <b>Busy</b> <b>Day</b> and The Woman Hater. The last is partly a reworking of subject-matter from The Witlings, but with the satirical elements toned down and more emphasis placed on reforming her characters' faults. The play, first performed in December 2007 at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, UK, retains one of the central characters, Lady Smatter – an absent-minded but inveterate quoter of poetry, perhaps meant as a comic rendering of a Bluestocking. All the other characters in The Woman Hater differ from those in The Witlings.|$|E

All eight of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels {{traditionally}} rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from UB-10, and sunk with explosives.|$|E
500|$|... 19 September was <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day</b> for Division 11 in the Gulf of Thailand with [...] encountering a junk that {{fired on}} her and when unable to escape tried to ram the cutter. The Viet Cong crew jumped {{overboard}} and Point Glover disabled the junk's engine with machine gun fire. A boarding party from Point Glover boarded the sinking junk and did a quick search of the vessel, finding arms and ammunition. Unable to stop the junk from sinking, she was beached in shallow water while , and [...] went searching for the missing junk crew; however, only one crew member was captured. Later that night Point Marone attempted to stop an unlit junk near the coastal town of Ha Tien but the junk ignored a warning shot across her bow and attempted to evade boarding while firing at the cutter and throwing hand grenades. Point Glover was nearby and assisted Point Marone in engaging the junk with machine gun fire. The junk caught fire and started sinking. Unable to keep the junk afloat the cutter crews marked it with a buoy and let it sink in shallow water. Salvage operations conducted later found rifles, ammunition, hand grenades, documents and money. Eleven Viet Cong {{were killed in the}} action and one badly wounded crewman was captured ashore.|$|E
500|$|With the {{transfer}} window reopening in January, Danny Wilson's first signing was {{the return of}} former loan player Marcus Williams who agreed a {{two and a half}} year deal. [...] The New Year started disappointingly as the Blades crashed to their first defeat since the beginning of November as they were beaten 3–2 at Carlisle United. Following Danny Wilson being awarded 'League One Manager of the Month' for December, United soon got back to winning ways when they returned to home soil. [...] The team saw off Salisbury City 3–1 in the third round of the FA Cup, the first meeting ever between the two clubs, and then outclassed Yeovil Town a few days later, hitting four without reply including a brace from Lee Williamson and a first ever club goal from captain Michael Doyle. With Danny Wilson looking to freshen up his squad United rewarded four of its younger players with contract extensions, with Erik Tønne and David McAllister set to remain with the club until the summer of 2014, and youth team players Jordan Chapell and Jack Adams agreeing new deals {{until the end of the}} season. In <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day</b> the club saw the departure of Elian Parrino as his short term deal came to an end, and then allowed McAllister to join League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a months loan, with manager Danny Wilson bemoaning a lack of reserve games under the current system. [...] The following week Wilson continued to overhaul the squad with reserve keeper Mihkel Aksalu leaving the club on mutual terms, but was boosted by 'fans favourite' James Beattie agreeing a deal to remain at Bramall Lane until the end of the season. Meanwhile, back in the league the Blades then continued their fine run of form, completing their second league double of the week, as they hit three without reply away at Bury, but that form deserted them for a top-of-the-table trip to Charlton Athletic where a bad tempered match resulted in both teams being reduced to ten men and a 1–0 loss for United. [...] Seven days later United suffered their first back-to-back defeats of the season as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of Birmingham City. With {{the transfer}} window about to close Bramall Lane was relatively quite on deadline day; Danny Philliskirk was handed an extended deal, and striker Will Hoskins signed on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion until the end of the season, whilst youngster Erik Tønne was allowed to join Yorkshire neighbours York City, also until the end of the season. The club also gave a trial to experienced Scottish defender David Weir with a view to a potential short term contract.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term honky-tonk is unknown.

[...] While the General Slocum was a large vessel, [...] similar sized wooden boats were on Puget Sound and the Columbia River (for example, Alaskan, Olympian, and in particular Yosemite, which routinely boarded more than 1,000 passengers), where on <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>day</b> or a crowded excursion such a death toll could have occurred.
