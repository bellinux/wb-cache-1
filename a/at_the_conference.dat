5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, {{so there was}} little for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference,</b> but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder of}} their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E

Led by quarterback John Talley and star halfback Ron Burton, the team beat Michigan again and won a match-up in October against Notre Dame, a school Northwestern had not played since 1948.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held {{a peace conference}} in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry would finally marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir. Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> and gave formal homage to Philip {{in front of the}} assembled nobles.|$|E

5|$|A major talking point <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford {{shortly before the}} conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference.</b> While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them.

The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia.

5|$|Between 23 and 27 September 1830, heavy {{fighting}} {{took place between}} Dutch forces and Brussels revolutionaries, who were reinforced by small contingents from across the country. The Dutch were eventually forced to retreat. In {{the aftermath of the}} failed attack and concurrent mass desertions of Belgian soldiers from the Dutch army, the revolution spread around Belgium. Dutch garrisons were pushed out of the area, until only Antwerp and Luxembourg remained occupied. The Provisional Government of Belgium, led by Charles Rogier, was formed on 24 September and Belgian independence was officially proclaimed on 4 October while work began on creating a constitution. In December, international governments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> of London recognized the independence of Belgium and guaranteed its neutrality. The Dutch, however, only recognized Belgium's independence and the terms of the Conference in 1839 and the Dutch-Belgian frontier was only fixed by the 1843 Treaty of Maastricht.|$|E
