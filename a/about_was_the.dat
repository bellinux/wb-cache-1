25|$|Full {{preparations}} for the 2003 contest began on 18 May 2003 at the Skonto Hall. There were rehearsals, press conferences and participants were also involved in an internet chat. Two dress rehearsals were held on 23 May, {{in front of an}} estimated 12,000 people. The organisers of the contest held a press conference; one of the issues complained <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lack of invitations for the after-party. The final dress rehearsal was held on 24 May, the day of the contest. A simulation of the voting procedure was also held, in which the presenters linked up with all twenty-six countries by satellite for the first time.|$|E
500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake. However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew. The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene. One issue that the production team was [...] "particular" [...] <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sound of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.|$|E

Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing we had heard <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. That sounded like a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just as Harris {{appeared}} {{poised to}} join the first ranks of Broadway stars, she stopped appearing on stage after The Apple Tree, except for the off-Broadway first American production of Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny in 1970, in which she {{played the role of}} Jenny, originally created by Lotte Lenya. In the 2002 interview, Harris said, [...] "Who wants to be up on the stage all the time? It isn't easy. You have to be awfully invested in the fame aspect, and I really never was.

[...] The album was influenced by Carlton's breakup with its co-producer, Stephan Jenkins, and Carlton said {{that one of the reasons}} they remained friends was that [...] "nothing took precedence over the music ... No matter what was going on in the emotional realm, all we cared <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> album. It created this kinetic environment that was kind of like Fleetwood Mac.

2500|$|All her {{information}} {{came from}} friends whose conversation leaned sharply {{away from their}} relatively high incomes, which, apparently, they found to be embarrassing {{in a world that}} harbored poor people. Their chosen method of being helpful was to attend meetings at one another's homes and discuss the problems of the hungry hordes after dinner. I am not trying to be amusing; it's what they really did. A Party member was usually invited to lead the discussions. I was apolitical.

2500|$|As {{with all}} emotions, saudade {{has been an}} {{inspiration}} for many songs and compositions. [...] "Sodade" [...] (saudade in Cape Verdean Creole) is {{the title of the}} Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora's most famous song. Étienne Daho, a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. The Good Son, a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as saudade. He told journalist Chris Bohn: [...] "When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> memory of things that I thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was saudade. It's not nostalgia but something sadder." ...|$|E

And, if I have succeeded in my task, the reader will by now have become aware that {{he was a young man}} with the gall of an Army mule. His conscience, if he had ever had one, had become atrophied through long disuse. He had given this sensitive girl the worst fright she had had since a mouse had got into her bedroom at school. He had caused Jno. Peters to totter off to the Rupert Street range making low, bleating noises. And did he care? No! All he cared <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fact that he had erased for ever from Billie's mind that undignified picture of himself as he had appeared on the boat, and substituted another which showed him brave, resourceful, gallant. All he cared <b>about</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fact that Billie, so cold ten minutes before, had allowed him to kiss her for the forty-second time. If you had asked him, he would have said that he had acted for the best, and that out of evil cometh good, or some sickening thing like that. That was the sort of man Samuel Marlowe was.|$|E
