5000|$|The news of {{controversy}} surrounding a celebrity {{would be a}} definite source of noise and it alters the message a brand is trying to convey. Consumers would already have specific connotations and personal views on the celebrity after negative news about them has surfaced, which would consequently directly affect that same consumer's image of the company. This {{is known as the}} term ‘Source-related Thoughts' where the source significantly sways the thoughts of the receiver. It has been said that [...] "If consumers find a particular spokesperson annoying or untrustworthy, {{they are less likely to}} accept what this source has to say…Receivers who react favourably to the source generate favourable thoughts, or source bolsters." [...] (Belch, G. E., & Belch, M. A. (2012).) This would mean that if a company chose to market their brand using a celebrity they would have to make sure their target market would appeal to this person as they develop feelings for the consumer regardless of the brand their product. Therefore, there would no use in using a youthful teenaged movie star to endorse an <b>anti-wrinkle</b> <b>cream</b> or a very misogynistic politician to promote a campaign to women - people would not be in favour to trust or like the business because they dislike or do not relate with the celebrity spokesperson representing it. Choosing a celebrity in which a business' target market will appeal to will convey and carry on the message effectively.|$|E

40|$|Manufactured {{nanomaterials}} ’ are particles made to haveextremely small {{dimensions in}} order to leverage theunique physical properties that chemicals can exhibit at the nanoscale. One nanometer (nm) is one thousandth of a mi-crometer (m), one millionth of a millimeter (mm) and one billionth of a meter (m). Put more simply, 1 nm is roughly 100, 000 times smaller than {{the width of a}} human hair. Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide now used in some sunscreens can measure 20 - 30 nm in size or even smaller in at least one dimension. The physical and chemical properties of these and other nanoscale materials, such as reactivity, persistence, or bioavailability, can differ significantly from their larger scale counterparts. However, changes in properties like these can often result in unpredictable changes in toxicity that as yet are not well-understood. Nanomaterials are already being used (unlabelled) in hundreds of consumer products including sunscreens and cosmetics Our review of consumer products has found that nanomaterials have entered a wide variety of personal care products on the market, in-cluding deodorant, soap, toothpaste, shampoo, hair conditioner, sun-screen, <b>anti-wrinkle</b> <b>cream,</b> moisturizer, foundation, face powder...|$|E
40|$|Flower extract of Caesalpinia pulcherrima {{possesses}} {{an impressive}} anti-oxidant activity. In this study, we examined {{safety of the}} <b>anti-wrinkle</b> <b>cream</b> containing the flower extract by means of skin irritation tests on rabbit skin (N = 7) and human skin (N = 30). This formulated cream was oil-in-water type containing 0. 5 % Caesalpenia flower extract. Safety was evaluated based on the Primary Irritation Index (PII). The results showed that in rabbit the cream was safe as the erythema and edema reactions at 24 –hr observations were relatively low in rabbit, and somewhat negligible in human. All reactions disappeared at 72 -hr observations. In human we found that our 0. 5 % Caesalpenia cream either with or without Aloe vera extract was safe as only 2 subjects reported slight itching on their skin sites applied with the herbal cream without Aloe vera extract. No rash was observed on any formulation. Since the cream with Aloe vera extract exhibited a somewhat lower irritancy than did the one without Aloe vera, the 0. 5 % Caesalpenia cream with Aloe vera extract may have a potential for further development for cosmetic products...|$|E

40|$|Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan, HA) is {{a linear}} {{polysaccharide}} formed from disacharide units containing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and glucuronic acid. HA {{is present in}} almost all biological fluids and tissues. In many cancer cells there is an upregulation of CD 44, a receptor that binds HA. The receptor CD 44 collocates hyaluronan in the special way. The bioconjugates built-up from the cytotoxic substances and hyaluronan are called prodrugs. The prodrugs {{can be used for}} targeted drug delivery system. Their main advantage is {{there is no need to}} medicine so high doses of pharmaceuticals and their adverse side effects are minimized. Hyaluronan can be used as well as the intra-articulation injection by osteoarthritis. HA is also used as the nutrition of joints, by treatment for diverse dermatic lesions, the repair of scars and it can be the ingredient of eye drops and nasal sprays. The cosmetic manufactures add HA into <b>anti-wrinkle</b> <b>creams</b> and anti-aging care...|$|R
40|$|Walnuts grow {{on large}} trees, {{known for their}} beauty, timber and tasty edible nuts. There are many {{varieties}} of walnuts that vary in hardiness, nut size and thickness of the nut shell. When {{it comes to their}} health benefits, Walnuts definitely are not hard nuts to crack. They contain free radical scavenging compounds like ellagic acid, juglone and certain phytosterols that support the immune system and appear to have anti-cancer properties. Walnuts have higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids including α-Linolenic acid, than do other nuts which may give walnuts additional anti-atherogenic and cosmetic value. It was found in clinical trials that walnut consumption in the amount of two to three servings per day consistently decreased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Linolenic acid and Linoleic acids present abundantly in walnuts are crucial for maintaining skin functions such as regulation of transepidermal water loss and anti- inflammatory action. The beneficial action of walnut oil on skin is known for centuries and is widely used in cosmetic industry. The walnut oil is a component of dry skin <b>creams,</b> <b>anti-wrinkle</b> and anti-ageing products as it possesses moisturizing property as well as free radical scavenging capacity. Besides, they also exhibit anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-stress, anti-ageing and Hepatoprotective activities. “Walnuts are better than cookies, french fries or potato chips, when you need a snack” as they provide rich nutrients. In the light of above, we thought it worthwhile to compile an up-to-date review article on Walnuts covering its synonyms, phytoconstituents, phytopharmacology and medicinal uses...|$|R
