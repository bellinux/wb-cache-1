We show that interleukin- 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increase urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> production, reinforcing the concept that increased urokinase production is associated with inflammatory processes.

40|$|The {{activation}} of the proteolytic plasminogen <b>activator</b> system {{is important for the}} re-epithelialization of skin wounds. Keratinocytes synthesize and secrete the urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator,</b> which binds to its specific receptor on keratinocytes. Receptor-bound urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> efficiently activates cell surface bound plasminogen. This results in pericellular proteolysis, which facilitates keratinocyte migration. Urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> activity is specifically controlled by plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 and - 2. As retinoids have been reported to accelerate epithelialization of skin wounds in animal studies and clinical settings, we investigated the effects of all-trans retinoic acid on the plasminogen <b>activator</b> system in human epidermal keratinocytes. As tested in a chromogenic plasminogen activation assay, incubation with 10 [*]µM all-trans retinoic acid caused a marked induction of cell-associated plasminogen activity after 24 [*]h, and this induction was blocked by neutralizing anti-urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> antibodies, but not anti-tissue-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> antibodies. All-trans retinoic acid lead to a strong increase in urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> receptor cell surface expression (flow cytometry) after 24 [*]h. At this time-point, tissue-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> and plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 and - 2 proteins were not or only slightly increased. Northern blot analyses revealed that all-trans retinoic acid caused an early and short-lived increase of plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1, but a prolonged induction of urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> and urokinase-type plasminogen <b>activator</b> receptor mRNA levels. Collectively, these data suggest that all-trans retinoic acid activates the plasminogen <b>activator</b> system in human epidermal keratinocytes by differentially regulating activating and inhibiting components.

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric <b>activators.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{urokinase}} plasminogen <b>activator</b> system plays {{a central}} role in malignant tumour progression. Both tumour hypoxia and enhancement of urokinase plasminogen <b>activator,</b> urokinase plasminogen activator-receptor and plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor type 1 have been identified as adverse prognostic factors. Upregulation of urokinase plasminogen <b>activator</b> or plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor type 1 could present means by which hypoxia influences malignant progression. Therefore, the impact of hypoxia on the expression pattern of the urokinase plasminogen <b>activator</b> system in rat DS-sarcoma in vivo and in vitro was examined. In the in vivo setting, tumour cells were implanted subcutaneously into rats, which were housed under either hypoxia, atmospheric air or hyperoxia. For in vitro studies, DS-sarcoma cells were incubated for 24 [*]h under hypoxia. Urokinase plasminogen <b>activator</b> and urokinase plasminogen activator-receptor expression were analysed by flow cytometry. Urokinase plasminogen <b>activator</b> activity was measured using zymography. Plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor type 1 protein levels in vitro and in vivo were examined with ELISA. PAI- 1 mRNA levels were determined by RT–PCR. DS-sarcoma cells express urokinase plasminogen <b>activator,</b> urokinase plasminogen activator-receptor, and plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor type 1 in vitro and in vivo. The urokinase plasminogen <b>activator</b> activity is enhanced in DS-sarcomas compared to normal tissues and rises with increasing tumour volume. The oxygenation level has no impact on the urokinase plasminogen <b>activator</b> activity in cultured DS-sarcoma cells or in solid tumours, although in vitro an increase in plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor type 1 protein and mRNA expression after hypoxic challenge is detectable. The latter plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor type 1 changes were not detectable in vivo. Hypoxia has been demonstrated to contribute to the upregulation of some components of the system in vitro, although this effect was not reproducible in vivo.

Plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 activity, plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 antigen, tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 complex, plasma clot lysis time, β-thromboglobulin and plasma platelet count were analysed. Platelet α-granule release (plasma β-thromboglobulin) showed a significant association with plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 antigen levels but weak associations with plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 activity and a functional marker of fibrinolysis, clot lysis time. Upon dividing the study population into quartiles based on β-thromboglobulin levels, plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 antigen increased significantly across the quartiles while plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor- 1 activity and clot lysis time tended to increase in the 4 th quartile only.
