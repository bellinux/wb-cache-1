[...] He went on to comment that the novel only [...] "offers the frustrated Bond addict... a small academic problem, of swiftly passing interest." [...] The Daily Mirrors reviewer, Alexander Muir considered the book to be [...] "an exciting, violent, sadistic and sexy piece of reading matter", although, partly because of Amis' abilities as a writer, Colonel Sun [...] "is altogether too meticulous and well written – Fleming was a hypnotic but slapdash writer.

500|$|Southerton's tour report {{refers to}} the crowds' {{reactions}} to the England team, and in particular to the [...] "barracking" [...] of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger. In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, [...] "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that [...] "it was a bit too thick <b>at</b> <b>times...</b> <b>I</b> got called every name you can imagine, and every four-letter word you can think of was used against me". The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). <b>At</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

Particular contributions are, first, the focus upon both targets and perpetrators of workplace bullying, and second, the two-wave design with a 6 -month time lag. We assume that (a) workload <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> associates positively with being a target/perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, (b) job autonomy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> associates negatively with being a target/perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, and (c) the positive relationship between workload <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> and being a target/perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 is stronger under the condition of low (vs. high) job autonomy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> (i. e., interaction between workload and job autonomy). Moderated hierarchical regression analyses (N = 320) revealed lagged main effects for being a target, and interaction effects for being a perpetrator. In particular, <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> workload was positively and <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> job autonomy negatively associated with being a target <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. Job autonomy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> reduced the positive relationship between workload <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> and being a perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{mathematical}} optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying {{a decision by}} breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of value functions V1, V2, ..., V'n, with an argument y representing {{the state of the}} system <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>i</b> from 1 to n. The definition of V'n(y) is the value obtained in state y at the last time n. The values V'i at earlier times i=n1,n2,...,2,1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation. For i=2,...,n, V'i1 at any state y is calculated from V'i by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time i1 and the function V'i at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since V'i has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields V'i1 for those states. Finally, V1 at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.|$|E

This broom was destroyed by the Whomping Willow during a match in Harry's third year. It was replaced by a Firebolt, an even faster (and more expensive) broom, purchased for Harry by Sirius; however, as Sirius was believed to be trying to murder Harry at the time, the broom was subjected to stringent security inspections before Harry was allowed to ride it. Harry used it throughout his Hogwarts career until it, along with Hedwig, was lost during the July escape from Privet Drive in the final book.|$|E
