50|$|Jan Jongbloed wore number 8 {{because some}} of the players {{who had been in the}} Dutch squad at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, where the Netherlands used a purely <b>alphabetical</b> <b>numbering</b> system, were given the same numbers again in 1978. Hugo Hovenkamp withdrew from the squad before the tournament began, but after the {{deadline}} for naming replacement players had passed. The Netherlands thus went to the World Cup with only 21 players.|$|E

In the first part is theoretically described substance of neural networks and concretically described principle the method of learning multiple-layer network with backward spreaded error(a. ka Backpropagation). Basic problematic of processing the picture and resilence of network against degradation picture by a noise and compression JPEG is also described here. Second part is directed to practical realization of feed foward multiple-layer network with recognition the binary patterns of <b>alphabetical</b> letters and <b>numbers</b> 0 to 9, which was created in Matlab and Simulink environment.

40|$|This {{resource}} {{manual of}} ideas for incorporating functional literacy applications into student lessons {{is intended for}} volunteers trained to teach one-to-one in adult literacy programa and for teachers of adult students. The ideas are designed to increase beginning student exposure to and familiarity with functional literacy materials. It provides relevant reading materials while reinforcing basic skills development. Introductory materials discuss use of the book, teaching of functional literacy, materials needed, and definitions of important terms. The chapters are arranged by topics. Each topic contains sample lessons or lesson suggestions. Topics include names and sounds of letters, key words for the sou of letters, sight words in rear life reading materials, vowel decoding, <b>alphabetical</b> order, <b>numbers,</b> number words, yariation on language experience, reading "everything, " using the Bible or they religious material as teachingltools, family reading, and lit racy and employment.

30|$|The {{structure}} of the texts within the codices may be described with the mechanism pair ordinatio/compilatio. 19 A palaeographical examination of the nine codices reveals that the various scribes did not use any particular visual devices to organise {{the material in any}} specific way. Ordinatio’s indexes, numeral or in <b>alphabetical</b> order, marginal <b>numbers</b> or glosses are all features of an efficient textual mise-en-page. Nevertheless, these elements are missing in our codices, {{with the exception of the}} London, British Library, Add. 41486 manuscript (see [38], p. 43). The texts of the eight remaining codices are provided in a continuous progression, in which recipes are marked by their title only, sometimes with differently coloured ink, and without any comments in the pages’ margins. A discontinuous alpha-numerical thematic order is rarely present.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the most}} {{registered}} number plate {{series in the}} country, the W series' traditional 7-character format became the first in Peninsular Malaysia to be exhausted when WYY 9999 was reached on 26 September 2013. To allow further W plates, the algorithm was altered to feature an alphabetical suffix behind the number sequence, resetting at W 1 A. When W 9999 Y was achieved, the second alphabetical sequence emerged between the state prefix and number sequence, leading to WA 1 A. When WA 9999 Y is met, the first alphabetical sequence will reset and the second alphabetical sequence will advance, giving WB 1 A. When WY 9999 Y is reached, a third new alphabetical sequence will be spliced into the algorithm, between the second <b>alphabetical</b> sequence and <b>number</b> sequence, resulting in WAA 1 A. The series will end when WYY 9999 Y is reached. The new format would theoretically allow a vastly larger number of registered plates, better addressing the risk of exhaustion of numbers, but is also subject of conflicts with a certain series of Singaporean number plates (see Malaysian vehicles in Singapore) ...|$|R
5000|$|SWA (pronounced swǒ) {{the band}} {{originally}} {{started as a}} concept defined by Chuck Dukowski, former bassist of Black Flag {{while he was still}} a member of that band. The name (which is pronounced like [...] "Swah" [...] and not [...] "S-W-A") was created by assigning an <b>alphabetical</b> value to <b>numbers</b> on a gaming die, then rolling the die three times. Dukowski would later claim that the name was offered up by Joe Carducci and was accepted {{by the rest of the}} band, despite Chuck's own discomfort with it. [...] SWA has had the dubious distinction of being considered the [...] "worst" [...] band to ever record for SST Records by many label aficionados and, in one infamous fanzine article, Steve Albini claimed that among the worst things a person could do was [...] "listen to SWA" [...] and [...] "be SWA". [...] However, others have come to the band's defense. [...] The band existed from the mid 1980s until 1992 and released 5 full-length albums on SST Records, all of which are currently out of print.|$|R

The Prime Minister's Department had its origin in 1904 as a Prime Minister's Office in the Department of External Affairs and was created on 1 July 1911. The primary function of the Department was in providing advice and guidance to the Prime Minister and the government on the whole range of Commonwealth activities: policy issues and government relations internationally with State governments, with interest groups and individuals. A central thread was the requirement that the Department advise the Prime Minister on all submissions coming to Cabinet. On 12 March 1971, the Prime Minister's Department was abolished and it was replaced by an amalgamation of this department and the Department of the Cabinet Office to form the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet...|$|R
