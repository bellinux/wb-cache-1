5|$|Adhyatma Ramayana tells that Kabandha was {{a fierce}} cannibal {{and his arms}} were eight miles long. His huge face – which had no eyes or ears – was <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He had no head or legs.|$|E
25|$|A Sizang, {{he was a}} very strong, {{tall and}} {{masculine}} individual who possessed an unusual body structure, measuring “9 tuuk” <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> (54inches diameter and 108inches of the chest circumference). Yet, because of his ability to move quickly, apparent body lightness despite its massiveness, and his athletic skills, the constant admiration was overwhelming. The description of his physical feature seems similar to the figure of Goliath in the Bible, 1 Samuel 17:4-7, Goliath was more than six cubits- about three meters tall, according to the Bible. Pu Tong Seal's dwelling place was Khuasak, Zogam (Chin State), northern Burma. His father-in-law at that time lived in Theizang but owned a plot at Khuakhuan, 'Khuasak'.|$|E
25|$|When in {{formation}} and standing, the color bearer keeps the military colors near his foot, holding {{his right hand}} down on the rod and his left hand on the rod, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> level. The rod's low end must {{be in front of}} his right foot. When saluting from this position, the military colors are bowed at horizontal for the Romanian President and other heads of state and at 45degrees for the other civil and military staff. When marching, the color bearer holds the military colors vertically. If the unit is walking more than 100m, the rod is introduced inside the scarf's muff. When traveling by vehicle, the color bearer with the military color stands inside the unit commander's car. During the march, the color bearer salutes by bowing the military colors at 45degrees, regardless the person. When two military units cross each other (either one or both of them are marching {{in formation}}) the military colors are bowed for salute at 45degrees. In case of raining, snowing or strong winds, the military colors are protected by a transparent plastic cover.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} 2000 {{transfer}} window, South African striker Sibusiso Zuma was signed from South African side Orlando Pirates, and in May 2000, English manager Roy Hodgson became the new manager. From the 2000–01 season, the club started to improve. The club won its second Superliga championship, winning 3–1 {{in the last}} New Firm derby match of the season, at the Parken Stadium. The 2–0 goal was a bicycle kick by Zuma, who received the ball <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> bounced {{it in the air}} and in the same motion executed the overhead kick, volleying the ball into the far corner out of Brøndby goalkeeper Mogens Krogh's reach. This was later voted the Danish goal of the year, and was voted the best Superliga goal of the decade in December 2009 and was in 2013 voted as the greatest moment in the history of FCK. Roy Hodgson broke his contract with Copenhagen a few weeks after having won the championship, signing with Italian team Udinese, and he was replaced by Swede Kent Karlsson. The 2001 season is also remembered for a highly dramatic event. During training on 13 March 2001 charismatic midfielder Ståle Solbakken suffered a heart attack. He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but {{on the way to the}} hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 August 1786, Nicholson {{approached}} the King as he alighted from a carriage at St. James's Palace on {{the pretext of}} presenting him with a petition, which was actually a blank piece of paper. As he received the supposed petition, she made two lunges <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> with an ivory-handled dessert knife before she was brought under control. George, apparently fearing {{that she would be}} unjustly handled for such a pitiful attack, was reported as saying [...] "The poor creature is mad; do not hurt her, she has not hurt me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 September 1864, Burton and Speke were {{scheduled}} to debate {{the source of the}} Nile {{at a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science. On the day before the debate, Burton and Speke sat near each other in the lecture hall. According to Burton's wife, Speke stood up, said [...] "I can't stand this any longer," [...] and abruptly left the hall. That afternoon Speke went hunting on the nearby estate of a relative. He was discovered lying near a stone wall, felled by a fatal gunshot wound from his hunting shotgun. Burton learned of Speke's death the following day while waiting for their debate to begin. A jury ruled Speke's death an accident. An obituary surmised that Speke, while climbing over the wall, had carelessly pulled the gun after himself with the muzzle pointing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and shot himself. Alexander Maitland, Speke's only biographer, concurs.|$|E
5000|$|The Godey's Lady's Book {{published}} {{an account of}} Hall engaging with George Washington {{during a visit to}} Pickering. Minardi wrote: [...] "While in camp, when Washington felt he needed exercises, Hall set up a sort of jump rope for him, fastening one end to a stake and holding the other taut <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>chest.</b> This anecdote gave an amusing picture of the nation's founding father engaged in play 'with true boyish zest.' It revealed little about Primus Hall, other than he seemed to be at General Washington's beck and call." ...|$|R
60|$|Etienne {{turned his}} weary {{eyes to the}} corner which was being {{indicated}} to him. There he saw a huge creature sprawling across a bench, with long, powerful limbs stretched out before him. Citizen Rateau was clothed, rather than dressed, in a soiled shirt, ragged breeches and tattered stockings, with shoes down at heel and faded crimson cap. His face looked congested and sunken about the eyes; {{he appeared to be}} asleep, for stertorous breathing came at intervals from between his parted lips, whilst every now and then a racking cough seemed to tear <b>at</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>chest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|William Walrond (1610-1667/9) (eldest son), who in 1637 married Ursula Specott (died 1698), {{daughter}} of Humphrey Specott of Launcells in Cornwall. Ursula was buried <b>at</b> Kentisbeare. <b>His</b> <b>chest</b> tomb exists in Bradfield Chapel, north aisle, Uffculme Church. He is {{shown on the}} left side in a relief bust below a cartouche with the Walrond arms. The arms above the relief bust figure on the right are those of Specott (Or, on a bend gules three millrinds of the first) and the ostensibly female person sculpted below, who seems to have acquired a beard and mustache, therefore appears to be Ursula his wife. Five standing female figures are shown, at the west end, a blindfolded Justice, also Faith Hope & Charity. The chest tomb is complete in itself, and the half-figures presently placed on top of it belong to a former now broken up monument, probably that of the reclining Sir William Walrond (died 1689), whose effigy now occupied the window-ledge above. On the top slab is inscribed: ...|$|R

60|$|Then he {{took off}} his own garment, made it up into a roll, lashed one end to the rope in the centre of Surajah's back, passed it between his legs and {{fastened}} it to the knot <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

6000|$|He slapped <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> {{as he sat}} on that bough, Singing [...] "Willow, titwillow, titwillow!" [...] And a cold {{perspiration}} bespangled his brow, Oh, willow, titwillow, titwillow!

60|$|However, {{on looking}} round {{to the bed}} she brightened, for she saw that Jude was {{apparently}} sleeping, though {{he was not in}} the usual half-elevated posture necessitated by his cough. He had slipped down, and lay flat. A second glance caused her to start, and she went to the bed. His face was quite white, and gradually becoming rigid. She touched his fingers; they were cold, though his body was still warm. She listened <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> All was still within. The bumping of near thirty years had ceased.|$|E
6000|$|And we three, strangely moved, {{could not}} take our eyes from him. He had become enigmatical and touching, in virtue of that mysterious cause that had driven him {{through the night and}} through the {{thunderstorm}} to the shelter of the schooner's cuddy. Not one of us doubted that we were looking at a fugitive, incredible as it appeared to us. He was haggard, as though he had not slept for weeks; he had become lean, as though he had not eaten for days. His cheeks were hollow, his eyes sunk, the muscles of <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and arms twitched slightly as if after an exhausting contest. Of course {{it had been a long}} swim off to the schooner; but his face showed another kind of fatigue, the tormented weariness, the anger and the fear of a struggle against a thought, an idea--against something that cannot be grappled, that never rests--a shadow, a nothing, unconquerable and immortal, that preys upon life. We knew it as though he had shouted it <b>at</b> us. <b>His</b> <b>chest</b> expanded time after time, as if it could not contain the beating of his heart. For a moment he had the power of the possessed--the power to awaken in the beholders wonder, pain, pity, and a fearful near sense of things invisible, of things dark and mute, that surround the loneliness of mankind. His eyes roamed about aimlessly for a moment, then became still. He said with effort-- ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryWe herein {{describe}} the first case, to our knowledge, of surgical biopsy-proven usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) as the pulmonary manifestation in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). A 56 -year-old male {{was admitted to}} our hospital because of the identification of bilateral reticular infiltrate on a chest roentgenogram. He was histologically confirmed to have PBC without definite signs of Sjögren's syndrome <b>at</b> age 47. <b>His</b> <b>chest</b> CT scan showed bibasilar reticular opacities without a honeycomb appearance, while a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis revealed no lymphocytosis. A surgical lung biopsy specimen revealed evidence of a UIP pattern. The patient's condition has remained stable for a follow-up period of two years without treatment. Our case indicates that the UIP pattern is an additional form of diffuse interstitial pneumonia/fibrosis that may develop in association with sporadic PBC...|$|R
60|$|With compunction tweaking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> Soames {{descended the}} stairs, where was always that rather {{pleasant}} smell of camphor and port wine, and house where draughts are not permitted. The poor old things--he had {{not meant to}} be unkind! And in the street he instantly forgot them, repossessed by the image of Annette and the thought of the cursed coil around him. Why had he not pushed the thing through and obtained divorce when that wretched Bosinney was run over, and there was evidence galore for the asking! And he turned towards his sister Winifred Dartie's residence in Green Street, Mayfair.|$|E
60|$|Things {{had come}} so easily {{to him for}} the last two years that he had taken his steady upward {{progress}} in life as assured. It had never occurred to him, when he went to intercept Ethel after that séance, that he went into any peril of that sort. Now he had had a sharp reminder. He began to shape a picture of the frog-like boy at home--he was a private student of the upper middle class--sitting in a convenient study with a writing-table, book-shelves, and a shaded lamp--Lewisham worked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> of drawers, with his greatcoat on, and his feet in the lowest drawer wrapped in all his available linen--and in the midst of incredible conveniences the frog-like boy was working, working, working. Meanwhile Lewisham toiled through the foggy streets, Chelsea-ward, or, after he had left her, tramped homeward--full of foolish imaginings.|$|E
60|$|But Uya, the old lion, was not abroad, but at home, and he lay very still, and {{a little}} on one side. He was not in his lair, but a little way from it {{in a place of}} trampled grass. Under one eye was a little wound, the feeble little bite of the first axe. But all the ground beneath his chest was ruddy brown with a vivid streak, and in his chest was a little hole that had been made by Ugh-lomi's stabbing-spear. Along his side and at his neck the {{vultures}} had marked their claims. For so Ugh-lomi had slain him, lying stricken under his paw and thrusting haphazard <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He had driven the spear in with all his strength and stabbed the giant to the heart. So it was the reign of the lion, of the second incarnation of Uya the Master, came to an end.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile, he {{continued}} {{the business of}} undressing, and <b>at</b> last showed <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face, his back, too, {{was all over the}} same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk! ...|$|R
60|$|His eyeball it gleamed like {{a furnace}} of coke; He boldly {{inflated}} his clothes as he spoke; He daringly {{felt for the}} corks on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> And he recklessly tightened the belt <b>at</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{on guard}} again!" [...] cried the young squire, and sprang {{in with a}} fire and a fury which {{more than made up}} for the {{shortness}} of his weapon. It had not escaped him that his opponent was breathing in short, hoarse gasps, like a man who is dizzy with fatigue. Now was the time for the purer living and the more agile limb to show their value. Back and back gave Tranter, ever seeking time for a last cut. On and on came Alleyne, his jagged point now at his foeman's face, now at his throat, now <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> still stabbing and thrusting to pass the line of steel which covered him. Yet his experienced foeman knew well that such efforts could not be long sustained. Let him relax for one instant, and his death-blow had come. Relax he must! Flesh and blood could not stand the strain. Already the thrusts were less fierce, the foot less ready, although there was no abatement of the spirit in the steady gray eyes. Tranter, cunning and wary from years of fighting, knew that his chance had come. He brushed aside the frail weapon which was opposed to him, whirled up his great blade, sprang back to get the fairer sweep--and vanished into the waters of the Garonne.|$|E

60|$|As he did so, all {{his limbs}} began {{to crack and}} stretch; he felt his head rising above his shoulders; he glanced down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> nose, and saw it grow smaller and smaller; <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back grew flat, and his legs grew long.|$|R
