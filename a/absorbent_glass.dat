5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of VRLA batteries, Sealed VR wet cell, AGM and Gel. Gel cells add silica dust to the electrolyte, forming a thick putty-like gel. These are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "silicone batteries". AGM (<b>Absorbent</b> <b>Glass</b> Mat) batteries feature fiberglass mesh between the battery plates which serves to contain the electrolyte. Both designs offer advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional batteries and sealed VR wet cells, as well as each other.|$|E
5000|$|A valve-regulated {{lead-acid}} battery (VRLA battery) sometimes called sealed lead-acid (SLA), gel cell, or maintenance free battery''''''. Due to their construction, the Gel and <b>Absorbent</b> <b>Glass</b> Mat (AGM) types of VRLA can be mounted in any orientation, {{and do not}} require constant maintenance. The term [...] "maintenance free" [...] is a misnomer as VRLA batteries still require cleaning and regular functional testing. They are widely used in large portable electrical devices, off-grid power systems and similar roles, where large amounts of storage are needed {{at a lower cost}} than other low-maintenance technologies like lithium-ion.|$|E

50|$|Combustion {{spraying}} equipment produces an intense flame, {{which may have}} a peak temperature more than 3,100 °C, and is very bright. Electric arc spraying produces ultra-violet light, which may damage delicate body tissues. Spray booths, and enclosures, should be fitted with ultra-violet <b>absorbent</b> dark <b>glass.</b> Where this is not possible, operators, {{and others in the}} vicinity should wear protective goggles containing BS grade 6 green glass. Opaque screens should be placed around spraying areas. The nozzle of an arc pistol should never be viewed directly, unless it is certain that no power is available to the equipment.|$|R

40|$|Monitoring blood {{coagulation}} while {{a patient}} is on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is critical in preventing clots from arising in the bypass machine and consequently being sent into the patient’s bloodstream. Current methods used to monitor blood coagulation such as Activated Clotting Time (ACT) yield results that do not correlate coagulation time to heparin or protamine dosage and will typically take at least 400 s to yield a result that is safe to initiate bypass. Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPAD) are advanced sensors based {{on a wide range}} of recently developed techniques for complex analytical methods. In this research, a point-of-care (POC) sensor was developed based on techniques adapted from lateral flow and µPAD. The effects of varied dosages of heparin and protamine were observed using this POC µPAD and an accompanying Raspberry pi-based monitoring device. Paper microfluidic channels were printed on nitrocellulose paper with a wax pattern. Human whole blood was added to an <b>absorbent</b> fiber <b>glass</b> sample pad preloaded with known amount of heparin or protamine. By having this absorbent pad on the inlet of the channel, the blood sample is able to travel through the channel via capillary flow. Significantly different (p < 0. 05) rates of flow between blood samples with different doses of heparin and protamine show that the device can monitor the extent of coagulation and patient-specific responses to each drug. Thus a low-cost device was built that monitors the extent of blood coagulation and allows for individualized dosing of heparin and protamine in as little at 20 s and no more than 180 s...|$|R

50|$|Two {{types of}} {{chemically}} absorbent tubes {{are used to}} sample {{for a wide range}} of chemical substances. Traditionally a chemical <b>absorbent</b> 'tube' (a <b>glass</b> or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10 mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lypophylic), is used in a sampling line where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period. The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lypophylic material absorbs non water-soluble materials. The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatograph or mass spectrometry methods. These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable {{for a wide range of}} potential contaminates. However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis. A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the sampling pump (up to 1 kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.|$|R
40|$|The {{automatic}} analysis {{system of}} a portable gas chromatograph {{was designed to}} measure the organic pollutants in urban air. This equipment was composed of three parts; PID-gas chromatograph unit (60 × 22 × 52 cm, 22 kg), integrator (Shimadzu CR 6 A, 8. 5 kg) and He bonbe (16 kg). Samples were automatically concentrated in the Tenax-GC glass tube by a vacuum pump, which is able to take 3 liters air for 12 minutes. After the carrier gas flowed in the <b>absorbent</b> <b>glass</b> tube, it reached suddenly to 210 ℃ within a minute. At the same time, ananalytical column (SPB- 1, Fused Silica Capillary 0. 32 mmφ× 25 m thick 1. 0 μm) was kept at 80 ℃.

40|$|State {{of charge}} (SOC) and {{state of health}} (SOH) are key issues for the {{application}} of batteries, especially the <b>absorbent</b> <b>glass</b> mat valve regulated lead-acid (AGM VRLA) type batteries used in the idle stop start systems (ISSs) that are popularly integrated into conventional engine-based vehicles. This {{is due to the fact}} that SOC and SOH estimation accuracy is crucial for optimizing battery energy utilization, ensuring safety and extending battery life cycles. The dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF), which provides an elegant and powerful solution, is widely applied in SOC and SOH estimation based on a battery parameter model. However, the battery parameters are strongly dependent on operation conditions such as the SOC, current rate and temperature. In addition, battery parameters change significantly over the life cycle of a battery. As a result, many experimental pretests investigating the effects of the internal and external conditions of a battery on its parameters are required, since the accuracy of state estimation depends on the quality of the information regarding battery parameter changes. In this paper, a novel method for SOC and SOH estimation that combines a DEKF algorithm, which considers hysteresis and diffusion effects, and an auto regressive exogenous (ARX) model for online parameters estimation is proposed. The DEKF provides precise information concerning the battery open circuit voltage (OCV) to the ARX model. Meanwhile, the ARX model continues monitoring parameter variations and supplies information on them to the DEKF. In this way, the estimation accuracy can be maintained despite the changing parameters of a battery. Moreover, online parameter estimation from the ARX model can save the time and effort used for parameter pretests. The validation of the proposed algorithm is given by simulation and experimental results...|$|E
