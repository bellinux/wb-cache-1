25|$|The City Council of Philadelphia funded a {{competition}} in 1895 {{to design a}} new museum building, {{but it was not}} until 1907 that plans were first made to construct it on Fairmount, a rocky hill topped by the city's main reservoir. The Fairmount Parkway (renamed Benjamin Franklin Parkway), a grand boulevard that cut diagonally across the grid of city streets, was designed to terminate at the foot of the hill. But there were conflicting views about whether to erect a single museum building, or a number of buildings to house individual collections. The architectural firms of Horace Trumbauer and Zantzinger, Borie and Medary collaborated for more than a decade to resolve these issues. The final design is mostly credited to two architects in Trumbauer's firm: Howell Lewis Shay for the building's plan and massing, and Julian <b>Abele</b> for the detail work and perspective drawings. In 1902, <b>Abele</b> had become the first African-American student to be graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Architecture, which is presently known as Penn's School of Design. <b>Abele</b> adapted classical Greek temple columns for the design of the museum entrances, and was responsible for the colors of both the building stone and the figures added to one of the pediments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Abele’s</b> {{research}} interests lie in physiological ageing in ectotherms, {{the evolution of}} genes and genomes, the impact of climatic changes on Antarctic coastal benthos, and HIF-1 homologs in marine organisms. In addition to her scientific papers, she has also published university course material as well as books.|$|R
25|$|This {{cylindrical}} {{design is}} only one class of designs that produce a uniform field inside a cavity within an array of permanent magnets. Other classes of design include wedge designs, proposed by <b>Abele</b> and Jensen, in which wedges of magnetized material are arranged to provide uniform field within cavities inside the design as shown.|$|E
25|$|Some Federal Circuit {{decision}}s, however, {{had held}} some transformations of signals and data patent-eligible. For example, the <b>Abele</b> decision approved a dependent {{claim to a}} method transforming X-ray attenuation data produced in a X-Y field by an X-ray tomographic scanner to an image of body organs and bones — {{while at the same}} time the <b>Abele</b> court rejected a more generic and abstract independent claim to a process of graphically displaying variances from their average values of unspecified data obtained in an unspecified manner. The court said that this kind of difference between the two claims was critical to patent-eligibility. The dependent claim, unlike the independent claim, involved signal data representing tangible physical objects, which were electronically manipulated to provide a screen image of the physical objects. But Bilski's process had nothing to do with such a procedure. Like State Street, Bilski involved manipulation of financial data.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} that tongue worms are crustaceans {{can be traced}} back to the work of Pierre-Joseph Van Beneden, who compared them to parasitic copepods. The modern form of this hypothesis dates from Karl Georg Wingstrand's study of sperm morphology, which recognised similarities in sperm structure between tongue worms and fish lice (Argulidae) – a group of maxillipod crustaceans which live as parasites on fish and occasionally amphibians. John Riley and colleagues also offered a detailed justification for the inclusion of the tongue worms among the crustaceans. The fish louse model received significant further support from the molecular work of Lawrence G. <b>Abele</b> and colleagues. A number of subsequent molecular phylogenies have corroborated these results, and the name Ichthyostraca has been proposed for a (Pentastomida + Branchiura) clade. Thus a number of important standard works and databases on crustaceans now include the pentastomids as members of this group.|$|E

50|$|<b>Abele's</b> brigade held {{long enough}} {{on the slopes of}} the hill for Leiningen and Piret to untangle and the Austrian brigades escaped to the east, leaving some 3000 men in killed, wounded and prisoners. The Prussians, having only engaged with 14 battalions, only lost about 300 men, but managed to link up their two armies and drive the Austrians and their Saxon allies out of their Iser line.|$|R
25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by <b>Abele</b> and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|E

In 1986, Joel W. Martin and <b>Abele</b> placed N.texanus and N.sayi in a separate genus, Dyspanopeus, reaffirming their close relationship. However, P.texana only occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, and can be distinguished from P.sayi by the form of the fifth pereiopod (last walking leg) and that of the male gonopod.|$|E

500|$|However, not all reviews were as positive. Robert <b>Abele</b> of LA Weekly {{thought the}} pilot was average, {{containing}} [...] "fashionable gore, occasionally witty dialogue, serviceable suspense and boilerplate police-department politics". <b>Abele</b> felt that the series was a superhero tale, rather than the dark comedy, police thriller and brooding drama that it was promoted to be. Brian Lowry of Variety {{did not think that}} Dexter would impress critics, and noted, [...] "antics of the deranged... aren't really all that pleasant to watch", but praised Hall's acting saying that he [...] "... quickly dispatches any thoughts of his [...] "Six Feet" [...] character, which, by itself, represents quite an accomplishment." [...] Nancy DeWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal felt that the [...] "grotesqueries of Dexter are not something that can easily be dismissed with the old 'you don't have to watch' line. We don't have to watch. We do have to live among the viewers who will be desensitized, or aroused, by this show".|$|E
500|$|Robbie Collin of The Telegraph {{called the}} film [...] "flamboyantly loathsome on every imaginable level" [...] and was {{critical}} of the three lead characters, saying [...] "unlike Superbads leads, these three are poisonously unpleasant, and the supposedly comedic banter between them comes off as bullying." [...] The Los Angeles Timess Robert <b>Abele</b> called the main trio [...] "numbingly predictable" [...] and the film itself [...] "unoriginal", stating the film [...] "bears a cravenly piggish attitude toward rewarding socially unacceptable behavior that feels unseemly rather than exciting".|$|E
500|$|There is less {{agreement}} {{on the status of}} the subclass Phyllocarida with its single extant order, Leptostraca, depending on whether foliaceous (leaf-like) limbs have a single or multiple origin. Some authors advocate placing Phyllocarida in Phyllopoda, a group used in former classification systems, which would then include branchiopods, cephalocarids and leptostracans. [...] A molecular study by American biologists Trisha Spears and Lawrence <b>Abele</b> concluded that phylogenetic evidence did not support the monophyly of this grouping, and that Phyllocarida should be regarded as a subclass of Malacostraca that had diverged from the main lineage at an early date.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commission}} for the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1916-28) was shared between Trumbauer's firm and Zantzinger, Borie and Medary. Trumbauer architect Howell Lewis Shay {{is credited with}} the building's plan and massing, although the perspective drawings {{appear to be in}} <b>Abele's</b> hand. When it opened in 1928, the building was criticized as being vastly overscaled and nicknamed [...] "the great Greek garage".

50|$|Having {{lost the}} engagements at Hühnerwasser and Podol, {{and with the}} Prussian Elbe army and 1st Army bearing in on them from {{the west and the}} north, Clam-Gallas and his ally, Prince Albert of Saxony, decided to have Iser Army abandon their exposed {{position}} near Münchengrätz. While three Austrian brigades, under Count Leiningen, remained to slow the Prussian pursuit, Clam-Gallas sent Ringelsheims's and Poschacher's brigades east towards Jičín, while the five Saxon brigades marched south to Jungbunzlau. Leiningen deployed his jäger in town and posted the line regiments from his own brigade across the Iser river in Klaster, Piret's brigade deployed on Musky Hill, and <b>Abele's</b> brigade drew up in battalion columns on the road from Podol.|$|R
50|$|After {{being beaten}} at Münchengrätz, Iser army under Clam-Gallas redeployed at Jičín. Unaware {{that after the}} Battle of Skalitz Benedek had halted North Army's advance towards Jičín, where under the Austrian battle plan the {{conjunction}} of both armies would {{have taken place in}} order to fall upon one of the Prussian main armies to beat them in detail, Clam-Gallas {{was under the impression that}} he would be directly supported by Northern army's advance units (III Corps), and decided to give battle. Clam-Gallas' battle line consisted out of <b>Abele's</b> brigade at the Privysin heights on the left, supported by Ringelsheim's brigade blocking the road from Münchengrätz at Lochov, the center at Brada Hill was held by Poschacher's brigade, supported by Leiningen's, and the town of Eisenstadtl on the right was to be held by Piret's brigade and the 1st Light Cavalry Division. The position between Poschacher and Piret was to be held by the Saxon army, which after taken a longer southern route from Münchengrätz had the previous night camped some 10 kilometers south of their designated position in the battle line, leaving a vulnerable gap between the Austrian center and right. The gap was temporarily filled by a 56 gun Austrian grand battery.|$|R

He praised characters Liz and Jack, saying they [...] "continued to provide laughs", but said Jenna and Tracy [...] "only continued to frustrate". Canning called Baldwin {{the best part of}} 30 Rock, and found that the series had [...] "laid essential groundwork for a successful situation comedy".

500|$|Duke {{students}} often {{refer to the}} campus as [...] "the Gothic Wonderland," [...] a nickname referring to the Collegiate Gothic architecture of West Campus. Much of the campus was designed by Julian <b>Abele,</b> {{one of the first}} prominent African-American architects and the chief designer in the offices of architect Horace Trumbauer. The residential quadrangles are of an early and somewhat unadorned design, while the buildings in the academic quadrangles show influences of the more elaborate late French and Italian styles. The freshmen campus (East Campus) is composed of buildings in the Georgian architecture style. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed Duke among the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This {{anthology}} addresses globalization {{with regard}} to the world of work. How can women pursue their career and enjoy equal opportunities in the labor market? How can employees be supported during the process of company acquisition? How can the existential crises of young adults that were triggered through institutional work experiences be met and coped with? How can violence among children and adolescents be prevented? Seventeen contributions in Petia GENKOVA's and Andrea E. <b>ABELE's</b> anthology provide answers to these questions. There are four chapters focusing on: 1. female employees and their career, 2. patterns of socialization, 3. self-socialization as a means of gaining basic competencies, and 4. diversity and political culture. A short description of the meaning of a hidden curriculum in times of globalization follows an introduction to the contents of the book and information about the authors. All articles included are then commented upon. It {{should be noted that the}} anthology contains a variety of themes and aspects regarding globalization as well as innovative and interactive research methods, although the qualitative methods applied are limited to participative observation and expert interviews. The weakness of the anthology is that due to the complex and abstract linguistic usage, the concepts have not been made sufficiently accessible and straightforward. URN: [URL]...|$|R

Robert <b>Abele</b> of LA Weekly complimented the program for being [...] "insanely watchable", while Varietys Brian Lowry criticized the storylines as being [...] "as old as they come". The second season garnered more favorable feedback, with Virginia Heffnernan of The New York Times opining that Conrad [...] "now registers as charm". After the falling-out between Conrad and Montag in the third season, Heffernan also commented that The Hills [...] "is more convincing than Friends and just about any other comedy about female relationships because — {{as anyone who has}} ever been a young woman knows — undying friendships die".|$|E

Though he praised the score, he stated that it is [...] "more fascinating for its ambitions than for what it accomplishes" [...] and criticised the main characters for being [...] "too shallow" [...] and unengaging. Robert <b>Abele</b> of the Los Angeles Times criticised the [...] "weak plot, forgettable dialogue and sloppy politics" [...] and called the lead characters [...] "empty-headed blanks". Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle called McNairy and Able a [...] "semi-interesting" [...] pair, but disliked the lack of monsters in the film, the dialogue, and the familiarity of the story. Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post called the film [...] "a less-than-compelling relationship drama", criticising it for being unoriginal and predictable, and that hiding the monsters made them less frightening.|$|E
500|$|John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{called the}} pilot [...] "splendidly made". However, Doyle {{considered}} the instance of Torv stripping to a bikini [...] "indulgent", and questioned {{the wisdom of}} making [...] "her body an object of scrutiny" [...] in the first episode. Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe wrote that [...] "after the electrifying start, Fringe unfolds as an uneven, unwieldy piece of work that provides very few chills and thrills". LA Weeklys Robert <b>Abele</b> found Fringe is [...] "a smorgasbord of a show, but one a little too synthetically engineered to allow you the chance to discover what it is". John Leonard of New York was skeptical of the premise and storyline, but found Torv [...] "wonderfully played" [...] her character. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com felt the plot was too over-the-top, and described Abrams as [...] "the ultimate boyish idiot-savant imaginator... He can't exercise a little self-restraint".|$|E
500|$|Robert <b>Abele</b> of LA Weekly {{said that}} [...] "in this smart, {{engaging}} series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way}} that stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making", [...] " [...] with promise". However, Press felt that the series paled somewhat compared to the television series Wonderfalls. Filip Vukcevic of IGN gave the season a positive review, particularly praising the amount of audience participation. However, the reviewer felt that several of the main characters were undeveloped, and that Daggs III and Dunn, as well as their respective characters, were [...] "boring". Vukcevic wrote that while the ultimate resolution to the murder was satisfying, it was not [...] "world-shattering".|$|E

But despite the mixed-positive reception, a number of critics have called the movie a ripoff of Goodfellas. Robert <b>Abele,</b> of the LA Times, said [...] "the film plays like an explosion's aftermath; shards of mob movies that add up to the usual Goodfellas knockoff". Scott Tobias, of the A.V.
