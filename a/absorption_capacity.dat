25|$|Minerals such as titanium, iron, and {{zirconium}} {{are commonly}} found in the soil and they, too, {{become part of the}} comb walls. The average dry weight of the nest is about 80.87 g. Cells in the paper comb are typically 4 to 5mm long and 8 to 9mm in diameter. Exact composition of nests in northern Turkey contained oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen as the main elements, while elements found in trace amounts were silicon, calcium, iron, and potassium, but no aluminum, magnesium, or sodium were detected, providing further evidence that European hornets use the surrounding soil as a resource in building their nests. The ratio of fibrous material to actual saliva affects the nest's ability to absorb water, thus how well the inside of the nest stays dry. In these same nests studied in Turkey, fiber content was 23% while 77% was hornet saliva. Just for these nests, the resulting water <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> turned out to be optimal: 100%.|$|E

While this property {{is common to}} many transition metals, palladium has a uniquely high <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> and does not lose its ductility until x approaches 1. This property has been investigated in designing an efficient, inexpensive, and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium, though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose.

The condiments were stored for 14 days at ambient temperature after the normal 72 h of fermentation and at 2 days interval assessed for pH, titratable acidity, free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide values (POV) as well as fat and water <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities.</b> The pH of both samples increased in the alkaline range, so also the titratable acidity. Peroxide values and FFA of the two condiments also increased significantly with storage, with those of soybean daddawa being significantly (p< 0. 05) higher. Water and fat <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> of the fermented products decreased with storage. Differences recorded in values of fat <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> was also significant (p< 0. 05).

2500|$|The {{structural}} role {{of cellulose}} in cell walls has been likened {{to that of}} the glass strands of fiberglass or to the supporting rods within reinforced concrete. Cellulose fibrils are highly insoluble and inelastic and, because of their molecular configuration, have a tensile strength comparable to that of steel. Consequently, cellulose imparts a unique combination of chemical resilience and mechanical support and flexibility to the tissues in which it resides. [...] Bacterial cellulose, produced by Acetobacter species, displays unique properties, including high mechanical strength, high water <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> high crystallinity, and an ultra-fine and highly pure fiber network structure. One of the most important features of bacterial cellulose is its chemical purity. In addition to this, bacterial cellulose is stable towards chemicals and at high temperatures. Bacterial cellulose has been suggested to have a construction like a ‘cage' which protects the cell from foreign material and heavy-metal ions, while still allowing nutrients to be supplied easily by diffusion. Bacterial cellulose was described by Louis Pasteur as [...] "a sort of moist skin, swollen, gelatinous and slippery." [...] Although the solid portion in the gel is less than one percent, it is almost pure cellulose containing no lignin and other foreign substances. Although bacterial cellulose is obtained {{in the form of a}} highly swollen gel, the texture is quite unique and different from typical gels. [...] Cellulose has a high swollen fiber network resulting from the presence of pore structures and tunnels within the wet pellicle. Plant cellulose water retention values 60%, while bacterial cellulose has a water retention value of 1000%.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the things}} that makes Digitaria exilis unique is its {{physicochemical}} properties. The physicochemical properties of Digitaria exilis can differ depending on if its starch is natural or succinylated. The pH of succinylated Digitaria exilis is lower than that of natural Digitaria exilis. This could be because some of the molecules introduced by succinylation resembled those of acetylation. While succinylation does decrease the pH of starch, it can increase some of its properties such as bulk density and water <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> The difference in bulk density is caused by the particle size decreasing as the bulk density increases. Succinylation increases the water <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> of the starch which indicates that it could be helpful in some food products such as dough.|$|E

40|$|Using {{laboratory}} {{cultures of}} algae and natural phytoplankton populations from Nhatrang Bay (South China Sea), {{the relationship between}} the chlorophyll fluorescence F 0, the chlorophyll a concentration C a and light <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> of algae cells was studied. It is shown that the ratio F 0 / C a depends mainly on the species composition of the algae population; hence, the concentration C a can be measured with the fluorescence method with acceptable accuracy only when the species composition of algae populations varies over a rather narrow range. The fluorescence F 0 can, however, be a good index of the total <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> of different phytoplankton species, because the intensity of F 0 depends on the sum total of light absorbed by all photosynthetic pigments in a plant cell. Thus, the fluorescence F 0 measures not only the concentration of chlorophyll a, but that of all photosynthetic pigment concentrations...|$|R

The design of photocatalysts with high electron-hole generation rates, high surface areas and high light <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> is crucial in producing sustainable and cost-effective photocatalytic processes. Titania, zirconia, copper oxide, zinc oxide, iron oxide are widely used photocatalysts which have good light <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> with moderate surface areas depending on the synthesis conditions. In the last decade metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used in photocatalytic applications due to their very high surface areas up to 1000 s of m 2 /g and adequate light <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities.</b> In this study zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) based MOF photocatalytsts were prepared and the effect of silver (Ag) doping on the photocatalytic activity of ZIF- 8 and ZIF-L crystals was investigated. Ag doped ZIF- 8 and ZIF-L crystals were prepared and their activities in the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB) dye under UV irradiation were determined {{for the first time in}} the literature. Doped ZIF- 8 and ZIF-L crystals showed better photocatalytic activities compared to the undoped crystals. 100 % of MB was removed with 5 mole% Ag+ doped ZIF- 8 in 40 min. The photocatalytic activity decreased beyond 5 % doping level since Ag+ ions may have segregated due to a possible solid state solubility limit of Ag+ ions in the crystal lattice of ZIF- 8.

40|$|The {{functional}} properties of flours derived from selected legumes were studied {{before and after}} dehulling of the germinated seeds. Ungerminated seeds were used as the control. The chosen legumes were green gram (Phaseolus aureus), cowpea (Vigna catjang), lentil (Lens culinaris) and bengal gram (Cicer arietinum). Dehulled samples had a higher protein solubility compared with germinated and control samples. The bulk densities of germinated and dehulled legume flours were lower compared to control. Germination increased water <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> of legume flours from 1226, 1285, 974 and 1362 g kg(- 1) to 1481, 1433, 1448 and 15 17 g kg(- 1) in green gram, cowpea, lentil and bengal gram, respectively. Fat <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> increased in germinated samples (1130, 1242, 920 and 837 g kg(- 1)) as against 900, 993, 857 and 788 g kg(- 1) at ambient conditions for green gram, cowpea, lentil and bengal gram, respectively. On dehulling, the fat <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> of samples were reduced and the differences were statistically significant. The emulsification capacities of control samples ranged from 5 5 to 193 ml oil emulsified per gram of sample. On germination and dehulling, the emulsification capacities, activities and stabilities of samples increased significantly. There were increases in foaming capacities and reduction in foam stabilities of all the samples investigated on germination and dehulling.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) structures require strengthening {{for numerous}} factors, such as increased load, {{modification of the}} structural systems, structural upgrade or errors {{in the design and}} construction stages. The side near-surface mounted (SNSM) strengthening technique with glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars is a relatively new emerging technique for enhancing the flexural capacities of existing RC elements. Nine RC rectangular beams were flexurally strengthened with this technique and tested under four-point bending loads until failure. The main goal {{of this study is to}} optimize the structural capacity of the RC beams by varying the amount of strengthening reinforcement and bond length. The experimental test results showed that strengthening with SNSM GFRP bars significantly enhanced the flexural responses of the specimens compared with the control specimen. The first cracking and ultimate loads, energy <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities,</b> ductility and stiffness were remarkably enhanced by the SNSM technique. It was also confirmed that the bond length of the strengthened reinforcement greatly influences the energy <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities,</b> ductility and stiffness.

50|$|The <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> for {{fructose}} in monosaccharide form {{ranges from}} less than 5 g to 50 g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake. Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities. When fructose is ingested {{as part of the}} disaccharide sucrose, <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the GLUT5 transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent cotransport of fructose.In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (>2.4 g/kg body wt) increase transport proteins within three days of intake.|$|E

The purpose of this report is to investigate the rate control mechanisms and the rate control performance capabilities of one implementation of the Xpress Transport Protocol (XTP) - SandiaXTP. The structure of SandiaXTP as a whole, and also more particularly its rate control mechanisms, are analysed with the help of Object Modeling Notation (O. M. T.). Some changes to the rate control algorithm are proposed, followed by the presentation and interpretation of 26 unicast and multicast rate control experiments done in a LAN environment.

40|$|International audienceVolatile organic {{compounds}} {{are a major}} source of air pollutants. Absorption is an effective solution to treat polluted air loaded with volatile {{organic compounds}}, but most actual absorbents are often toxic and non-biodegradable. Here, we tested eutectic solvent mixtures for the absorption of volatile organic compounds for the first time. The affinity of solvent mixtures for toluene, acetaldehyde and dichloromethane was determined by measuring vapour–liquid partition coefficients and liquid phase <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities.</b> Results show that the vapour–liquid partition coefficients vary, at 30 °C, from close to zero for acetaldehyde in the mixtures choline chloride:urea, choline chloride:glycerol and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide:glycerol to 0. 124 for dichloromethane in the choline chloride:urea eutectic mixture. These values are similar or even superior to those published for ionic liquids and organic solvents. Solvents based on choline chloride, a food additive, and urea, can solubilize up to 500 times more volatile organic compounds compare to water. Moreover, deep eutectic solvents are easier to prepare and more biodegradable than ionic liquids, which are also toxic. Deep eutectic solvents are more biodegradable than silicone oils, which are also expensive. Furthermore, in terms of recycling, the <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> of the tested solvents remained unchanged during five absorption–desorption cycles. These findings are patented...|$|R
