40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the additional diagnostic value of color mapping of the hepatic arterial enhancement fraction (AEF) for detecting recurrent or residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Materials and Methods: Seventy-six patients with 126 HCCs, {{all of whom}} had undergone previous TACE, and subsequently, underwent follow-up multiphasic liver CT scans, were included in this study. Quantitative color maps of the AEF of the whole liver were created, by using prototype software with non-rigid registration. The AEF was defined as the ratio of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>increment</b> during the arterial phase to the <b>attenuation</b> <b>increment</b> during the portal phase. Two radiologists independently analyzed the two image sets at a two-week interval, i. e., the multiphasic CT image set and the second image set of the AEF color maps and the CT images. The additional diagnostic value of the AEF color mapping was determined, by the use of the jackknife-alternative free-response receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. The sensitivity and positive predictive values for detecting HCCs of each image set were also evaluated and compared. Results: The reader-averaged figures of merit were 0. 699 on the initial interpretation of the MDCT image set, and 0. 831 on the second interpretation of the combined image set; {{the difference between the two}} interpretations was significant (p value < 0. 001). The mean sensitivity for residual or recurrent HCC detection increased from 62. 7 % on the initial analysis to 82. 1 % on the second analysis using the AEF color maps (p value < 0. 001). The mean positive predictive value for HC...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the linear stability of a hydrodynamic relativistic flow of magnetized plasma in the force [...] free approximation. We considered {{the case of}} light cylindrical jet in cold and dense environment, so the jet boundary remains at rest. Continuous and discrete spectra of frequencies are investigated analytically. An infinite sequence of eigenfrequencies is found {{near the edge of}} Alfvén continuum. Numerical calculations showed that modes are stable and have <b>attenuation</b> <b>increment</b> γ small. The dispersion curves ω =ω (k_∥) have a minimum for k_∥_ 0 ≃ 1 /R (R is the jet radius). This results in accumulation of perturbations inside the jet with wavelength of the order of the jet radius. The wave crests of the perturbation pattern formed in such a way move along the jet with the velocity exceeding light speed. If one has relativistic electrons emitting synchrotron radiation inside the jet, than this pattern will be visible. This provide us with the new type of superluminal source. If the jet is oriented close to the line of sight, than the observer will see knots moving backward to the core. Comment: 22 LaTeX pages, standard LaTeX article style, accepted by Mon. Not. Roy.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} local hyperthermia treatment for a variety of clinical applications. The desired therapeutic outcome in local hyperthermia treatment is achieved by raising the local temperature to surpass the tissue coagulation threshold, resulting in tissue necrosis. In oncology, local hyperthermia is used as an effective way to destroy cancerous tissues and is said to have the potential to replace conventional treatment regime like surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, the inability to closely monitor temperature elevations from hyperthermia treatment in real time with high accuracy continues to limit its clinical applicability. Local hyperthermia treatment requires real-time monitoring system to observe the progression of the destroyed tissue during and after the treatment. Ultrasound is one of the modalities that have great potential for local hyperthermia monitoring, as it is non-ionizing, convenient and has relatively simple signal processing requirement compared to magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. In a two-dimensional ultrasound imaging system, changes in tissue microstructure during local hyperthermia treatment are observed in terms of pixel value analysis extracted from the ultrasound image itself. Although 2 D ultrasound has shown to be the most widely used system for monitoring hyperthermia in ultrasound imaging family, 1 D ultrasound on the other hand could offer a real-time monitoring and the method enables quantitative measurement to be conducted faster and with simpler measurement instrument. Therefore, this paper proposes a new local hyperthermia monitoring method that is based on one-dimensional ultrasound. Specifically, the study investigates the effect of ultrasound attenuation in normal and pathological breast tissue when the temperature in tissue is varied between 37 and 65 Â Â°C during local hyperthermia treatment. Besides that, the total protein content measurement was also conducted to investigate the relationship between attenuation and tissue denaturation level at different temperature ranges. The tissues were grouped according to their histology results, namely normal tissue with large predominance of cells (NPC), cancer tissue with large predominance of cells (CPC) and cancer with high collagen fiber content (CHF). The result shows that the attenuation coefficient of ultrasound measured following the local hyperthermia treatment increases with the increment of collagen fiber content in tissue as the CHF attenuated ultrasound at the highest rate, followed by NPC and CPC. Additionally, the <b>attenuation</b> <b>increment</b> is more pronounced at the temperature over 55 Â Â°C. This describes that the ultrasound wave experienced more energy loss when it propagates through a heated tissue as the tissue structure changes due to protein coagulation effect. Additionally, {{a significant increase in the}} sensitivity of attenuation to protein denaturation is also observed with the highest sensitivity obtained in monitoring NPC. Overall, it is concluded that one-dimensional ultrasound can be used as a monitoring method of local hyperthermia since its attenuation is very sensitive to the changes in tissue microstructure during hyperthermia...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the behavior of light attenuation (PAR) in maize hybrids, cultivated under different population densities in narrow row spacing (0, 45 m). An experiment was installed to evaluate six hybrids (A 2555, A 2288, AG 9010, AG 6690, P 30 F 88 and Valent), cultivated in five plant densities (40, 53, 71, 84 and 97 thousand plants for hectare), in Goiânia, Goiás state, in the growing season 2002 / 2003. The experimental design was randomized blocks with split plot, arranged in a 6 x 5 factorial with four replicates. The interceptation of photossintetic active radiation was evaluated measuring photon flux density: above the canopy, in {{the height of the}} ear, and in soil surface. The results showed a positive correlation between grain yield and light <b>attenuation.</b> The <b>increment</b> on plant density in narrow row spacing resulted in a greater absorption of PAR, and consequently enhancements in grain yield. In these conditions, the results also showed that the light attenuation on maize canopy occurs in the superior part of the canopy, above the ear height...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{techniques}} {{provide the}} most reliable method of examining the geoacoustical properties of marine sediments. In the past, individual in situ surveys have only been able to examine compressional waves over a maximum frequency range of 100 Hz to 50 kHz. A new in situ acoustic device, the Sediment Probing Acoustic Detection Equipment, or SPADE, has been developed, which can emit a variety of pulses, e. g. tonal and swept-frequency, over a continuous frequency range of 10 - 100 kHz. Data from a recent field trial are analysed to obtain the in situ velocity and <b>attenuation</b> over frequency <b>increments</b> of 5 kHz between 10 - 75 kHz. Results imply that scattering is a dominant attenuation mechanism from 10 - 75 kHz and the media is dispersive for frequencies between 60 and 70 kHz and below 20 kHz. Biot theory cannot accurately model the observed velocity and attenuation. 1...|$|R
