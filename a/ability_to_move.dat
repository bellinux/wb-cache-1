5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds {{because they have}} less <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians having their populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|Dummy {{horses were}} {{sometimes}} used to deceive the enemy into misreading {{the location of}} troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns in their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E
50|$|MSL systems, whether virtual or {{physical}} in nature, {{are designed to}} preserve isolation between different classification levels. Consequently, (unlike MLS systems), an MSL environment has no innate <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> data from one level to another.|$|R

25|$|Some {{descriptions}} of the game do not limit this <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>moves</b> making a capture. However, most mention that these pieces have two types of move, ranging and range jumping, suggesting that the capture rule may have been mistakenly omitted.|$|R
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Iginla was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} NHL's most prominent power forwards. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from that point on he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
50|$|Cirronians are energy-based lifeforms that {{inhabit the}} planet Cirron in the Migar system. Cirronians have the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> at hyperspeed, which weakens them if used {{more than once}} a day; {{manipulate}} energy; heal; and telekinesis. They are weakened by the cold, prolonged exposure can be fatal. Their strength is increased by heat.|$|R

5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a right {{and that the government}} will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out of reach {{with the help of}} others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E
25|$|In sleep {{laboratory}} studies, nitrazepam decreased sleep onset latency. In psychogeriatric inpatients, it {{was found}} to be no more effective than placebo tablets in increasing total time spent asleep and to significantly impair trial subjects' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and carry out everyday activities the next day, and it should not be used as a sleep aid in psychogeriatric inpatients.|$|R
50|$|Also, on day five, mission specialists Mario Runco and Gregory J. Harbaugh {{spent nearly}} 5 {{hours in the}} open cargo bay {{performing}} a series of space-walking tasks designed to increase NASA's knowledge of working in space. They tested their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about freely in the cargo bay, climb into foot restraints without using their hands and simulated carrying large objects in the microgravity environment.|$|R
25|$|In December 1942 {{three of}} the class were loaned to the War Department, and saw service in Scotland where their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> heavy freight were needed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> troop trains and war {{materials}} over winding routes. These were considered a rarity amongst locomotive crews, and due to the customised inside valve gear, the regulators worked in a different fashion to the norm, therefore causing problems amongst those unfamiliar with the design. They returned to the Southern Railway in May 1943.|$|R
5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E

40|$|Believable virtual humans need {{to combine}} a {{realistic}} ap-pearance with a virtual brain that {{is able to}} approximate human cognition and behavior. To pursuit this goal, the IViHumans platform is composed of two separate layers, one for graphical processing {{and one for the}} artificial intel-ligence computation. This paper describes some relevant aspects of the experience of developing the IViHumans platform, with a greater focus on the graphical processing layer. We concentrate our description in virtual humans and their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and <b>to</b> express emotion...|$|R
50|$|Also in August 1948, the {{leadership}} of Czechoslovakia ordered that the Israeli Air Force supply base at Žatec be shut down. This base, codenamed Etzion, was used in Operation Balak, the shipment of arms to Israel. This freed up a number of IAF transport aircraft {{that could be used}} in Israel, although no place existed to hold them. For this purpose, the Ekron Airfield was refitted and expanded, officially opening on August 17. The IAF's Transport Squadron then held an exercise which tested its <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> large quantities of goods.|$|R
5|$|Stephen's {{personal}} qualities {{as a military}} leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> military forces quickly over relatively long distances. In response to the revolts and invasions, Stephen rapidly undertook several military campaigns, focusing primarily on England rather than Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, {{with the task of}} retaking the key port of Dover, under Robert's control. A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the battle of the Standard in August by the forces of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of Gloucestershire, first striking north into the Welsh Marches, taking Hereford and Shrewsbury, before heading south to Bath. The town of Bristol itself proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area. The rebels appear to have expected Robert to intervene with support that year, but he remained in Normandy throughout, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself. Dover finally surrendered to the queen's forces later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: {{one that can}} move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable {{at the beginning of}} the game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E
50|$|Acanthostega {{is seen as}} part of {{widespread}} evolutionary radiation in the late Devonian period, starting with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs, with their successors showing increased air-breathing capability and related adaptions to the jaws and gills, as well as more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and use of the fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are displayed by the earlier Tiktaalik, which like Ichthyostega showed signs of greater <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around on land, but is thought to have been primarily aquatic.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} puzzles {{philosophy}} is dealing with is how meaning comes about. An increasing number of investigations in cognitive science indicate that the body plays {{a central role in}} grounding the meaning of concepts and language. Particularly there are many indications that our <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> perceive and act upon the world are directly related to our capacity to understand linguistic expressions. In this paper we will review some of the more salient findings in this area of research and indicate their consequences for the debate about how meaning and body are related...|$|R
5000|$|Coral Castle is an oolite {{limestone}} structure {{created by}} the Latvian American eccentric Edward Leedskalnin (1887-1951) located in Leisure City, Florida, in Miami-Dade County {{at the intersection of}} South Dixie Highway (U.S. 1) and SW 157th Avenue. The structure comprises numerous megalithic stones (mostly limestone formed from coral), each weighing several tons. [...] It is currently a privately operated tourist attraction. Coral Castle is noted for legends surrounding its creation that claim it was built single-handedly by Leedskalnin using reverse magnetism or supernatural <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and carve numerous stones weighing many tons.|$|R
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October the 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps {{attacked}} {{the east end}} of Polecappelle as XIV Corps to the north attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division attacked northwards into Houthulst Forest. (The 35th Division was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank.) The attack was intended to push forward the left flank of the Fifth Army, to guard against a German counter-attack on the flank of the Canadian Corps, when it attacked Passchendaele. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French captured all their objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division infantry reached the fringes of Houthulst Forest but were pushed back in places after being outflanked in turn. German counter-attacks after 22 October, had an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November 1917).|$|E
5|$|The {{first game}} to feature fist {{fighting}} was Sega's boxing game Heavyweight Champ (1976), which is viewed from a side-view perspective like later fighting games. However, it was Data East's fighting game Karate Champ (1984) which popularized martial arts themed games. The same year, Irem's Hong Kong cinema-inspired Kung-Fu Master (known as Spartan X in Japan) laid {{the foundations for}} side-scrolling beat 'em ups with its simple gameplay and multiple enemies. Also in 1984, Bruce Lee combined multi-player, multi-character combat with traditional collecting, platform and puzzle gameplay. Later that year, Karateka combined the one-on-one fight sequences of Karate Champ with the freedom of movement in Kung-Fu Master, and it successfully experimented with adding plot to its fighting action. It was also among the first beat 'em ups to be successfully ported to home systems. Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun, released in 1986 in Japan, deviated from the martial arts themes of earlier games and introduced street brawling to the genre. The Western adaptation Renegade (released the same year) added an underworld revenge plot that proved more popular with gamers than the principled combat sport of other games. Renegade {{set the standard for}} future beat 'em up games as it introduced the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> both horizontally and vertically. It also introduced the use of combo attacks; in contrast to earlier games, the opponents in Renegade and Double Dragon could take much more punishment, requiring a succession of punches, with the first hit temporarily immobilizing the enemy, making him unable to defend himself against successive punches.|$|E
