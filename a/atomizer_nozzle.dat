Atomizer nozzles can create atomization from a variety of mechanical means, which includes but is not limited to electrostatics processes, ultrasonic nozzle and centrifugal forces.|$|E

50|$|In home or {{restaurant}} cooking, a ball {{of wheat}} flour dough is kneaded under water until the starch disperses out. In industrial production, a slurry of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass. This mass is collected by centrifugation, then transported through several stages integrated in a continuous process. About 65% {{of the water in}} the wet gluten is removed by means of a screw press; the remainder is sprayed through an <b>atomizer</b> <b>nozzle</b> into a drying chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature a short time to evaporate the water without denaturing the gluten. The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is air cooled and pneumatically transported to a receiving vessel. In the final step, the processed gluten is sifted and milled to produce a uniform product.|$|E
30|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are already being}} used in the mass production of structural components in the automotive industry, particularly at the BMW Group. Adhesive bonding is generally considered to be the best technique for joining CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic) light-weight structures. The conventional NDT (nondestructive testing) methods currently being used focus on the detection of material defects, e.g. debonding. These methods give little information about the surface properties or bond quality. A new ENDT (extended nondestructive testing) method is the BonNDTinspect system, based on a patent held by the Fraunhofer IFAM. An ultrasonic <b>atomizer</b> <b>nozzle</b> creates a water-aerosol and the small water droplets are sprayed onto the surface. Depending on the surface properties (surface energy or contamination state), the aerosol will form wide or narrow drops on the surface. We determined a test for certain contaminations, including release agents, oil, and fingerprints, the detection of which is critical to ensure the performance of adhesively joined CFRP structures. The BonNDTinspect system is an inline-capable NDT technique that is suitable for distinguishing surface states for adhesive bonding of CFRP. We verify this statement with destructive tests, including the single-lap shear test. It was found by using an extension of the evaluation criteria {{that it is possible to}} detect contamination such as water-soluble release agent, CFRP dust and fingerprints. The investigated contamination with hydraulic oil allows only a clear differentiation between cleaned and contaminated. A contamination with corundum is not detectable by the BonNDTinspect system alone.|$|E

The most common of these are rotary disk and single-fluid high pressure swirl <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Atomizer</b> wheels are known to provide broader particle size distribution, but both methods allow for consistent distribution of particle size. Alternatively, for some applications two-fluid or ultrasonic nozzles are used. Depending on the process needs, drop sizes from 10 to 500 µm can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The most common applications are in the 100 to 200 µm diameter range. The dry powder is often free-flowing.|$|R

40|$|This Final Report {{is issued}} in two volumes, {{covering}} {{research into the}} combustion of Coal Water Fuels (CWF). Two separate but related tasks are discussed; Volume I contains results obtained under Task 1 - Fundamental aspects of Coal-Water Fuel Droplet Combustion in which the experiments were carried out in Laminar Flow Reactors. The present report, Volume II, covers experiments under Task 2 - "Secondary Atomization of Coal-Water Mixtures". Three methods of improving spray fineness by fuel treatment were investigated - 1) the heating of the CWF under pressure to produce steam as the pressure drops during passage of the CWF through the <b>atomizer</b> <b>nozzle</b> 2) the absorption of CO 02 gas in the CWF to produce a similar effect, and 3) {{the addition of a}} chemical additive which will cause microexplosions in the droplets upon heating. These treatments are expected to produce disruptive atomization, i. e., the disintegration of slurry droplets subsequent to their leaving the atomizing nozzle, and therefore to yield better burnout and finer fly ash particle size distribution upon combustion. The effects of disruptive atomization upon CWF spray size distribution were studied using a spray test chamber equipped with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer; the data were fitted to the Rosin-Rammler particle size distribution function. The combustion characteristics of the treated CWFs were investigated in the MIT Combustion Research Facility. The spray chamber tests established that thermally-assisted atomization produced reductions both in the mean droplet size and in the mass fraction of large particles in the spray. For fuel delivery temperatures up to 100 *C this effect is attributable to lowered fuel viscosity, while further heat of the CWF (to 1500 C in these experiments) produces disruptive atomization. In-flame measurements and high speed cine pictures made during combustion tests provided detailed information for comparisons of treated and untreated CWF. Thermally-assisted atomization was the most effective of the methods studied for improving carbon conversion efficiency and reducing fly ash particle size. CO 02 and picric acid addition techniques showed substantial improvements but they were less effective.

40|$|Nitric oxides (NOx) {{are formed}} as a {{byproduct}} of combustion and contribute to ground-level ozone formation {{and the creation of}} conditions harmful for human health. In response to air pollutant emissions regulations, technologies for controlling NOx formation for a entire spectrum of fuels ranging from gaseous, liquid, coals, biomass and residue-derived fuel are of great importance. The technology of Moderate or Intense-Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion (also known as HiTAC or FLOX®) holds the potential to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution emissions for liquid fuels. It relies on the dilution of recirculated combustion products in pre-heated air, yielding low temperature gradients within combustion chamber and NOx emissions. This study concerns an experimental investigation of spray flames generated in a laboratory-scale burner designed for the combustion of liquid fuels in MILD conditions. The objective was twofold: 1) reach fundamental understanding of the process and, 2) create a database useful for validation of computational models. The successful validation of these models will aid the design and optimization of industrial combustion systems. The configuration used in this study consists of a spray jet injected into a coaxial upward flow of either air or hot-diluted combustion products. The latter case resembles an environment with temperature and oxygen dilution typical for advanced MILD combustors. An important characteristic of the developed system is that the properties of the fluid entrained in the near burner zone are controlled independently of the progress of combustion in the spray flame or the flue gas composition downstream of the flame. By contrast, in a typical furnace or boiler configuration, the properties of the entrained flow are determined by in-furnace aerodynamics and cannot be varied independently. The greater flexibility of this 'spray-in-hot-coflow' burner compared to a furnace or a boiler configuration, makes possible to study systematically a range of different conditions. The spray was created using a commercial pressure-swirl atomizer. Ethanol and acetone were used as fuel because of their well-known physical properties and the availability of detailed and reduced chemical mechanisms for the combustion process. Flames with several combinations of spray and coflow conditions were studied in detail, namely 1) ethanol reacting sprays in air and hot-diluted coflow, 2) ethanol reacting sprays in different hot-diluted coflow conditions, and 3) acetone and ethanol sprays in an identical hot-diluted coflow. High-speed visualizations of liquid breakup were performed to provide insight on the atomization mechanisms. Complementary laserbased diagnostic techniques, PDA and CARS were employed to characterise the properties of gas and liquid phase in the spray region. PDA provided simultaneous measurements of droplet velocity and size statistics and CARS the gas-phase temperature statistics. For the first time, CARS has been applied to determine gas-phase temperature statistics in regions with high droplet density. The velocity and temperature statistics of the coflow were measured using respectively LDA and CARS. The composition of the coflow was measured using a flue gas analyzer. The coflow measurements together with the measurements in the spray region {{as close as possible to}} the atomizer, provides a dataset of inflow boundary conditions useful for numerical simulations. First, a comparative study of an ethanol spray in air and an ethanol spray in hot-diluted coflow was performed. These two test-cases serve as basis for comparison between conventional and MILD combustion of liquid fuels. The high-speed visualizations show that a liquid sheet cone emerges from the <b>atomizer</b> <b>nozzle</b> and disturbances, initiating from the nozzle tip, grow in space causing a local thinning of the liquid sheet and disruption. In the case of hot coflow, the presence of strong vaporization promotes the thinning of the liquid sheet and the onset of disruption takes place earlier. Although, in air and hot diluted coflow differences are observed on the onset of disruption, a similar droplet size distribution in the near atomizer region is observed for both cases and the resulting differences in the spray flame structure farther downstream stem from the different properties of the entrained coflow, i. e. temperature and oxygen dilution. In the case of air coflow, an inner and an outer flame-front is observed. In the case of hotdiluted coflow, the heat-release in the inner flamefront is substantially smaller. A significant reduction of temperature samples above 2000 K is observed in the outer flame-front for the hot-diluted case. Secondly, three ethanol sprays issuing in coflows with different temperature and oxygen dilutions were studied. The Weber number remains identical among the three cases and the temperature and the oxygen dilution were varied together. The results provide insights in the gas flow and the droplet distribution in the near atomizer field as well as the subsequent droplet dispersion. Complementary to this set of measurements, a parametric study was made concerning the sensitivity of ethanol spray flames with the injection pressure (and, therefore, initial liquid jet velocity) as well as the coflow conditions. A linear relationship was found between the lift-off height and the injection pressure which is different from what has been observed in a similar burner for a gaseous fuel jet in hot coflow. The lift-off height was found to depend on the droplet convective, vaporization and chemical time scales prior to ignition. The spray flame structure does not change with the different coflow conditions. At the outer flame-front, the peak temperatures above 2000 K are found to correlate with the coflow conditions. Higher coflow temperatures (and, therefore, higher droplet vaporization rates) together with the lower oxygen dilution lead to an increase of the peak temperatures. Thirdly, a comparative study was made of the structure of an ethanol and an acetone spray flame in identical coflow conditions. This study provides insight on the atomization mechanics, the stabilization processes and the resulting peak temperatures of liquid fuels with different physical properties burning in MILD conditions. Both flames are lifted but their visual characteristics are very different. The acetone case is found to have a higher lift-off height contrary to what would be expected based on comparison of the physical properties of the liquid fuels. High-speed visualizations show that for acetone cavitation occurs inside the atomizer. As consequence, the initial droplet distribution, turbulent dispersion of droplets and turbulence modulation of the gas-phase by droplets changes drastically and this is also at the basis of the larger lift-off height of the acetone flame. The two flames also drastically differ in the nature of the spray in the outer region. In the ethanol flame the outer region is predominantly filled by large droplets. In the acetone flame small droplets with low inertia are present and quickly follow the mixing structures contributing to vaporization and the formation of an ignitable mixture. The present study provides fundamental scientific knowledge and insight on the nature of MILD combustion for liquid fuels. In general it can be concluded that differences in properties of the recirculated hot combustion products yield different atomization characteristics and, subsequently, different turbulent dispersion and turbulence modulation of the gas-phase flow due to the presence of droplets. Although combustion in hot-diluted coflow conditions in general leads to absence of high peak temperatures, the degree in which peak temperatures are avoided depends on the interaction between coflow conditions and the characteristics of the atomization process. Additionally, the dataset offers new opportunities for model validation. Its value comes from the combination of several features such as: challenging complexity, degree of completeness of the dataset for each single case and availability of several cases with different flame structure and liquid fuels.

40|$|The flame quality {{indicator}} concept was developed at BNL specifically {{to monitor the}} brightness of the flame in a small oil burner and to provide a ''call for service'' notification when the brightness has changed from its setpoint, either high or low. In prior development work BNL has explored the response of this system to operational upsets such as excess air changes, fouled <b>atomizer</b> <b>nozzles,</b> poor fuel quality, etc. Insight Technologies, Inc. and Honeywell, Inc. have licensed this technology from the U. S. Department of Energy and have been cooperating to develop product offerings which meet industry needs with an optimal combination of function and price. Honeywell has recently completed the development of the Flame Quality Monitor (FQM or Honeywell QS 7100 F). This is a small module which connects via a serial cable to the burners primary operating control. Primary advantages of this approach are simplicity, cost, and ease of installation. Call-for-service conditions are output in the form of front panel indicator lights and contact closure which can trigger a range of external communication options. Under this project a field test was conducted of the FQM in cooperation with service organizations in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. At total of 83 field sites were included. At each site the FQM was installed in parallel with another embodiment of this concept [...] the Insight AFQI. The AFQI incorporates a modem and provides the ability to provide detailed information on the trends in the flame quality {{over the course of the}} two year test period. The test site population was comprised of 79. 5 % boilers, 13. 7 % warm air furnaces, and 6. 8 % water heaters. Nearly all were of residential size [...] with firing rates ranging from 0. 6 gallons of oil per hour to 1. 25. During the course of the test program the monitoring equipment successfully identified problems including: plugged fuel lines, fouled nozzles, collapsed combustion chambers, and poor fuel pump cut-off. Service organizations can use these early indications to reduce problems and service costs. There were also some ''call-for-service'' indications for which problems were not identified. The test program also showed that monitoring of the flame can provide information on burner run times and this can be used to estimate current oversize factors and to determine actual fuel usage, enabling more efficient fuel delivery procedures...|$|R
40|$|Spray drying is an {{essential}} unit operation for the manufacture of many products with specific powder properties. It is characterized by atomization of a solution or suspension into droplets, followed by subsequent drying of these droplets by evaporation of water or other solvents. Spray drying {{is used for the}} manufacture of many consumer and industrial products such as instant food products, laundry detergents, and pharmaceuticals. It is well suited to continuous production of dry solids in powder, granulate or agglomerate particle form from liquid feed-stocks. Spray drying starts with the atomization of a liquid feedstock into a spray of droplets. Next, the droplets are put in contact with hot air in a drying chamber. The sprays are produced by either rotary (wheel) or <b>nozzle</b> <b>atomizers</b> of different types. Evaporation of moisture from the droplets and formation of dry particles proceed under controlled temperature and airflow conditions. Powder is continuously discharged from the drying chamber and recovered from the exhaust gases using a cyclone or a bag filter. The whole process generally takes {{no more than a few}} seconds. Correct atomization and air distribution are the keys to the spray drying process, as both greatly influence the final powder structure and quality. Often, spray dryers are equipped with high-speed centrifugal atomizers ensuring sturdy and reliable operation. High-Pressure nozzle atomization is used especially for products where a rather coarse powder with narrow particle distribution and high bulk density is required. In the <b>nozzle</b> <b>atomizer,</b> fines are returned around one or more central nozzles in order to facilitate optimum agglomeration. Two-Fluid nozzle agglomeration is typically applied in small chambers allowing maximum flexibility in particle design and particle engineering for both super-fine and agglomerated particles...|$|R

It involved an instrumented pilot scale roller press (corrugated surface) to set the operating parameters and control the agglomeration process assessing {{the quality of the}} product established on a lot of final granules. As result, the effect of the addition of 5 % (w/w) of binder by a spray <b>nozzle</b> <b>atomizer</b> on the caustic magnesia and the intensive mixing in a high shear mixer reduces notably the proportion of fines (by 30 %) and increases significantly the rate of granules greater than 2. mm formed when the "moist powders" are compacted in the subsequent pressure agglomeration unit.

A good understanding on the dynamic behavior of the process is important to ensure proper control. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop empirical models for spray drying of whole milk powder and orange juice powder using a <b>nozzle</b> <b>atomizer</b> spray dryer. Maltodextrin was used as the drying agent material in spray drying of orange juice powder as it is considered as sticky powder. A preliminary study on the effect of several inputs such as inlet air temperature, feed flow rate and maltodextrin concentration on the product quality was studied. The selection of suitable inputs is important to ensure the desired quality of final products (moisture content). It was found that inlet air temperature gave more significant effect on outlet air temperature and powder moisture compared to other two inputs. Inlet air temperature and outlet temperature were selected as the manipulated variable and controlled variables respectively. Empirical models were developed by applying step change in the inlet air temperature.

40|$|The first aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of atomizer design on the properties of solid lipid microparticles produced by spray congealing. Two different air atomizers have been employed: a conventional air pressure nozzle (APN) and a recently developed <b>atomizer</b> (wide pneumatic <b>nozzle,</b> WPN). Milled theophylline and Compritol® 888 ATO were used to produce microparticles at drug-to-carrier ratios of 10 : 90, 20 : 80, and 30 : 70 using the two atomizers. The {{results showed that the}} application of different nozzles had significant impacts on the morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and drug release behavior of the microparticles.

40|$|The {{effect of}} shear rate and oxygen injury during {{atomization}} {{and the combination}} of these factors on the survival of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris in spray drying was studied using laboratory and pilot scale spray dryers. The atomization was carried out using a two-fluid nozzle in the laboratory study and a two-fluid <b>nozzle</b> or rotary <b>atomizer</b> in the pilot scale study. The extent of oxygen-induced death was determined using ascorbic acid in the feed and atomizing the feed with gaseous nitrogen. The lowest levels of bacterial death were observed at lowest characteristic shear rate and in the presence of nitrogen and ascorbic acid. Quantitative analysis showed that lower shear rate, creating an oxygen-limiting environment during atomization and drying, and using oxygen scavengers in the feed were successful in enhancing bacterial survival in spray drying. We also report for the first time that, at least for L lactis, the extent of death during the atomization stage far outweighs death during the drying stage, and that the majority of bacterial death (up to 93 %) occurs during the atomization stage. The death of bacteria was found to be less when using a rotary atomizer or when using a two-fluid <b>nozzle</b> <b>atomizer</b> at lower flow rate.

40|$|A novel gas {{atomization}} reaction synthesis (GARS) {{method was}} utilized to produce precursor Ni-Cr-Y-Ti powder with a surface oxide and an internal rare earth (RE) -containing intermetallic. Although Al {{is necessary for}} industrial superalloy production, the Ni-Cr base alloy system was selected as a simplified system more amenable to characterization. This was done {{in an effort to}} better study the effects of processing parameters. Consolidation and heat-treatment were performed to promote the exchange of oxygen from the surface oxide to the RE intermetallic to form nanometric oxide dispersoids. Alloy selection was aided by an internal oxidation and serial grinding experiment that found that Hf-containing alloys may form more stable dispersoids than Ti-containing alloys, but the Hf-containing system exhibited five different oxide phases and two different intermetallics compared to the two oxide phases and one intermetallic in the Ti-containing alloys. Since the simpler Ti-containing system was easier to characterize, and make observations on the effects of processing parameters, the Ti-containing system was used for experimental atomization trials. An internal oxidation model was used to predict the heat treatment times necessary for dispersoid formation as a function of powder size and temperature. A new high-pressure gas atomization (HPGA) nozzle was developed with the aim of promoting fine powder production at scales {{similar to that of the}} high gas-flow and melt-flow of industrial <b>atomizers.</b> The atomization <b>nozzle</b> was characterized using schlieren imaging and aspiration pressure testing to determine the optimum melt delivery tip geometry and atomization pressure to promote enhanced secondary atomization mechanisms. Six atomization trials were performed to investigate the effects of gas atomization pressure and reactive-gas concentration on the particle size distribution (PSD). Also, the effect on the rapidly solidified microstructure (as a function of powder size) was investigated as a function of reactive-gas composition and bulk alloy composition. The results indicate that the pulsation mechanism and optimum PSDs reported in the literature were not observed. Also, it was determined that reactive gas may marginally improve the PSD, but further experiments are required. The oxygen content in the gas was also not found to be detrimental to the microstructure (i. e., did not catalyze nucleation), but may have removed potent catalytic nucleation sites, although not enough to significantly alter the microstructure. Overall, the downstream injection of oxygen was not found to significantly affect either the PSD or undercooling (as inferred from microstructure and XRD observations), but injection further upstream, including in the gas atomization nozzle, remains to be investigated...|$|R
