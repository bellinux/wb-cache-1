He deserted from the Greek military because of his democratic convictions and founded the organization National Resistance. He went into self-exile in Cyprus in order to develop a plan of action. He returned to Greece where, {{with the help of his}} collaborators, he organized the 13 August 1968 assassination attempt against Papadopoulos, close to Varkiza. The attempt failed and Panagoulis was arrested.%> In an interview held after his liberation, Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci quoted Panagoulis as saying: I didn’t want to kill a man. I’m not capable of killing <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to kill a tyrant.|$|E

[...] The Young Avengers earned Marvel its first (and to date only) GLAAD Award Best Comic Book Award in 2005. Hulkling was originally planned to be a female character: According to Tom Brevoort, [...] "Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>I</b> suspect this {{was as close as}} Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic.

500|$|When Charlie {{first arrived}} in the Bay, Channel Seven {{described}} her as having a [...] "bone to pick and the prowess to do it" [...] in reference to her father, Ross' (David Downer) relationship with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances), which Charlie disapproved of because her mother had only recently died. They also described her as having a [...] "warm heart" [...] and being [...] "family oriented". Charlie can be [...] "misunderstood" [...] at times, which makes her appear brash. On her character, Anderson said, [...] "Charlie is strong-willed with lots of guts and she is never afraid to show who she is, which makes her genuine and likeable". Whilst interviewed by the Llanelli Star, Anderson described Charlie's responsibilities stating: [...] "Charlie is very passionate about her work. She cares about Ruby more than life itself and is responsible for her, so these are priorities over a finding <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>I</b> don't think it's a matter of need for her but she definitely would like someone to share her life with and that romantic element is a good balance in Charlie's somewhat serious life." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1938, deHavilland {{began dating}} {{business}} tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, {{who had just}} completed his record-setting flight {{around the world in}} 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, [...] "He was a rather shy man ... and yet, in a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn't do anything heroic in life, here was this man who was a real hero." [...] In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor's agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, but she felt that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life. [...] "John was a very great love of mine", she would later admit, [...] "He was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>I</b> wanted to marry." ...|$|E

500|$|In his prime, Smith {{was widely}} {{recognised}} by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator. Hempstone considered him [...] "a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise {{with what he}} regards as wrong", while Welensky compared dealing with him to [...] "trying to nail jelly to a wall". He had an [...] "iron nerve", to quote his RF colleague PK van der Byl, and a reputation for [...] "icy calm"; he almost never got angry or raised his voice. He spoke with [...] "a nasal monologue" [...] as Peter Younghusband described it—"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards". His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an [...] "ordinary, decent fellow", which Berlyn cites as {{a major factor in}} his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an [...] "almost hypnotic influence" [...] over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win [...] "election after election... hands down". He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by People magazine in 1976, asserted that [...] "If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago." [...] Sithole, the long-time ZANU leader, said: [...] "Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way we fought.

[...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>I</b> put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E
