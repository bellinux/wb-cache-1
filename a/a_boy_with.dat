Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers.

25|$|Autism Speaks {{believes}} that vaccines {{have been shown}} to be safe for most children, and are important for preventing serious diseases such as measles and mumps.

This has strained relations between the Wrights and their daughter Katie, the mother of <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> autism. Katie believes her son's autism was caused by thiomersal, a preservative that was formerly common in children's vaccines in the United States; no major scientific studies have confirmed this hypothesis.|$|E
