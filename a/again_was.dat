5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern <b>again</b> <b>was</b> harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, bunkers, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 gunnery {{training}} exercises, Patrie suffered mechanical {{problems with}} her sighting equipment that disabled {{one of her}} main battery turrets.

Her hull was damaged, and {{she was forced to}} put into Toulon for repairs.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, when Bauer <b>again</b> <b>was</b> {{asked to}} {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Berry {{recorded}} his only 1,000-yard season, as he caught 74 passes and had career highs in receiving yards (1,298) and receiving {{yards per game}} (108.2). Each of those totals led the NFL that year by a wide margin; no other player had more than 1,000 yards, and the next highest yards-per-game average was 81.0. He had a mid-season string of six straight games with over 100 yards, during which he caught 50 passes for 920 yards and eight touchdowns. Berry <b>again</b> <b>was</b> a Pro Bowl invitee, and earned first-team All-Pro honors from all the same selectors as the previous year, including unanimous All-Pro recognition by UPI sportswriters.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, {{and reached}} the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals and the semi-finals of Copa Mercosur, but had a bad season in the {{national}} league, the Copa João Havelange. The following year, despite a good performance in the Brasileirão with a squad that included Marques, Guilherme and Gilberto Silva, the team <b>again</b> <b>was</b> eliminated in the competition's semi-finals, eventually finishing in fourth place. Atlético then finished in {{the upper part of}} the national league table in the following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, he was {{released}} on bail by court order. A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing {{to show up for}} a hearing on a murder case in Islamabad. He was placed under house arrest in Karachi. A day later, he {{was released}} on $5,000 bail. His release, rearrest, and then release <b>again</b> <b>was</b> regarded as a sign of growing reconciliation between Musharraf's government and the PPP. After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow <b>again</b> <b>was</b> approximately US$500,000.|$|E

5|$|Mölders joined an {{infantry}} regiment of the Reichswehr in Allenstein, East Prussia on 1 April 1931. After {{completing his}} basic military training in October 1932, {{he transferred to}} the Military School Dresden. On 1 June 1933, he successfully completed his training in Dresden and was promoted to ensign. He <b>again</b> <b>was</b> transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the Pioneer School in Munich. During his training years, Mölders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit for flying. He tried again and was given conditional permission (bedingt tauglich—with constraints) to begin flight training.|$|E
5|$|Never Say Never <b>Again</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by Warner Bros. in October 1983, opening to positive reviews {{and was a}} commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although less overall than the Eon-produced Octopussy released in the same year. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to date, owns the distribution rights and also distributes Eon's Bond films, and the company has handled subsequent home video releases of the film.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September, {{however, the}} Indonesians {{proposed}} a way out: an alternative route through the Lombok Strait. The British took {{them up on}} this offer, to the relief of both parties, and the Victorious made a peaceful return through Indonesian territory. War was averted, and the climax of tensions during the Confrontation had been passed. Never <b>again</b> <b>was</b> the threat of all-out war a realistic possibility, despite some large land battles in northern Borneo the following spring, and the Confrontation wound down by late fall of 1965. It had never escalated into a major conflict, and a peace deal was signed the following year.|$|E

5|$|Stiller {{joined his}} parents in the family film Heavyweights (1995), in which he played two roles, and had an uncredited {{supporting}} role in Adam Sandler's Happy Gilmore (1996). Next, he had lead roles in If Lucy Fell and Flirting with Disaster, before tackling his next directorial effort with The Cable Guy, which starred Jim Carrey. Stiller once <b>again</b> <b>was</b> featured in his own film, as twins. The film received mixed reviews, but was noted for paying the highest salary for an actor up to that point, as Carrey received $20million {{for his work in}} the film. The film also connected Stiller with future Frat Pack members Jack Black and Owen Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Brigade's advance {{continued}} {{for the next}} two days until, when the brigade had reached the final ridge before Salamaua, the 29th Brigade arrived to take over. The 2/7th Infantry Battalion, however, still detached to the 15th Brigade, continued on with them and as a result remained in the thick of it until the end when Salamaua fell on 20 September. Meanwhile, the rest of the 17th Brigade was on its way back to Australia and by mid-September, it arrived on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland where it was once <b>again</b> <b>was</b> placed under the 6th Division's command.

He gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane, in the presence of Anne, began opening and shutting it.

5|$|The monsoon trough {{spawned a}} {{tropical}} disturbance over the western Pacific Ocean {{to the east}} of Guam around October7. The system moved steadily westward, organizing enough for the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on October9. After the disturbance passed south of Guam, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 18W late on October9, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit the next day. While passing north of Yap in the Caroline Islands, the depression intensified into a tropical storm according to the JTWC, which gave it the name Zeb. The JMA <b>again</b> <b>was</b> delayed in upgrading by a day.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this <b>again</b> <b>was</b> moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
