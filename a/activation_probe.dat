However, pleiotropic and crosstalk signaling of GPCRs makes functional selectivity difficult to decode. To look from the initial active receptor point of view, we developed new, highly sensitive and direct bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based G protein <b>activation</b> <b>probes</b> specific for all G protein isoforms, and we used them to evaluate the G protein-coupling activity of [(1) Sar(4) Ile(8) Ile]-angiotensin II (SII), previously described as an angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor-biased agonist that is G protein independent but β-arrestin selective. By multiplexing assays sensing sequential signaling events, from receptor conformations to downstream signaling, we decoded SII as an agonist stabilizing a G protein-dependent AT(1 A) receptor signaling module {{different from that of}} the physiological agonist angiotensin II, both in recombinant and primary cells. Thus, a biased agonist does not necessarily select effects from the physiological agonist but may instead stabilize and create a new distinct active pharmacological receptor entity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{publication}} was to present and evaluate the methods for reference dosimetry in the epithermal neutron beam at the neutron capture therapy facility at Studsvik. Measurements were performed in a PMMA phantom and in air using ionization chambers and <b>activation</b> <b>probes</b> in order to calibrate the epithermal neutron beam. Appropriate beam-dependant calibration factors were determined using Monte Carlo methods for the detectors {{used in the present}} publication. Using the presented methodology, the photon, neutron and total absorbed dose to PMMA was determined with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 5. 0 %, +/- 25 %, and +/- 5. 5 % (2 SD), respectively. The uncertainty of the determination of the photon absorbed dose was comparable to the case in conventional radiotherapy, while the uncertainty of the neutron absorbed dose is much higher using the present methods. The thermal neutron group fluence, i. e., the neutron fluence in the energy interval 0 - 0. 414 eV, was determined with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 2. 8 % (2 SD), which is acceptable for dosimetry in epithermal neutron beams...|$|R
40|$|Peptide probes for imaging retinal {{ganglion}} cell (RGC) apoptosis {{consist of}} a cell-penetrating peptide targeting moiety and a fluorophore-quencher pair flanking an effector caspase consensus sequence. Using ex vivo fluorescence imaging, we previously validated the capacity of these probes to identify apoptotic RGCs in cell culture and in an in vivo rat model of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) -induced neurotoxicity. Herein, using TcapQ 488, a new probe designed and synthesized for compatibility with clinically-relevant imaging instruments, and real time imaging of a live rat RGC degeneration model, we fully characterized time- and dose-dependent <b>probe</b> <b>activation,</b> signal-to-noise ratios, and probe safety profiles in vivo. Adult rats received intravitreal injections of four NMDA concentrations followed by varying TcapQ 488 doses.

40|$|Providing a {{detection}} method for diagnostic of charged fusion products in tokamaks presents a major challenge, while its absolute calibration with a sufficient accuracy and its capability to withstand harsh fusion reactor environment will be required.

40|$|Activation {{studies were}} {{performed}} in JET with new in-vessel activation monitors. Though primarily dedicated to R&D in the challenging issue of lost alpha diagnostics for ITER, {{which is being}} addressed at JET with several techniques, these monitors provide for both neutron and charged particle fluences. A set of samples with different orientation {{with respect to the}} magnetic field is transported inside the torus by means of a manipulator arm (in contrast with the conventional JET activation system with pneumatic transport system). In this case, radionuclides with longer half-life were selected and ultralow background gamma-ray measurements were needed. The irradiation was closer to the plasma and this potentially reduces the neutron scattering problem. This approach could also be of interest for ITER, where the calibration methods have yet to be developed.

40|$|In ITER, {{magnetic}} fusion will explore the burning plasma regime. Because such burning plasma is sustained {{by its own}} fusion reactions, alpha particles need to be confined (Hazeltine 2010 Fusion Eng. Des. 7 – 9 85). New experiments using d(3 He,p) α and d(d,p) t fusion reaction products were performed in JET. Fusion product loss was measured from MHD-quiescent plasmas with a charged particle <b>activation</b> <b>probe</b> installed at a position opposite to the magnetic field ion gradient drift (see figure 1) — 1. 77 m above mid-plane—in the ceiling of JET tokamak. This new kind of escaping ion detector (Bonheure et al 2008 Fusion Sci. Technol. 53 806) provides for absolutely calibrated measurements. Both the mechanism and {{the magnitude of the}} loss are dealt with by this research. Careful analysis shows measured loss is in quantitative agreement with predictions from the classical orbit loss model. However, the comparison with simulated loss radial profile, although improved compared with previous studies in TFTR, Princeton, US (Zweben et al 2000 Nucl.

40|$|AbstractHere we {{describe}} a novel method for imaging apoptosis in cells using a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probe selective for caspase- 1 (interleukin β-converting enzyme, ICE). This biocompatible, optically quenched ICE-NIRF probe incorporates a peptide substrate, {{which can be}} selectively cleaved by caspase- 1, resulting in the release of fluorescence signal. The specificity of this probe for caspase- 1 is supported by various lines of evidence: 1) activation by purified caspase- 1, but not another caspase in vitro; 2) <b>activation</b> of the <b>probe</b> by infection of cells with a herpes simplex virus amplicon vector (HGC-ICE-IacZ) expressing a catalytically active caspase- 1 -IacZ fusion protein; 3) inhibition of HGC-ICE-IacZ vector-induced <b>activation</b> of the <b>probe</b> by coincubation with the caspase- 1 inhibitor YVAD-cmk, but not with a caspase- 3 inhibitor; and 4) <b>activation</b> of the <b>probe</b> following standard methods of inducing apoptosis with staurosporine, ganciclovir, or ionizing radiation in culture. These results indicate that this novel ICE-NIRF probe {{can be used in}} monitoring endogenous and vector-expressed caspase- 1 activity in cells.

40|$|Objective. Molecular {{processes}} underlying Barrett's malignant {{development are}} poorly understood. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are enzymes involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and malignant development. Therefore, active MMPs {{may have a}} role in early metaplasia development and Barrett's esophagus' malignant progression. We desired to gain more insight into the role of MMPs during the Barrett's esophagus pathogenesis sequence. Material and methods. In a surgical Barrett's mouse model, and in nonmalignant Barrett's and malignant esophageal cell lines, the activity of MMPs was investigated using a MMP activatable probe. MMP activity was further validated in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma patient biopsies and was further differentiated by investigating MMP 9 and MMP 13 expressions. Results. The mouse model showed <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> in stromal cells early on in the esophagitis and metaplasia stages. MMP <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> was higher in the Barrett's and cancer cell lines and biopsies as compared to normal cells and tissues. Co-immunostainings confirmed that, at the tissue level, the <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> was mostly confined to CD 45 -positive stromal cells. MMP 13 expression was highest in Barrett's metaplasia, whereas MMP 9 was highest in the esophageal adenocarcinomas. Conclusion. During the Barrett's pathogenesis process, MMP activity is increased early on in the inflamed esophagus and remains high in metaplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, there is a switch of MMP 13 to MMP 9 expression once neoplasia develops. In the future, detecting specific MMP subtypes could be used for distinguishing nonmalignant from neoplastic Barrett's esophagu...|$|R

40|$|The <b>activation</b> <b>probe</b> is {{a robust}} tool to measure flux of fusion {{products}} from a magnetically confined plasma. A carefully chosen solid sample {{is exposed to}} the flux, and the impinging ions transmute the material making it radioactive. Ultra-low level gamma-ray spectroscopy is used post mortem to measure the activity and, thus, the number of fusion products. This contribution presents the numerical analysis of the first measurement in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, which {{was also the first}} experiment to measure a single discharge. The ASCOT suite of codes was used to perform adjoint/reverse Monte Carlo calculations of the fusion products. The analysis facilitates, for the first time, a comparison of numerical and experimental values for absolutely calibrated flux. The results agree to within a factor of about two, which can be considered a quite good result considering the fact that all features of the plasma cannot be accounted in the simulations. Also an alternative to the present probe orientation was studied. The results suggest that a better optimized orientation could measure the flux from a significantly larger part of the plasma.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{sought to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that in patients with borderline personality disorder, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and associated regions would not be activated during a task requiring motor inhibition in the setting of negative emotion. Such a finding would provide a plausible neural basis for the difficulty borderline patients have in modulating their behavior during negative emotional states and a potential marker for treatment interventions. METHOD: A specifically designed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) <b>activation</b> <b>probe</b> was used, with statistical parametric mapping analyses, to test hypotheses concerning decreased prefrontal inhibitory function in the context of negative emotion in patients with borderline personality disorder (N= 3 D 16) and healthy comparison subjects (N= 3 D 14). 3 -T fMRI scanning was used to study brain activity while participants performed an emotional linguistic go/no-go task. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed that under conditions associated with the interaction of behavioral inhibition and negative emotion, borderline patients showed relatively decreased ventromedial prefrontal activity (including medial orbitofrontal and subgenual anterior cingulate) compared with healthy subjects. In borderline patients, under conditions of behavioral inhibition in the context of negative emotion, decreasing ventromedial prefrontal and increasing extended amygdalar-ventral striatal activity correlated highly with measures of decreased constraint and increased negative emotion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest specific frontolimbic neural substrates associated with core clinical features of emotional and behavioral dyscontrol in borderline personality disorder...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOlfactory {{receptor}}s (ORs) form a {{large family}} of G protein-coupled receptor proteins (GPCRs) responsible for sensing the ambient chemical environment. The molecular recognition strategies used by ORs to detect and distinguish odorant molecules are unclear. Here, we investigated the variable of odorant carbon chain conformation for an established odorant-OR pair: n-octanal and rat OR-I 7. A series of conformationally restricted octanal mimics were tested on live olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Our results support a model in which unactivated OR-I 7 binds aliphatic aldehydes indiscriminately, and then applies conformational and length filters to distinguish agonists from antagonists. Specific conformers are proposed to activate OR-I 7 by steric buttressing of an OR <b>activation</b> pocket. <b>Probing</b> endogenously expressed rat OSNs with octanal and constrained mimics furnished evidence that odorant conformation contributes to an odorant's unique olfactory code signature...|$|R

40|$|We have cloned and {{expressed}} microplasminogen (mPlg), {{consisting of the}} N-terminal undecapeptide of human glu-Plg spliced to its proenzyme domain. This truncated (approximately 28 kDa) proenzyme retained the distinctive catalytic activities of the larger parent. Replacement of M residues followed by M shuffling permitted subsequent scission by site-directed chemical proteolysis (in CNBr/formic acid) without impairing any of the protein's characteristic properties. Activation of chymotrypsinogen-related zymogens occurs by limited proteolysis; the newly liberated, highly conserved N-terminus (VVGG) forms a salt bridge with an aspartyl residue immediately upstream of the active site serine.

40|$|The {{ability of}} systemically {{administered}} bacteria to target and replicate to high numbers within solid tumours is well established. Tumour localising bacteria can be exploited as biological vehicles for {{the delivery of}} nucleic acid, protein or therapeutic payloads to tumour sites and present researchers with a highly targeted and safe vehicle for tumour imaging and cancer therapy. This work aimed to utilise bacteria to activate imaging probes or prodrugs specifically within target tissue {{in order to facilitate}} the development of novel imaging and therapeutic strategies. The vast majority of existing bacterial-mediated cancer therapy strategies rely on the use of bacteria that have been genetically modified (GM) to express genes of interest. While these approaches {{have been shown to be}} effective in a preclinical setting, GM presents extra regulatory hurdles in a clinical context. Also, many strains of bacteria are not genetically tractably and hence cannot currently be engineered to express genes of interest. For this reason, the development of imaging and therapeutic systems that utilise unengineered bacteria for the <b>activation</b> of <b>probes</b> or drugs represents a significant improvement on the current gold standard. Endogenously expressed bacterial enzymes that are not found in mammalian cells can be used for the targeted <b>activation</b> of imaging <b>probes</b> or prodrugs whose activation is only achieved in the presence of these enzymes. Exploitation of the intrinsic enzymatic activity of bacteria allows the use of a wider range of bacteria and presents a more clinically relevant system than those that are currently in use. The nitroreductase (NTR) enzymes, found only in bacteria, represent one such option. Chapter 2 introduces the novel concept of utilising native bacterial NTRs for the targeted activation of the fluorophore CytoCy 5 S. Bacterial-mediated <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> allowed for non-invasive fluorescence imaging of in vivo bacteria in models of infection and cancer. Chapter 3 extends the concept of using native bacterial enzymes to activate a novel luminescent, NTR activated probe. The use of luminescence based imaging improved the sensitivity of the system and provides researchers with a more accessible modality for preclinical imaging. It also represents an improvement over existing caged luciferin probe systems described to date. Chapter 4 focuses on the employment of endogenous bacterial enzymes for use in a therapeutic setting. Native bacterial enzymatic activity (including NTR enzymes) was shown to be capable of activating multiple prodrugs, in isolation and in combination, and eliciting therapeutic responses in murine models of cancer. Overall, the data presented in this thesis advance the fields of bacterial therapy and imaging and introduce novel strategies for disease diagnosis and treatment. These preclinical studies demonstrate potential for clinical translation in multiple fields of research and medicine...|$|R

40|$|Most {{patients}} with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) experience drug-resistant disease recurrence. Identification of new treatments {{is a high}} priority, and preclinical studies in mouse models of EOC may expedite this goal. We previously developed methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tumor detection and quantification in a transgenic mouse model of EOC. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether three-dimensional (3 D) fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) and fluorescent molecular imaging probes could be effectively used for in vivo detection of ovarian tumors and response to therapy. Ovarian tumor-bearing TgMISIIR-TAg mice injected with fluorescent probes were subjected to MRI and FMT. Tumor-specific probe retention was identified in vivo by alignment of the 3 D data sets, confirmed by ex vivo fluorescent imaging and correlated with histopathologic findings. Mice were treated with standard chemotherapy, and changes in fluorescent probe binding were detected by MRI and FMT. Ovarian tumors were detected using probes specific for cathepsin proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and integrin αvβ 3. Cathepsin and integrin αvβ 3 <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> and retention correlated strongly with tumor volume. MMP <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> was readily detected in tumors but correlated less strongly with tumor volume.

We show that alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences adopting Z-conformation exhibit DNAse I foot printing even in a protein free system. The logical deductions from the results indicate that 1) altered structure like Z-DNA is not a favourable substrate for DNase I, 2) both the ends of the alternating purine-pyrimidine insert showed hypersensitivity, 3) B-form with a minor groove of 12 - 13 A is a more favourable substrate for DNase I than an altered structure, 4) any structure of DNA deviating largely from B form with a capacity to flip over to the B-form are potential targets for the DNase I enzymic probes in naked DNA...|$|R

40|$|T-cell {{activation}} is the net {{product of}} competing {{positive and negative}} signals transduced by regulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) binding to corresponding ligands on T cells. Having previously identified DC-HIL as a receptor expressed by APCs that contains an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) –like domain, we postulated that it {{plays a role in}} T-cell <b>activation.</b> To <b>probe</b> this function, we created soluble recombinant DC-HIL, which we observed to bind activated (but not resting) T cells, indicating that expression of the putative ligand on T cells is induced by activation. Binding of DC-HIL to naive T cells attenuated these cells' primary response to anti-CD 3 antibody, curtailing IL- 2 production, and preventing entry into the cell cycle. DC-HIL also inhibited reactivation of T cells previously activated by APCs (secondary response). By contrast, addition of soluble DC-HIL to either allogeneic or ovalbumin-specific lymphocyte reactions augmented T-cell proliferation, and its injection into mice during the elicitation (but not sensitization) phase of contact hypersensitivity exacerbated ear-swelling responses. Mutant analyses showed the inhibitory function of DC-HIL to reside in its extracellular Ig-like domain. We conclude that endogenous DC-HIL is a negative regulator of T lymphocyte activation, and that this native inhibitory function can be blocked by exogenous DC-HIL, leading to enhanced immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To develop enzyme activatable Förster {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET) substrate probes to detect MMP- 12 and MMP- 13 activities in vivo in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis Methods. Peptidic FRET probes activated by MMP- 12 and MMP- 13 were reverse designed from inhibitors {{selected from a}} peptide phosphinic inhibitor library. Selectivity of the probes was demonstrated in vitro using MMP- 1, MMP- 2, MMP- 3, MMP- 12, and MMP- 13. In vivo <b>activation</b> of the <b>probe</b> was tested in the zymosan-induced mouse model of inflammation and probe specificity was evaluated by the metalloprotease inhibitor GM 6001 and specific synthetic inhibitors of MMP- 12 and MMP- 13. The probes were used to follow these enzyme activities in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in vivo. Results. The MMP- 12 - and MMP- 13 -activity probes (MMP 12 ap and MMP 13 ap, respectively) discriminated between the two enzymatic activities. The in vivo <b>activation</b> of these <b>probes</b> was inhibited by GM 6001 and by their respective specific inhibitors. In the CIA model, MMP 12 ap activation peaked 5 days after disease onset and showed strong correlation with disease severity during this time (r = 0. 85; p < 0. 0001). MMP 13 ap activation increased gradually after disease onset and correlated with disease severity {{over a longer period}} of 15 days (r = 0. 58; p < 0. 0001). Conclusion. We have generated two selective FRET probes that can be used to follow MMP- 12 and MMP- 13 activities in live animals. MMP 12 ap follows the initial stage of inflammation in CIA, while MMP 13 ap follows the progression of the disease. The specificity of these probes is useful in monitoring the efficacy of MMP inhibitors. © 2013 American College of Rheumatology...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} in neuroscience research The integration of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) with cognitive and affective neuroscience paradigms enables examination of the brain systems underlying the behavioral deficits manifested in schizophrenia; there have been a remarkable {{increase in the number of}} studies that apply fMRI in neurobiological studies of this disease. This article summarizes features of fMRI methodology and highlights its application in neurobehavioral studies in schizophrenia. Such work has helped elucidate potential neural substrates of deficits in cognition and affect by providing measures of <b>activation</b> to neurobehavioral <b>probes</b> and connectivity among brain regions. Studies have demonstrated abnormalities at early stages of sensory processing that may influence downstream abnormalities in more complex evaluative processing. The methodology can help bridge integration with neuropharmacologic and genomic investigations...|$|R
40|$|Several {{investigators}} {{have shown the}} utility of systemically delivered optical imaging probes to image tumors in small animal models of cancer. Here we demonstrate an innovative method for imaging tumors and tumor margins during surgery. Specifically, we show that optical imaging probes topically applied to tumors and surrounding normal tissue rapidly differentiate between tissues. In contrast to systemic delivery of optical imaging probes which label tumors uniformly over time, topical probe application results in rapid and robust <b>probe</b> <b>activation</b> that is detectable as early as 5 minutes following application. Importantly, labeling is primarily associated with peri-tumor spaces. This methodology provides a means for rapid visualization of tumor and potentially infiltrating tumor cells and has potential applications for directed surgical excision of tumor tissues. Furthermore, this technology could find use in surgical resections for any tumors havin...|$|R
