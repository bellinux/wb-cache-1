5|$|A {{variant of}} the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> System, Automatic and Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The system {{currently}} uses <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> Signaling with fixed wayside {{signals and}} automatic train stops {{in order to}} provide safe train operation across the whole system. The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its 1904 opening, and many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Today little {{mechanical}} signalling remains, with local signal boxes controlling signals abolished from many areas {{as part of}} the Regional Fast Rail project. The suburban network and busier regional lines use variants of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> Signalling, while quieter lines use the Train Staff and Ticket or Train Order systems of safeworking. Train protection has also progressed, with the Train Protection & Warning System also introduced on major passenger lines {{as part of the}} Regional Fast Rail project.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNow days, averting {{collision}} of trains is a chief issue in railway sector. The prime cause for {{this problem is}} improper signaling for trains due to faulty working of sensors or result of decision making systems responsible for signaling. There are many systems incorporated for railway signaling such as Absolute <b>Block</b> System, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Blocking</b> system, Following Train system, and one train only system and pilot guard system. Generally <b>Automatic</b> <b>Blocking</b> system is preferred in railway sectors. Nonetheless, the system is still completely efficient for avoiding {{collision of}} trains. The proposed system comes with the solution for this problem to avoid chance of collision...|$|R
5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E
25|$|In the New York {{metropolitan}} area, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{operates the}} New York City Subway, which is mostly manually operated. The subway system currently uses <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> Signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops. Many {{portions of the}} signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s. Because {{of the age of}} the subway system, some replacement parts must be custom built for the MTA, as they are otherwise unavailable from signaling suppliers. Additionally, some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and cannot operate extra trains with the current <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> Signaling system.|$|E
25|$|The line is {{double track}} throughout, and {{controlled}} by <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signalling. Intermediate terminating facilities are provided only at Darling, {{although it is not}} normally used.

50|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} with 25 kV 50 Hz alternating current on 27 August 1984 (freight lines and branch lines continuing to use diesel), and the restrained permissivity <b>automatic</b> <b>blocking</b> system was {{installed on the}} line, offering increasingly less satisfactory service {{with respect to the}} growing mixed passenger-goods traffic on the line since the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of an <b>automatic</b> <b>blocking</b> system the 20 minute {{interval}} between passenger trains was enforced by operators at open stations. Unfortunately between Grand Forks and Surrey, a distance of 200 miles, only four stations were open when the Empire Builder passed. When the two sections left the last open station 31 minutes apart, the two previous stops had taken 25 minutes, nullifying the 20-minute spacing interval.|$|R
25|$|Most {{lines in}} Melbourne operate under an <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits signals to operate {{automatically}} {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.|$|E
25|$|In October 1914, {{a second}} track began {{operation}} between Jamaica and Linden Boulevard. In 1916, New York City {{took over the}} rights to Rockaway Boulevard/Rockaway Turnpike, paving and grading the road. The western half of the road was widened, while the eastern half on which the trolley line resided retained its original width. In 1917, the line would receive <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signaling and iron trolley poles to replace the original wooden ones.|$|E
25|$|After {{the turn}} of the century the Northern Pacific had a record of steady improvement. Together with the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific also gained control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, gaining {{important}} access to Chicago, the central Middle West and Texas, as well as the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, an important route through eastern and southern Washington. Its physical plant was upgraded continuously, with double-tracking in key areas, and <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signaling along its entire main line. This in turn gave way to centralized traffic control, microwave and radio communications as time progressed.|$|E
50|$|The railway from Amiens to Rouen is a French 114-kilometre long railway line, {{that connects}} Amiens to Rouen. It was opened in 1867. The line was {{electrified}} on 27 August 1984 at 25 kW 50 Hz, and {{was equipped with}} the restrained permissivity <b>automatic</b> <b>blocking</b> system, which since the 1990s has offered increasingly unsatisfactory operating conditions {{with respect to the}} increasing mixed passenger and goods traffic on the line.|$|R

50|$|All the {{features}} {{from the previous}} title remain, including all player-usable units, with the exception that G-Crossover has been removed. A new system Next Dash, which can cancel moves instantly was introduced. <b>Automatic</b> <b>blocking</b> {{has been replaced by}} manual blocking. The music theme for Z Gundam, Gundam Wing, Gundam SEED, Gundam SEED Destiny, and Gundam 0083 are changed. Music theme for Gundam 00 has been added, and an additional theme has been added for Mobile Suit Gundam.|$|R
25|$|The {{railways}} mostly use {{colour signal}} lights. Earlier the older semaphores and discs-based signalling (depending on the position or colour) were used, {{but these were}} replaced by colour signals. Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> systems. However, the signals at stations are almost invariably interlocked with the setting of points (routes) and so safety {{does not depend on}} the skill of the station masters. With the planned introduction of Cab signalling/Anti collision devices the element of risk on account of drivers overshooting signals will also be eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Traffic on {{the lines}} reached its peak during this period. The {{introduction}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signals allowed an increase in train frequency to every 6 minutes. Construction of a third track on the Gdynia – Rumia segment also continued. Thanks to the change to 3000V, the electric multiple units were able to operate beyond the Gdańsk – Wejherowo line, and run on the same tracks as standard trains in case of emergency. As a result, regular trains could also run on SKM tracks. In 1975, the annual number of passengers travelling by SKM exceeded 100 million people. Ridership sometimes reached 300 thousand passengers daily.|$|E
25|$|The CBTC {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 1994 {{and approved by}} the MTA in 1997. Installation of the signal system was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signal system. The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. In the 2015–2019 Capital Program, funding was provided for three more electrical substations for the line so that it could accommodate even more trains per hour. Also included in the Capital Program is the installation of automatic signals on the line to facilitate the movement of work trains between interlockings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. RECSY is {{a library}} for solving {{triangular}} Sylvester-type matrix equations. Its objectives are both speed and reliability. In {{order to achieve}} these goals, RECSY is based on novel recursive blocked algorithms, which call high-performance kernels for solving small-sized leaf problems of the recursion tree. In contrast to explicit standard blocking techniques, our recursive approach leads to an <b>automatic</b> variable <b>blocking</b> {{that has the potential}} of matching the memory hierarchies of today’s HPC systems. The RECSY library comprises a set of Fortran 90 routines, which uses recursion and OpenMP for shared memory parallelism to solve eight different matrix equations, including continuous-time as well as discrete-time standard and generalized Sylvester and Lyapunov equations. Uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance results of our recursive blocked algorithms and corresponding routines in state-of-theart libraries LAPACK and SLICOT are presented. The performance improvements of our recursive algorithms are remarkable, including 10 -fold speedups compared to standard algorithms.

25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signal system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} occurred {{south of}} Valemount, [...] east {{of a small}} station named Canoe River, [...] westbound from Cedarside.

The leading cars of each train were derailed, while those which {{had been part of the}} troop train were demolished. According to testimony at the inquiry, most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train's ruptured boiler penetrating the damaged cars. At the moment of the crash, two soldiers, Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe, both of Newfoundland, were buying cigarettes at the newsstand aboard the train. The structure of the newsstand shielded them in the crash, and they survived. Their fellow Newfoundlanders, Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White, standing just a few feet away, were not shielded by the newsstand and perished.|$|E

2500|$|The {{system is}} old, and some {{replacement}} parts must be custom {{built for the}} MTA, as {{they are no longer}} available from signaling suppliers. The old signals break down more easily, since some signals have outlasted their 50-year service life by up to 30 years, and signal problems accounted for 13% of all subway delays in 2016. Additionally, some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and cannot operate extra trains with the current <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> Signaling system. Changes in assumptions about train performance, and changes in operational rules also had notable impact on system throughput, such as the prohibition of movement of trains past permissive signals at restricted speed (No Key-By without permission from Control Center.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The LIRR {{also took}} other steps {{to improve its}} {{physical}} image and its operations. In the 1950s they started a new publicity campaign, adopting a new [...] "Dashing Dan" [...] and [...] "Dashing Dottie" [...] logo and painted its trains in a gray color scheme.The railroad also continued to perform major capital improvement projects. During the 1950s and 1960s the Montauk Branch between Jamaica and Babylon continued going through a massive grade crossing elimination project, with the line being elevated from street level {{over a number of}} years. Mandated by federal and state agencies after the 1950 Kew Gardens (Richmond Hill) train collision, the railroad began to install an Automatic Speed Control system to supplement (and later replace) the wayside <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signal system on a majority of its lines. Finally, the LIRR was able to completely replace its steam locomotives with diesels, with the last steam-hauled trains running on October 8, 1955.

50|$|In the 1960s, the {{signalling}} {{systems were}} rebuilt {{along the entire}} route. <b>Automatic</b> <b>block</b> signaling was established between Salzburg and Freilassing in 1963. In addition, push button relay interlockings were installed in Prien and Bad Endorf stations in 1963. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system was installed between the two stations on 28 June 1964 for 233,000 Deutsche Marks, making the signalbox at Rimstings station unnecessary. On 14 July 1969 and in the following days, the automated route setting interlocking in Traunstein, the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Übersee and Traunstein and the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Traunstein and Teisendorf opened. So for 2.092 million Deutsche Marks the personnel at Bergen (Oberbay) and Lauter (Oberbay) were able to be saved. On 11 December 1978, a centralised block was established between Teisendorf and Freilassing, which was controlled by an automated route setting interlocking of the SpDrS60 design. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system went into operation between Prien am Chiemsee and Übersee on 1 July 1980. Bergen (Oberbay) station was closed to passenger traffic at the same time. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system was taken into operation between Landl (Oberbay) {{and the start of}} the Rosenheim curve on 21 January 1982. The <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Landl and Bad Endorf was not opened until 26 November 1985. The entire upgrade between Rosenheim and Bad Endorf cost 4.7 million Deutsche Marks.
