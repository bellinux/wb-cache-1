5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become irritable or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing so, she has to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>love,</b> she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of her energy to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing to touch him for the first time.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with New York magazine, he elaborated:Sexuality, and sexual orientation – regardless of orientation – is just natural. An act of sex {{is one of the}} most human things. But an organization like the church, say, through its doctrine, would undermine humanity by successfully teaching shame about sexual orientation – that it is sinful, or that it offends God.

25|$|In a {{book written}} by Yehuda Berg, {{a former teacher}} at the center, he {{recommended}} that men not masturbate as semen generated without loving, shared intention does not serve its purpose. He also wrote that a man should not orgasm before the woman, as it injects selfishness into the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> making. Other thoughts on sex include that a man should not orgasm with the woman positioned above him, as she is then drawing energies into herself from below, instead of above. The most Light is derived from sex that occurs just after midnight on Saturday morning.|$|E

25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E
25|$|After leaving Hogwarts, Snape {{became a}} Death Eater and {{informed}} Voldemort of half of an overheard prophecy, which Voldemort takes {{to refer to}} Lily and her son, Harry. Fearing for Lily's life, Snape joins the Order as a spy for Dumbledore, in exchange for what he hopes will be Dumbledore's protection of Lily. Voldemort offered Lily the chance to step aside before he killed Harry because of Snape's request to spare Lily's life, but Lily refused and Voldemort killed her. The result of her selfless <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> manifested itself two ways: when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the Killing Curse the spell backfired, rendering Voldemort non-corporeal. The lingering protection afforded to Harry by Lily's sacrifice rendered Voldemort unable to touch him physically. The second way in which Harry is protected by Lily's sacrifice occurs when Petunia takes Harry in. Dumbledore told Harry that he had extended Lily's protection to Privet Drive, because Lily and Petunia are related by blood. This protection ends when Harry comes of age at 17.|$|E

25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

[...] "Partition" [...] has a fractured production and is lyrically about the female protagonist having sex with her romantic interest in the backseat of a limousine. Caitlin White, writing for The 405, highlighted that the song details a romantic relationship in which women do not act as sexual objects during sexual intercourse but rather use [...] "the physical <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> as a form of agency", from which they derive pleasure. [...] "Partition" [...] gained significant attention for its explicit lyrics, with frequent references made to the opening lines of the first verse in which Beyoncé asks her driver to put up the partition.|$|E

500|$|Shatner {{conceived}} {{his idea}} for the film's story before he was officially given the director's job. His inspiration was televangelists; [...] "They [...] were repulsive, strangely horrifying, and yet I became absolutely fascinated," [...] he recalled. Shatner was intrigued {{that not only did}} these personalities convince others God was speaking directly to them, but they became wealthy by what Shatner considered false messages. The televangelists formed the basis for the character Zar, later Sybok. Shatner's first outline was titled An <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> and many of its elements— the Yosemite vacation, the abduction of Klingon, human and Romulan hostages on the failed paradise planet— survived to the final film. In Shatner's early draft, Kirk is overwhelmed by Zar's superior numbers of followers and Spock, McCoy {{and the rest of the}} Enterprise crew come to believe in Zar's divinity. Kirk feigns acceptance of Zar's beliefs to travel with him to the God planet, which to Shatner would be a desolate, fiery waste. When Kirk confronts [...] "God", the image of the being transforms into that of Satan, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy split up in their escape. Kirk eludes capture but goes back to save his friends from being carried away to Hell.|$|E
500|$|... "Caravan" [...] and [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] {{were cited}} by Harrington as {{examples}} of Morrison's interest in [...] "the mystifying powers of the music itself" [...] throughout Moondance. The former song thematizes music radio and gypsy life—which fascinated the singer—as symbols of harmony. Harrington called it an ode to [...] "the transcendent powers of rock 'n' roll and the spontaneous pleasures of listening to a great radio station", while biographer Erik Hage regarded it as [...] "a joyful celebration of communal spirit, the music of radio, and romantic love". [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] reconciles Moondances R style with the more orchestrated folk music of Astral Weeks, along with what Evans described as [...] "the complimentary sides of Morrison's psyche". Harrington believed it explores [...] "the intricate balance between life's natural wonder and the cosmic harmony of the universe". Hinton said the song evoked a sense of [...] "visionary stillness" [...] shared with [...] "And It Stoned Me" [...] and the gypsy imagery of [...] "Caravan", while working on several other interpretive levels. Its images of setting sail and water in particular represented [...] "a means of magical transformation" [...] for the writer, comparable to Alfred Lord Tennyson's poems of leave-taking such as [...] "Crossing the Bar", which had [...] "the same sense of crossing over, both to another land and into death". The lyrics also deal with [...] "the mystical union of good sex", and an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> Hinton said was intimated by Morrison's closing vocal [...] "too late to stop now"—a phrase the singer would use to conclude his concerts in subsequent years.|$|E
