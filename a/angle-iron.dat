2500|$|The steel gridshells of the {{exhibition}} pavilions of the 1896 All-Russian Industrial and Handicrafts Exposition in Nizhny Novgorod were the first publicly prominent examples of Shukhov's new system. Two pavilions of this type were built for the Nizhni Novgorod exposition, one oval in plan and one circular. The roofs of these pavilions were doubly curved gridshells formed entirely of a lattice of straight <b>angle-iron</b> and flat iron bars. Shukhov himself called them azhurnaia bashnia ("lace tower", i.e., lattice tower). The patent of this system, for which Shukhov applied in 1895, was awarded in 1899.|$|E
2500|$|Shukhov {{also turned}} his {{attention}} to the development of an efficient and easily constructed structural system (gridshell) for a tower carrying a large gravity load at the top – the problem of the water tower. His solution was inspired by observing the action of a woven basket holding up a heavy weight. Again, it took the form of a doubly curved surface constructed of a light network of straight iron bars and <b>angle-iron.</b> [...] Over the next twenty years, he designed and built close to two hundred of these towers, no two exactly alike, most with heights in the range of 12m to 68m.|$|E
2500|$|A {{replacement}} boom {{was constructed}} some 15–60 m (16–65 yards) {{west of the}} Second World War boom between 1950 and 1953 by the Admiralty. [...] The boom comprised two off-set rows of concrete piles, linked by <b>angle-iron</b> straps. [...] The boom at the Essex-side had two changes of direction along its length before meeting the deep water channel. [...] There was a corresponding boom at the Sheerness (Kent) side of the estuary. [...] In times of emergency {{the gap between the}} two was intended to be closed by moored Royal Navy vessels. [...] By this time the nature of the threat was shifting from submarines to nuclear-armed bombers against which the boom would have served little defence. [...] With the coming of nuclear-armed rockets, jet-powered bombers and the hydrogen bomb in the mid-1950s the boom became obsolete. [...] It is the only known anti-submarine boom constructed during the Cold War.|$|E

Blurred figures were standing more than ankle deep in water on the slanted rows of puncheons, and Jefferson, who could not see them very well, blinked again when an Englishman, stripped to the waist, moved towards him.

Perhaps he had not even seen it. Presently, lolling at ease, he said, [...] "Dash it all! I tell you it bulged. I was holding up my lamp along the <b>angle-iron</b> in the lower deck when a flake of rust as big as the palm of my hand fell off the plate, all of itself." [...] He passed his hand over his forehead. [...] "The thing stirred and jumped off like something alive while I was looking at it." [...] "That made you feel pretty bad," [...] I observed casually.

60|$|Once again, setting {{her teeth}} {{because of the}} agony that the touch of the marble gave to her raw and swollen flesh, Miriam began to fret the cords which bound her wrists against the rough edge of the <b>angle-iron.</b> She was {{sure that it was}} nearly worn through, but oh! how could she endure the agony until it parted? Still she did endure, for at her feet lay the bottle, and burning thirst drove her to the deed. Suddenly her reward came, and she felt that her arms were free; yes, numbed, swollen and bleeding, they fell against her sides, {{wrenching}} the stiffened muscles of her shoulders back to their place in such a fashion that she well-nigh fainted with the pain. Still they were free, and presently she was able to lift them, {{and with the help of}} her teeth to loose the ends of the cord, so that the blood could run once more through her blackened wrists and hands. Again she waited till some feeling had come back into her fingers, which were numb and like to mortify. Then she knelt down, and drawing the leather bottle to her, held it between her palms, while, with her teeth, she undid its thong. The task was hard, for it was well tied, but at length the knots gave, and Miriam drank. So fearful was her thirst that she could have emptied the bottle at a draught, but this she, who had lived in the desert, was too wise to do, for she knew that it might kill her. Also when that was gone there was no more. So she drank half of it in slow sips, then tied the string as well as she was able and set it down again.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of drive-through systems {{is that the}} vehicle {{does not have to}} stop for cleaning. As the vehicle passes the magnetic-sensor or photo-sensor at the entrance, the washing process is triggered. During the slow passage (5 mph speed) through the wash platform, the vehicle's tires, wheel wells and mud flaps are cleaned by water sprayed from many strategically placed nozzles (spray bar). The nozzles are mounted <b>angle-iron</b> grids which open the tire treads and flushing the mud for a high cleaning performance. The washing platform is usually of galvanized steel. The first modern systems were introduced as the MobyDick “Quick” series at a German construction industry trade exhibition. The Quick system was a significant design improvement from the modified high pressure truck wash systems that were used as wheel and tire wash systems before. Today all modern drive through systems are based on the engineering and design development of the Quick series.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1880s, Shukhov {{began to}} work on the problem of the design of roof systems to use a minimum of materials, time and labor. His {{calculations}} were most likely derived from mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev's work on the theory of best approximations of functions. Shukhov's mathematical explorations of efficient roof structures led to his invention of a new system that was innovative both structurally and spatially. By applying his analytical skills to the doubly curved surfaces Nikolai Lobachevsky named [...] "hyperbolic", Shukhov derived a family of equations that led to new structural and constructional systems, known as hyperboloids of revolution and hyperbolic paraboloids. The steel gridshells of the exhibition pavilions of the 1896 All-Russian Industrial and Handicrafts Exposition in Nizhny Novgorod were the first publicly prominent examples of Shukhov's new system.

[...] He described his very first test-ride as [...] "absolutely terrifying" [...] and resulted in a crash and a chipped kneecap. [...] Other early problems, including a series of electrical fires, arose, and he was then joined by California robotics expert Trevor Blackwell, who had previously designed a eunicycle, a single-wheeled gyro-stabilized vehicle, as well as a two-wheeler that resembled a Segway PT, to iron out the initial problems.Blackwell and Gulak refined the Uno's gyro control system so the machine would properly balance and move smoothly. [...] Gulak then used the revised plans to develop a prototype vehicle with the help of engineer Werner Poss, Veltronics Ltd. of Brampton, Ontario, John Cosentini of Motorcycle Enhancements, a custom motorcycle builder in Oakville, Ontario, and research partner Jason Morrow.|$|E
50|$|Launched in 1821, Aaron Manby was {{the first}} {{steamship}} to be built of iron. She {{was the brainchild of}} the eccentric but far-seeing naval officer Captain (later Admiral) Charles Napier, who had conceived the idea of a fleet of steamships for service on the River Seine. The ship was named after the master of the Horseley Ironworks, Tipton, Staffordshire, where she was pre-fabricated to a design jointly formulated by Captain Napier, Aaron Manby and his son Charles. She was then shipped in pieces to Rotherhithe on the Thames and assembled there. Of 116 tons burthen, the ship was 120 feet (36.6 m) long. Her flat-bottomed hull was made of 1/4 in iron plate fastened to <b>angle-iron</b> ribs. There was one deck, of wood, and a bowsprit. The ship's distinctive profile boasted a single 47 ft funnel. The engine was of the oscillating type, designed and patented (British Patent No 4558 of 1821) by Aaron Manby. The paddlewheels: were 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter but only 2.5 feet (76 cm) wide, because the vessel's maximum beam was limited to 23 feet (7.0 m) for service on the Seine. Defying the prevailing wisdom of the day, the iron-hulled vessel not only floated but made 9 knots (10 mph, 17 km/h) and drew one foot (30 cm) less water than any other steamboat then operating.|$|E

Current population levels appear severely depressed in all subbasins except possibly the John Day, which could be classified as depressed. The most probable reasons for population declines include: dams, chemical treatment activities, declining habitat quality (e. g. high water temperatures, poor water quality, low instream flows), and <b>angle-iron</b> in fishways to prevent lamprey passage...|$|E
40|$|Belle Apocalypse is the {{culminating}} exhibition for my California State University, Chico Master of Fine Arts degree. Shown from May 16 through June 1, 2013 at 1078 Gallery in Chico, California, Belle Apocalypse is a mixed-media {{installation of}} glass, fabric and light. The installation is a literal and figurative ecclesiastical visual allegory on certain lionized aspects of 21 st Century American society: spectacular terror, resource consumption, and religious mythology. Two philosophic theories provide the intellectual foundations underpinning the work: Immanuel Kant's {{notion of the}} sublime, and Guy Debord's theory of spectacle culture. The main component of the exhibition is a large (5. 5 ' tall x 3 ' wide) threedimensional stained glass collage of ???The Tower??? from the Ryder-Waiter Tarot, a widely-used set of playing cards first published in 1909. The entire Belle Apocalypse collage and all accompanying framing elements are suspended at 14 feet from exposed <b>angle-iron</b> roof trusses and hang {{directly in front of}} the rear gallery wall. The glass used for the collage is a combination of medieval-style hand-blown furnace glass and commercial "art" sheet glass. An extravagant window treatment (drapes, also hanging from the roof truss), designed with materials selected for their reflective, light-transmitting and light-diffusing qualities surrounds the central glass figures. Two argon-gas sculptures, like neon signs, frame the stained glass installation in front of the drapes. The collage is framed at the base by two orange fabric table runners crisscrossing a round wooden fortuneteller???s dais. The entire gallery space is lit with theatrical stage lighting; the skylight and front windows are covered with simple blackout drapes to conceal ambient daylight. The ersatz- religious mood of the piece is completed with the placement of two benches arranged, like church pews, for contemplating the installation...|$|E
