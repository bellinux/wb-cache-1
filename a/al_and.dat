5|$|The American League (<b>AL)</b> <b>and</b> the National League (NL) alternated picks {{throughout}} the first round; because an NL team drafted {{first in the}} 1986 MLB Draft, an AL team had the first selection in 1987. Having finished 67–95 in 1986, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record in the <b>AL</b> <b>and</b> thus obtained the first overall selection. The second selection went to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the worst record in the NL.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStudies using Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts have {{determined}} that repression of upstream transcription by AL 1 protein enhances <b>AL</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>AL</b> 3 expression in Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV). Mutations resulting in the inability of TGMV AL 1 protein to associate with its cognate binding site, result in a decrease in both <b>AL</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>AL</b> 3 expression. Reduced expression correlates {{with an increase in}} transcription from the AL 62 start site, and decreased transcription from downstream initiation sites (<b>AL</b> 1935 <b>and</b> <b>AL</b> 1629) present within the AL 1 coding region. The results demonstrate that, in a tobacco protoplast system, repression of AL 62 transcription, regulated through binding of AL 1 protein to sequences in the origin of replication, is required prior to <b>AL</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>AL</b> 3 gene expression from the <b>AL</b> 1935 <b>and</b> <b>AL</b> 1629 viral transcripts. This provides a mechanism to regulate expression of AL 2, which is involved in suppression of host defense responses and is required for late gene expression...|$|R

Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets. The similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E

Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E

A Baltimore team had played in the NL through the 1899 season, after which the club was shut down by the league. Baltimore was one of three former NL cities where the AL placed teams in an effort to reach underserved fans. The new Orioles' first manager was John McGraw, who had held the same position for the previous Baltimore team in 1899; McGraw also held an ownership stake.|$|E
