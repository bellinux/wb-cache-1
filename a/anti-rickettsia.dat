40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> spp. antibodies in sera of domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) of extensive breeding in Cerro Largo county, considered an endemic area for spotted fever in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Three hundred blood samples were collected and <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> spp. antibodies were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in the sera obtained. The occurrence of <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> spp. antibodies detected in this study was 1. 33 % (4 / 300), with endpoint titers ranging from 64 to 256 for Rickettsia rickettsiii, R. parkeri and/or R. bellii. The results suggest these domestic chickens do not participate as a reservoir and/or amplifying host in the epidemiology of spotted fever in that endemic area. The present study consists in the first serological survey in Gallus gallus domesticus to Rickettsiae-spotted fever group in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the seropositivity of rickettsial infections (rickettsioses) and to as-sess risky behaviors for rickettsioses in North Anatolia, which have dense tick population. Materials and methods: Blood samples of 409 voluntary participants were collected in a cross-sectional seropreva-lence research in Samsun-Tekkeköy and 171 from Samsun Regional Laboratory, KTÜ Medical Faculty/Clinic of Infec-tion Diseases and Tokat State Hospital to determine regional characteristics and risk factors of rickettsial infections. The total sample size was 580 persons. A standard questionnaire was performed by a face to face interview with par-ticipants. The 0 - 4 age group children were not included. The presence of <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> IgG antibodies was tested in blood samples with Indirect Immunoflourescein Antibody (IFA) method. Results: Spotted fever group <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> IgG antibody seropositivity was detected in 68 (11. 7 %) blood samples. Contrarily, typhus group <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> IgG antibody seropositivity was not found in any participant. With bivariate analyses following variables were found to be significantly correlated with rickettsia seropositivity: education status (p= 0. 015), age (p= 0. 001), working in farm (p= 0. 008), working in garden (p= 0. 022), agricultural activities (p= 0. 001), being interested in relaxation activity (p= 0. 009), animal breeding (p= 0. 007), milking (p= 0. 001) and exposure to wild animals (p= 0. 004). With logistic regression analysis; age [Risk Odds Ratio ‘ROR’= 1. 03 (95 % GA= 1. 02 - 1. 05) ] and ex-posure to wild animals [ROR= 1. 97 (95 % GA= 1. 12 - 3. 46) ] were found to be associated with increased seropositivity. Conclusions: Our results supported the existence of rickettsial diseases in Turkey. Further seroepidemiological in-vestigations are needed to detect incidence/prevalences of rickettsioses and related risky behaviors in our country...|$|E
40|$|A case of rickettsial {{spotted fever}} in a 29 year-old woman, zoologist, {{presenting}} as annular exanthema is reported. The patient {{was referred to}} our clinic on June 1994 because of extensive centripedal erythematous macular rash, clearly annular in appearance, developed 7 days after the onset of high fever (38 - 39 Â°C), tender enlarged lympho nodes, malaise and headache. Radiological and laboratory investigations did not show visceral involvement. Skin biopsy was refused. The presence of malaise, fever, cutaneous rash, the season, the particular work of the patient, a zoologist, suggested an infectious etiology. Specific serological tests for rickettsial disease were clearly positive for both IgG and IgM <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> conorii, and nonspecific serological test (Weil-Felix reaction) measuring agglutinins to selected antigen from Proteus vulgaris strain OX-l 9 was also positive (1 : 200). After the diagnosis of rickettsial spotted fever, the patient was given oral ambramycin, 1500 mg, daily. Within a few days she was afebrile and symptomatically improved. We underline the rarity of the cutaneous clinical picture featuring as an annular exanthema. To our knowledge, it seems the first report that recognizes a new infectious etiology in the differential diagnosis of occasional annular dermatoses...|$|E
40|$|As ticks {{spend most}} of their time off-host, the {{environment}} is a major selective force of these parasites. In fact, human impact on landscapes has favored a minority of tick species which became well-known pests. However, this is an ongoing process and novel pests may arise. We herein report a surrogate life cycle of a neotropical tick species. Amblyomma ovate, and which may be related to an increased risk of human rickettsiosis. Under natural conditions, adults of this tick species feed on carnivores and exhibit non-nidicolous ambush behavior, whereas larvae and nymphs feed on small rodents and birds. In an anthropized spot within an Atlantic rainforest reserve of Brazil, an A. ovate population exhibited a nidicolous behavior with all 3 tick stages feeding on the dog. This dog's infestation was outstandingly high, and it displayed the highest <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> titers and harbored Rickettsia-infected ticks. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to develop a simple method for serodiagnosis of scrub typhus. The basis of the method is detection of <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> tsutsugamushi antibody in patient serum by reaction with antigens dot blotted on a nitrocellulose sheet (NCS). The final evaluation of the reaction is performed by observing the color intensity which develops as a result of sequential treatments of the NCS with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M antibody and with the substrate of the enzyme. After various trials, we found that the best results were obtained by using a purified antigen which adhered to an NCS at 0. 2 to 2 micrograms of protein per dot and a test serum diluted 1, 000 - to 4, 000 -fold. Under these conditions, almost all antibody-positive sera showed a distinct color at the dot on the NCS, so that a positive reaction could be distinguished by the naked eye from a negative reaction with antibody-negative sera, which developed only a faint color. A comparison of the results of screening of antibody-positive and -negative sera by this method and the immunofluorescence test showed that both methods produced similar results. From these results, it is concluded that this dot immunoassay can be useful for the serodiagnosis of scrub typhus...|$|E
40|$|Vector-borne {{diseases}} such as Lyme borreliosis and rickettsioses {{have been associated with}} ocular inflammation. Our aim was to study patients with diagnosed uveitis to evaluate serological signs of infection or exposure to these tick-borne agents. Forty-eight patients were prospectively examined with serology together with medical records and a questionnaire concerning previous exposure, diseases, and treatments. Seven patients (14. 6 %) showed seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. between acute and convalescent phase sera, which provides support for a positive Rickettsia diagnosis according to guidelines. The specificity was confirmed by Western blot. Additional 28 patients had stationary titres of which eight (16. 6 %) had 1 [*]:[*] 256 or higher titre in the first serum, and another 13 patients were seronegative. No epidemiological risk factor or marker could be identified. For Borrelia, only three patients showed moderate IgG titres. A control group of 100 blood donors, 60 patients with rheumatic disease, and 56 patients seeking medical care were tested of which 2. 0 – 7. 1 % showed low <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> titres and 3. 0 – 8. 3 % anti-Borrelia titres. The findings are indicative for an association between infection or exposure to Rickettsia spp. and uveitis with a seropositivity among patients with recurrent uveitis in concordance with the spread of rickettsial exposure in a tick-exposed population...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two hybridomas {{producing}} <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> conorii monoclonal antibodies {{were obtained}} by nine fusion experiments. The strain chosen for immunization of mice was MAVI, an R. conorii strain isolated from a Sicilian patient with Boutonneuse fever. When tested for immunoglobulin isotype by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay, 46. 6 % of supernatants from the 22 hybridomas were immunoglobulin M. The supernatants were tested in the IIF assay for binding to the MAVI strain and four spotted fever group rickettsia strains isolated from Sicilian ticks (two virulent and two nonpathogenic when inoculated intraperitoneally in male guinea pigs). Only five of the supernatants showed a positive IIF result on all tested strains, although they produced different titers to the various strains, possibly an indication that they recognized an antigen common to spotted fever group rickettsiae. Immunodominant epitopes for humans were determined by using patient sera to analyze inhibition of binding to the MAVI strain. Although {{a limited number of}} serum samples were screened, a high percentage of Boutonneuse fever patients produced antibodies recognizing the same epitopes as were recognized by the mouse monoclonal antibodies. A striking heterogeneity was found both in the expression of mouse-recognized epitopes on the five rickettsial strains and in the serum antibody responses of Boutonneuse fever patients to these epitopes...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{ehrlichiosis}} and babesiosis are {{the most}} prevalent tick-borne diseases in Brazilian dogs. Few studies have focused attention in surveying tick-borne diseases in the Brazilian Amazon region. A total of 129 blood samples were collected from dogs living in the Brazilian eastern Amazon. Seventy-two samples from dogs from rural areas of 19 municipalities and 57 samples from urban stray dogs from Santar&# 233;m municipality were collected. Serum samples were submitted to Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) with antigens ofBabesia canis vogeli, Ehrlichia canis, and six Rickettsia species. The frequency of dogs containing anti-B. canis vogeli, anti-E. canis, and <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> spp. antibodies was 42. 6 %, 16. 2 %, and 31. 7 %, respectively. Anti-B. canis vogeli antibodies were detected in 59. 6 % of the urban dogs, and in 29. 1 % of the rural dogs (P < 0. 05). For E. canis, seroprevalence was similar among urban (15. 7 %) and rural (16. 6 %) dogs. ForRickettsia spp., rural dogs presented significantly higher (P < 0. 05) prevalence (40. 3 %) than urban animals (21. 1 %). This first study on tick-borne pathogens in dogs from the Brazilian eastern Amazon indicates that dogs are exposed to several agents, such asBabesia organisms, mostly in the urban area; Spotted Fever group Rickettsia organisms, mostly in the rural area; andEhrlichia organisms, in dogs from both areas studied...|$|E
40|$|Em trabalho recente, foi encontrada a infecção de 9, 7 % da população de Amblyomma triste por Rickettsia parkeri, agente etiológico de riquetsiose humana, na várzea do Rio Paraná, no município de Paulicéia. Desta forma o presente trabalho busco a soroprevelência de anticorpos anti-R. parkeri em humanos, cavalos, cães e gambás; e a prevalência de infecção por R. parkeri em ectoparasitas e diferentes áreas do local. Os carrapatos adultos e ninfas coletados foram identificados com chaves específicas e as larvas por técnicas moleculares (PCR para gene 16 S rRNA mitocondrial, seguido de sequenciamento). Também foi feito o teste de presença de DNA de Rickettsia. Amostras de soro sanguineo de cães, cavalos e humanos foram analisadas pela técnica de reação de imunoflurescência indireta, para a pesquisa de anticorpos anti-R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. bellii, R. amblyommii, R. riphicephalii e R. felis. De 1699 carrapatos coletados, a maioria (1511) foi Amblyomma. Cajennense. Os demais pertenciam às espécies A. coelebs (6), A. triste (2), A. dubitatum (114), Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (55), Dermacentor nitens (10) e Amblyomma rotundatum (1). Somente 2 ninfas da espécie A. coelebs estavam infectadas com Rickettsia, com sequências 99 % de identidade para o gene ompA R. amblyommii. Dos soros de humanos coletados 25 foram negativos e somente um apresentou títulos ≤ 64 para R. parkeri e R. rickettsii. De 140 soros dos equinos, 24 % apresentou anticorpos <b>anti-Rickettsia,</b> com títulos variando de 64 a 1024, sendo que nove amostras tinham títulos anti-R. parkeri pelo menos quatro vezes maior que os para demais espécies de Rickettsia, indicando a R. parkeri como provável antígeno homólogo. Em 55 amostras de cães 7, 7 % apresentaram anticorpos <b>anti-Rickettsia,</b> com títulos variando de 64 a 256. Para duas amostras a R. parkeri foi o provável antígeno homólogo. Analisando os questionários epidemiológicos dos eqüinos, juntamente com os resultados sorológicos, a regressão logística indicou associação estatisticamente significante entre a presença de anticorpos <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> com as varáveis independentes (i) acesso à várzea (ii) e tempo de residência na região, os quais podem ser considerados fatores de risco para rickettsiose na região estudada. Foram capturados quatro gambás (Didelphis albiventris) e todos tinham anticorpos para R. parkeri, R. rickettsii, R. amblyommii e R. rhipicephalii, porém sem variação de pelo menos quatro vezes entre os títulos. Os gambás estavam infestados com ninfas A. cajennense e A. coelebs, todas negativas para o PCR para Rickettsia. Em vista destes resultados pode-se dizer que os animais domésticos e os gambás estiveram em contato com bactérias do gênero Rickettsia na região estudada, onde a várzea parece ser a {{principal}} foco de carrapatos infectados. In recent work, 9. 7 % of the Amblyomma triste {{of the marsh}} by the Paraná River in Paulicéia, State of São Paulo, was found infected with Rickettsia parkeri, the etiological agent of spotted fever rickettsiosis in humans. Based on this report, the present study aimed to determine soroprevelence of anti-R. parkeri antibodies in humans, horses, dogs and opossuns, and the prevalence of rickettsial infection in ectoparasites, in different areas of Paulicéia. While ticks were identified by using current morphological Keys for adults and nymphs, larva were identified to species by molecular methods (PCR targeting the mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene followed by DNA sequencing). Ticks were tested by PCR {{for the presence of}} Rickettsia DNA. Animal and human sera samples were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the presence of antibodies reactive to R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. belli, R. amblyommii, R. riphicephalii and R. felis. From 1699 collected ticks, a vast marjority (1511) was Amblyomma. cajennense. The remaining were the especies A. coelebs (6), A. triste (2), A. dubitatum (114), Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (55), Dermacentor nitens (10) and Amblyomma rotundatum (1). Only two nymphs of A. coelebs were found infected by Rickettsia, yielding DNA sequences 99 % identical to the gene ompA of R. amblyommii. 25 of human sera collected were negative, except for one for one that showed endpoint titer ≤ 64 to both R. parkeriand R. rickettsii. Among horses, 24 % sera contained anti Rickettsia antibodies, with titles ranging from 64 to 1024, nine samples showed anti-R. parkeri titles at least four times higher than the remaining Rickettsia species, indicating that these animals had been infected by R. parkeri. For 55 dogs, 7. 7 % anti Rickettsia antibodies, with endpoint titles ranging from 64 to 256. For two canine serum R. parkeri was considered the possible agent responsible for the infection. Through statistical analyses of the serological results with independent variables, the presence of seropositive horses was significantly associated with (i) grazing in the marsh (ii) and being for more than 8. 5 years in the region; these two independent variables were considered to be risk factors for rickettsiosis in the study region. A total of four opossums (Didelphis albiventris) were captured. All four had antibodies reactive to R. parkeri, R. rickettsia, R. amblyommii and R. rhipicephalii, however, with less than 4 -fold differences between endpont titers to different Rickettsia species. Opossums were found infested by nymphs of A. cajennense and A. coelebs, all negative to Rickettsia by PCR. Based in these results, it is concluded that domestic animals and opossums had been in contact with Rickettsia of the spotted fever group in the study region, where the marsh area seems to be the main focus of Rickettsia-infected tick...|$|E
40|$|Spotted fever is a {{typically}} endemic infectious disease caused by rickettsiae from the spotted fever group, of which Rickettsia rickettsii {{is the main}} etiologic agent. It presents high mortality rates in Brazil, with transmission to humans or animals through the bite of infected ticks. The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is an important reservoir for Rickettsia spp.; these bacteria can circulate in an infected animal presenting only fever as a clinical sign of the disease, as demonstrated by experimental infection. Considering the high zoonotic potential and the damage caused to human, animal, and environmental health, this study searched for <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> rickettsii antibodies in capybaras from an agricultural landscape {{in the city of}} Araras, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) technique was used to detect anti-R. rickettsii antibodies. From the 28 serum samples tested using IFA, 18 (64. 28 %) were considered reactive, with antibody titers ranging from 256 to 2048. Seven (38. 88 %) samples presented titers of 256, three (16. 67 %) with titers of 512, five (27. 78 %) with titers of 1024, and three (16. 67 %) with titers of 2048. However, {{it was not possible to}} significantly associate gender to these serologic results. These results demonstrate that at some point during their lives, the studied capybaras were exposed to the etiologic agent, but it is impossible to know when this occurred. Further studies need to be performed to clarify which serological titers ensure an infection in capybaras, based on clinical and laboratory assessment of rickettsemia, and to establish the relationship between titers and the chronicity of disease. This is necessary owing to the possibility of cross-reactions with other rickettsiae species of the same subgroup, leading to the need for molecular tests to confirm diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} a rickettsial serosurvey in 25 dogs and 35 humans in an endemic area for Brazilian spotted fever in the State of São Paulo, where the tick Amblyomma aureolatum {{is the main}} vector. Testing canine and human sera by indirect immunofluorescence against four Rickettsia antigens (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis and R. bellii) showed that 16 (64 %) of canine sera and 1 (2. 8 %) of human sera reacted {{to at least one}} of these rickettsial antigens with titers &sup 3; 64. Seven canine sera and the single reactive human serum showed titers to R. rickettsii at least four times those of any of the other three antigens. The antibody titers in these 7 animals and 1 human were attributed to stimulation by R. rickettsii infection. No positive canine or human serum was attributed to stimulation by R. parkeri, R. felis, or R. bellii. Our serological results showed that dogs are important sentinels for the presence of R. rickettsii in areas where the tick A. aureolatum is the main vector of Brazilian spotted fever. Este estudo avaliou a ocorrência de anticorpos <b>anti-Rickettsia</b> em 25 cães e 35 humanos, em uma área endêmica para a febre maculosa brasileira no Estado de São Paulo, onde o principal vetor é o carrapato Amblyomma aureolatum. Soros dos cães e humanos foram testados pela técnica de imunofluorescência indireta contra quatro antígenos de riquétsias (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis, R. bellii), mostrando que soros de 16 (64 %) cães e 1 (2, 8 %) humano reagiram com títulos &sup 3; 64 para pelo menos um dos antígenos de riquétsias.
