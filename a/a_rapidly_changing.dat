5|$|These were no easy years, again, {{as former}} Afrikaner compatriots {{found each other}} on {{two sides of the}} {{political}} fence, in <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> world. As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as president of the Senate. He did remain a member of that House until 1929, however.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> one.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the rhetoric}} {{surrounding}} lynchings frequently suggested {{they were to}} protect the virtue and safety of white women, the actions basically arose out of white attempts to maintain domination in <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> society and their fears of social change. Victims were the scapegoats for peoples' attempts to control agriculture, labor and education, {{as well as a}} reaction to economic stresses during downturns when cotton prices dropped, and larger disasters such as the boll weevil.|$|E
25|$|The early post-war {{period was}} {{particularly}} {{hard on the}} citizens of Japan who wanted to rebuild their lives in <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> environment. Comics became popular, in newspapers and magazines depicting scenes of everyday life injected with humour. A strong publishing industry emerged from the demand for comics, but outside of this industry the desire for cheap entertainment provoked the establishment of new comic outdoor storytelling, kamishibai. Five million children and adults were entertained across Japan daily during the post-war period.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the current}} UK {{coalition}} {{government and the}} previous Labour Government expressed concerns about the rising costs of {{a survey of the}} whole population conducted once every ten years. Meanwhile, the accuracy and utility of a snapshot of the whole UK population once every ten years compared to continued surveying was being questioned. <b>A</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> society, evolving user requirements and new opportunities were emerging as drivers for change. These concerns and opportunities encouraged the UK Government to investigate alternative methods of population data collection; to identify the best way to provide small area population, and socio-demographic statistics in the future by taking advantages of the more advanced technology that is becoming available, and also to make use of existing sources of demographic data already being collected by the private sector.|$|E

In a concept known as nearshoring, financial intuitions are shifting operations away from high-cost addresses like Wall Street, and have even shifted trading functions to Jacksonville. With relatively low-cost real estate, easy access to New York City, high-quality of life and 19,000 {{financial sector}} employees, Jacksonville has become an appealing option for relocating staff. Perhaps {{the best example of}} this is the growth of Deutsche Bank's presence in the city. Jacksonville is home to Deutsche Bank's second largest US operation, only New York is larger. Other institutions with a notable presence in Jacksonville include Macquarie Group, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Citizens Property Insurance, Fidelity Investments, Ally Financial and Aetna.|$|E
25|$|Expansion caused {{controversy}} about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During {{an age of}} tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted {{the rise of the}} new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.|$|E

500|$|The {{juxtaposition}} of such disparate programming inspired U2 and Achtung Baby co-producer Brian Eno to conceive an [...] "audio-visual show" [...] that would display <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> mix of live and pre-recorded video on monitors.

Eno, who was credited in the tour programme for the [...] "Video Staging Concept", explained his vision for the tour: [...] "the idea to make a stage set {{with a lot of}} different video sources was mine, to make a chaos of uncoordinated material happening together... The idea of getting away from video being a way of helping people to see the band more easily ... this is video as a way of obscuring them, losing them sometimes in just a network of material." ...|$|E

To {{the accompaniment of}} Sammy Davis, Jr.'s {{rendition}} of [...] "The Rhythm of Life" [...] from the 1969 film version of the 1966 Broadway musical Sweet Charity, a reverse-motion sequence begins. The three men retreat from the bar and into the street, other patrons disappearing as they pass. As they move down the street, a reverse time-lapse-style sequence transforms their clothes to match <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> urban scene, which progresses through modern-day London to the Edwardian period. Electric lights transform into gas lamps and buildings begin to disappear frame by frame. A short cutaway sequence shows the city regressing into the past, shrinking to a small Saxon settlement before disappearing entirely. Returning to the main sequence, the three men's clothes and hairstyles are adjusted into Bronze Age equivalents as they pass through thickening woodland. A close-up {{of one of the}} characters shows his features quickly transformed into those of a caveman. The trio are then frozen in an ice age glacier.|$|E
500|$|The concert {{began with}} a fixed {{sequence}} of six to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs, a further sign that {{they were no longer}} the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>changing</b> array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E
