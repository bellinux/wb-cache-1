5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{dress of}} a player is a {{protective}} equestrian helmet (usually of a distinctive colour, to be distinguished at the considerable distance from which onlookers <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> game), riding boots to just below the knees, white trousers (often ordinary denim jeans), and a coloured shirt bearing {{the number of the}} player's position. Optional equipment includes one or two gloves, wristbands, kneepads (mandatory in some clubs), spurs, face mask, and a whip. The only piece of equipment required by the United States Polo Association (USPA) rules is the helmet or cap with a chin strap..|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone will step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others <b>are</b> <b>watching.</b> <b>The</b> Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E

25|$|The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who {{are dressed}} as monks and are begging for alms, and their {{companion}} Grigoriy, {{who is in}} secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess returns with a bottle, he drinks and launches into a ferocious song ("So {{it was in the}} city of Kazan") of Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known way to get to the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam's suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman thinks he has found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam's description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and leaps out of the window. The men set off in pursuit.|$|E

BMO insists that it is a real, living boy, and attempts to demonstrate this to Football by brushing its teeth and using the toilet. Unbeknownst to BMO, Finn and Jake <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> activity from outside a window. The focus then shifts to Finn and Jake, who attempt to experience the ultimate high five. Eventually, Finn places himself in a catapult, and Jake stretches himself into a slingshot, and the two launch themselves across Ooo.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith used quick {{bursts of}} brass music to {{accompany}} the starship sequences. For scenes in which observers <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith used a [...] "spying theme" [...] that resembles his conspiracy theme from Capricorn One. Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until it is interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, but scored the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist, suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related. The film's climax is scored with the action theme, which is balanced with [...] "sense of wonder" [...] music similar to cues from The Motion Picture.|$|E

Realizing that Mort does not have a return pad that would be able to bring him back to the present, Stewie and Brian take one of the return pads and go back in time to save Mort. They end up in Warsaw, Poland and find Mort in a synagogue. He believes he is in Heaven as he sees dead family members there. It does not take long for them to realize that the date is September 1, 1939, the day of the Nazi invasion of Poland and when World War II started.|$|E
500|$|... "We Love You, Conrad" [...] {{includes}} several pop culture references. When Jillian and Peter are planning the wedding, Peter {{points out that}} only the last three words that musician Sting sings are understandable. At the restaurant, Jillian says that her fiancé speaks [...] "Orange", instead of Mandarin. Stewie calls Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) an [...] "elegant, beautiful Dutch woman." [...] The Genesis cave from [...] appears in the episode, and the scene is mirrored line for line. The episode depicts The Hills star Spencer Pratt as an orangutan from Planet of the Apes. When Brian, Lauren Conrad and Stewie <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>The</b> Hills, it suddenly cuts to footage from The A-Team. In an attempt to impress Lauren, Brian wears Austin Powers glasses. The episode also makes references to actress Lindsay Lohan and the cartoon character Mr. Magoo. The promotional image for this episode, featuring Brian, Lauren Conrad and Stewie with his woman's disguise, is a parody of an [...] "iconic" [...] The Hills photoshoot with Audrina Patridge, Conrad and Whitney Port. In addition, {{the title of the}} episode itself refers to Bye Bye Birdie, a 1960-Broadway musical. Lastly, the episode includes a reference of Bill Cosby having sexual relations with [...] "The Hills" [...] star Lauren Conrad.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in Meridian, Mississippi, a {{woman and}} her boyfriend <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> {{television}} when a news report describes the tornado killing Pinker as it hit the prison. The woman is visibly disturbed by the news. Elsewhere, it is revealed that Pinker is alive and has broken into a clothing store. He is confronted by the strip mall's private security guard and handcuffed. However, Pinker quickly slips out of the handcuffs and escapes, stealing the security guard's car. Later, Mulder inspects the handcuffs and finds that they too have become brittle like the wall at the prison, crumbling into dust. Meanwhile, Pinker begins to ransack the house of an old friend looking for something when the occupant returns. After a brief discussion with Pinker requesting the whereabouts of their mutual ex-girlfriend - the woman from earlier watching the television report - the man pulls a gun. However, as he tries to shoot Pinker, the bullets merely pass through him and Pinker kills him by apparently burning his face off. Mulder and Scully arrive shortly thereafter; Mulder examines the bullets embedded in the wall and finds that they, too, crumble into dust when compressed. [...] He muses that Pinker, after being struck by lightning, must have developed the ability to pass through solid objects. Scully argues that Pinker cannot possibly defy the laws of chemistry.|$|E

500|$|Star Wars is {{frequently}} referenced in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as [...] "the resident expert". In this episode, Star Wars is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> movies on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list, but they only own Star Wars and Tootsie so they keep watching those two films. It is again referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds his hand up to Tracy and says [...] "May the Force be with you".|$|E
500|$|As Homer and Bart <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>The</b> Itchy & Scratchy Show, Marge {{tells them}} that the {{telephone}} company has charged the family hundreds of dollars for making phone calls to Brazil. Homer and Marge decide to visit the company, thinking {{there has been a}} mistake. They meet with customer service representative Lindsey Naegle, who cuts off the family's phone service after Homer tells her that he refuses to pay the bill. Homer attempts to connect illegally to the phone lines, but only succeeds in getting electrocuted at least 5 times and, when he regains consciousness on the couch, is told that he was found [...] "smoldering in the bushes". When Lisa finds out the reason the family no longer has phone service, she confesses that she has actually made calls to Brazil. She has been sponsoring an orphan named Ronaldo in the country and she used to receive a letter from him once every month until recently. Lisa called Ronaldo's orphanage to find out what had happened and she was told he is missing. She shows her family a tape recorded by Ronaldo that she received after her first donation, in which Ronaldo thanks Lisa and tells her that with her money he has purchased a pair of dancing shoes for himself and the orphanage has been able to buy a door. Touched by the tape, the Simpsons decide to travel to Brazil to solve the mystery behind Ronaldo's disappearance, leaving Maggie with Patty and Selma.|$|E
500|$|Crystal Bell of MTV {{wrote that}} the ballad [...] "gives Ariel a purpose, reveals her deepest desire — to be where the people are — and shows us {{a glimpse of her}} strengths, vulnerabilities, and {{individual}} quirks", while establishing Ariel as an outsider. Writing for The Atlantic, Akash Nikolas agreed that as the film's [...] "I Want" [...] song, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] follows Disney's trend of establishing the main character as an outcast [...] "set apart from society by some innate desire" [...] as Ariel literally longs to be belong to a different world. Film critic Theresa Basile identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song that belongs to an adventurer who wants to explore new environments. Zaron Burnett III, writing for Thought Catalog, described the selection as a ballad in which [...] "a curious young woman ... who doesn’t fully understand the world she longs to be a part of, bravely dreams of how she can move into a new world, and reject the limitations of her father’s world (read: patriarchy)", identifying Ariel as [...] "a young feminist." [...] Meanwhile, the New York Daily News film critic Kathleen Carroll identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "typically plaintive solo" [...] that helps establish Ariel as a Broadway ingenue. Distinguished from earlier [...] "wish songs" [...] that discuss searching for [...] "happiness in everyday life", [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is about longing to abandon normalcy in favor of seeking happiness elsewhere. Comparing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] from Cinderella, Entertainment Weekly writer Esther Zuckerman observed that the song proves how different Ariel is from Disney princesses by whom she was preceded. While Cinderella's [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] is a passive song performed in third person, Ariel's number [...] "is brimming with agency" [...] to demonstrate the character's thirst for knowledge. Zuckerman credits Ashman's lyrics with providing Ariel with a personality, something she believes Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959) lacked, while giving Ariel a motive that is not romance-oriented. Additionally, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is delivered directly to the camera as opposed to an audience of woodland animals; Ariel appears as though she is speaking directly to young girls who <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|E

500|$|The {{month of}} March kicked off with charges {{from the media}} that McCarthy's {{campaign}} was just dragging along. Cited was his tardiness to the Senate floor, which failed to prevent a Southern filibuster against a civil rights bill drafted by fellow Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale. Despite the setback, three precincts in Minnesota elected McCarthy supported delegates to caucuses, {{to the detriment of}} Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, and President Johnson decided to abandon Massachusetts, giving 72 delegates to McCarthy. He described the news as [...] "encouraging." [...] At this point, McCarthy had spent a large amount of time campaigning in New Hampshire, hoping to improve his standing before the state's critical primary. Meanwhile, President Johnson's campaign circulated the slogan that [...] "the communists in Vietnam <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> New Hampshire primary...don't vote for fuzzy thinking and surrender." [...] McCarthy likened this statement to McCarthyism, a reference to Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. [...] Opinion polls prior to the New Hampshire primary showed that McCarthy's support stood at only 10 to 20 percent. Although he did not win the contest, he stunned spectators of the race by winning a surprising 42.2 percent of the vote to Johnson's 49.4 percent. Media outlets described the results as a [...] "moral victory" [...] for McCarthy, [...] and influenced Robert Kennedy's decision to enter the race on March 16. [...] Kennedy's announcement did not affect McCarthy's campaign. He remained committed to the [...] "young people" [...] who had supported his campaign all along, and remarked that he was [...] "better qualified to run for the presidency" [...] than Kennedy. McCarthy set his sights on Wisconsin and began to prepare for the state's April primary. He ran advertisements in newspapers throughout the state and included his platform. In it, he called for [...] "more federal aid for education," [...] collective bargaining rights for farmers, [...] "a guaranteed minimum livable income for all Americans," [...] the construction of [...] "at least one million new housing units each year, and more [...] "federal funds to stop pollution." [...] While in Wisconsin, he criticized the government of South Vietnam, saying that it would be [...] "too kind" [...] to label the entity as corrupt and a dictatorship. He then announced his intentions to enter the primaries in Indiana and Florida, and hoped to compete in California in the upcoming months. On March 31, President Johnson made the surprise announcement that he was dropping out of the race and would not seek to be renominated for the presidency.|$|E
