500|$|The use of {{high-strength}} steel caused problems {{as it was}} necessary to heat the steel to [...] before and after welding, and Kværner had problems finding an adequate process during late 1992. In January 1993, an appropriate process had been found, although experimentation with various methods continued for another six months. Kværner felt that the Public Roads <b>Administration</b> <b>should</b> bear the extra costs, demanding NOK 108 million in compensation, but the administration denied this, resulting in a lawsuit. On 26 January 1996, Nordhordland District Court supported the administration, but gave the plaintiff partial support, claiming the <b>administration</b> <b>should</b> take part of the costs through improper choice of material. The Public Roads Administration was sentenced to pay NOK 34 million to Kværner. Both sides appealed to Gulating Court of Appeal, which on 18 February 1998 refuted all of Kværner's claim regarding the steel boxes, and sentenced the administration to pay NOK 7.5 million. In addition, Kværner had to pay the administration NOK 19.5 million in penalties for overrunning the contract date. However, the court's decision was not unanimous. The plaintiff appealed to case to the Supreme Court, who unanimously confirmed the ruling of Gulating Court of Appeal. In addition, the plaintiff was sentenced to pay the defendants legal costs of NOK 910,000.|$|E

500|$|Silber and Nesmith, {{who felt}} that affirmative action would lower {{academic}} hiring standards, triggered strife among students and faculty (including then-dean of students Nancy Richardson) at the School of Theology. Their opponents believed that affirmative action helped increase equality in a system developed by white men. Richardson advocated affirmative action to Nesmith, arguing {{that it would not}} lower academic standards and the school's <b>administration</b> <b>should</b> reexamine its assumptions about race, women and minorities. Richardson was fired in 1981, with Nesmith attributing her termination to [...] "pedagogical and ideological differences" [...] with the administration. Richardson sued, claiming discrimination by Boston University.

[...] Nevertheless, the phrase [...] "Bring Us Together" [...] was thrown {{in the face of the}} Nixon administration by Democrats each time something divisive was proposed, and was used as the title of a tell-all expose by Leon Panetta after he was fired from the Nixon administration for dissenting from the White House's [...] "Southern strategy" [...] on civil rights policy.

[...] He also urged the administration to [...] "assure a divergence of outlook and policy between the Russians and Chinese," [...] which could be accomplished by improving relations with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev who had wanted to distance himself from the Communist Chinese. He wrote, [...] "We should... without deceiving ourselves about Khrushchev's political personality and without nurturing any unreal hopes, be concerned to keep him politically in the running and to encourage the survival in Moscow of the tendencies he personifies".

2500|$|Alternatively, the Neo-Chartalist view {{asserts that}} the co-op's <b>administration</b> <b>should</b> resolve the co-op's issues via [...] "fiscal" [...] policy.
