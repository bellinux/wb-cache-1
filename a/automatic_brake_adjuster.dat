In this paper considered {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems, were analyzed modern tracking tools that are used in <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems. Based on the statistical data on accidents, are set the main dangers, that the <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> system will be reduced. In order to ensure the accuracy of information conducted research for determination of optimal combination of different sensors that provide an adequate perception of road conditions. The tracking system should be equipped with a combination of sensors, which in the case of detection of an obstacle or dangers of signal is transmitted to the information processing system and decision making. Information from the monitoring system should include data for the identification of the object, its condition, the speed. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> on {{the other}} hand use the air or vacuum {{pressure}} to hold the brakes off against a reservoir carried on each vehicle, which applies the brakes if pressure/vacuum is lost in the train pipe. <b>Automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> are thus largely [...] "fail safe", though faulty closure of hose taps can lead to accidents such as the Gare de Lyon accident.|$|R

25|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> {{works by}} {{monitoring}} the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the <b>brakes</b> operate. The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R

25|$|For {{increased}} safety, each {{vehicle is}} also fitted with an <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> that is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a specific speed, {{such as a}} carriage running away or a locomotive engine failure. This system slows the train down using the same brake blocks and drums as the hand brake. The running speed at which the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|R

The coordinates and speed of the locomotive are given to determine the start time for safe braking. The train should comfortably stop at a given point and distance in three situations: if obstacle is on the railway, or if traffic light with a restrictive signal, or if driver do not react when passing a traffic light with a warning signal.

50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Braking</b> Type: The <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> type {{use either}} a single or {{combination}} of sensors (radar, lidar,and camera) {{to allow the}} vehicle {{to keep pace with}} the car it is following, slow when closing in on the vehicle in front and accelerating again to the preset speed when traffic allows. Some systems also feature forward collision warning systems, which warn the driver if a vehicle in front - given the speed of both vehicles - gets too close (within the preset headway or braking distance).|$|R

The aim of {{the current}} study was to assess {{effectiveness}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> system quantitatively using real pedestrian accident data selected from IVAC database. Based on the IVAC pedestrian accident scenarios, vehicle and pedestrian trajectories, and other information, the relative position of vehicles and pedestrians were estimated one second (0. 5 second) prior to the actual crash. According to the pedestrian fatal (AIS 3 +) risk and compared with the real pedestrian casualty risk, the benefit of the <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> system was calculated.

40|$|At normal pedal braking on split-μ {{a driver}} can {{actively}} steer or <b>adjust</b> <b>brake</b> level to control lateral drift. The same driver response and thus lateral deviation cannot be assumed when brakes are automatically {{triggered by a}} collision mitigation system, since the driver can be expected as less attentive. To quantify lateral deviation in this scenario a test was run at 50 km/h with 12 unaware drivers in a heavy truck. Brakes were configured to emulate <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> on split-μ. Results show that the produced maximum lateral deviation from the original direction was 0. 25 m on average. Two drivers deviated by 0. 5 m. This {{can be compared to}} 2. 2 m which was reached when steering was held fixed...|$|R
