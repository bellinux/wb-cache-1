5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam <b>administration</b> <b>are</b> {{expected to have a}} substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} <b>administration</b> <b>are</b> {{considered to be}} equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E

5|$|The WHT is {{operated}} by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING), together with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope and 1.0m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope. Offices and <b>administration</b> <b>are</b> located an hour's drive away in Santa Cruz de La Palma, the island's capital. Funding {{is provided by the}} UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC, 65%), the Netherlands' Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO, 25%) and Spain's Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC, 10%) (2008 values). Telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding, although Spain receives an additional 20% allocation in return for use of the observatory site. Five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities. As a competitive research telescope, the WHT is heavily oversubscribed, typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available.|$|E
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those of other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of <b>Administration,</b> <b>are</b> {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E
