This <b>algesimeter</b> provides an inexpensive, precise instrument with assured validity of recordings in those biomedical areas with {{a requirement for}} repeated pain detection or ascertaining pain sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Newborns {{are exposed}} to a {{considerable}} number of painful stimuli. This study is aimed to investigate the effects of 30 % glucose solution and nonnutritive sucking on pain perception during venipuncture. Twenty-five term infants were randomized as receiving 30 % dextrose (group 1) or sterile water (group 2). Neonatal Infant Pain Scale scores, skin conductance <b>algesimeter</b> recordings, and near-infrared spectroscopy measurements were recorded during the procedure. Neonatal Infant Pain Scale and skin conduc-tance <b>algesimeter</b> results were decreased in both groups from that during venipuncture to after the procedure. Group 1 had lower Neonatal Infant Pain Scale scores compared with group 2 after venipuncture, different from the skin conductance algesi-meter, where no difference was observed between groups. In group 1, cerebral blood volume increased after venipuncture. Glu-cose does not attenuate the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale score and skin conductance <b>algesimeter</b> index during venipuncture, but it leads to a lower Neonatal Infant Pain Scale score after venipuncture unlike the skin conductance <b>algesimeter</b> index, which was not lowered...|$|E
40|$|Background: Electrodermal {{activity}} is originated from the activation of sweat glands {{in the skin}} in response to stress or other stimuli and thought to reflect {{the activity of the}} sympathetic nervous system, or physiological arousal. Though it has been studied since the late 19 th century, it still does not make the transition into everyday clinical application. Improvement of recording and analyzing measurement data has recently increased the interest for possible applications in various clinical settings- operation room, recovery and intensive care unit- where monitoring of autonomous nervous system {{activity is}} vital. Aims: This paper presents the applications of electrodermal activity measurements, in both adult and pediatric patients. Materials-methods: It especially reviews the results of studies carried out in perioperative setting and reviews their results. Conclusion: Although no final conclusion can be drawn safely, it seems that in adult populations electrodermal activity monitoring has the role of stress detector, while in pediatric populations it works more efficiently as <b>algesimeter.</b> Possible future applications in intensive care are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{designed to}} assess and compare the effects of therapeutic forms of heat and cold on the pain threshold of the normal shoulder is described. Heat and cold were both found to raise the normal pain threshold significantly, the maximum effect occurring immediately following treatment. Ice therapy was more effective than heat, but following both forms of treatment the effect rapidly declined and after thirty minutes {{there was no significant}} effect on the pain threshold. THE use of heat and cold for their analgesic properties is part of everyday practice in physiotherapy departments. Although these treatments are simple in application, they are time-consuming for patients and staff, they need expensive apparatus, and they result in increased demands for hospital transport. The continued use of such therapy is largely empirically based. In this study the effects of heat and cold on the pain threshold of both shoulders of physiotherapy students were measured and compared. METHOD The pain threshold was quantitatively assessed by means of an <b>algesimeter</b> similar to that originally used by Hardy et al. (1952) (Fig. 1). This apparatus consists of a plunger surrounded by a metal sleeve within which is mounted a steel spring. The force in kg. exerted on the tissues by a rounded plastic tip plunger 1 cm. in diameter is read from the scale, which indicates the degree of compression of the steel spring. The pain threshold was taken as the minimum pressure required to produce a sensation of pain. The pressure FIG. 1. —Algesimeter.
