40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a welding nozzle position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a weld nozzle holding link to the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} support angle. The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the <b>angle</b> <b>support.</b> These screws contact a pair of tapered friction surfaces formed on the upper portion of the welding nozzle holding link. A spring positioned between the upper portions of the support angle and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the adjustment screws, so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism. The angular relationships between the adjustment screws, the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> and the tapered friction surfaces of the weld nozzle holding link provide a geometric arrangement which permits precision adjustment of the holding link with respect to the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> and also provides a solid holding link mount which is resistant to movement from outside forces...|$|E

30|$|The initial {{configuration}} of the battery module is fully folded. Upon the dynamic compressive loading from the drop mass, the tapered cell edge and the impact guide trigger a smooth self-unfolding, aided by the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> from the bottom. The cells are freely jointed by the hinges, and the motion is quite resistance free and robust. Even when the angle guide and support are damaged, once the self-unfolding begins it would continue until the cell assembly is flattened. During the deformation process, the cells {{are designed to be}} “loading-free”, as long as the frictions are small. As shown in Fig.  2 b, during impact, the stress level in the cells is quite low; stress concentration occurs around the hinges and the top of upper cells. Most of the loadings are carried by the EAE. Therefore, the cell assembly can reach a high deformability, while the cell damage is trivial. According to necessity, additional protection components may be included in the bottom section of the module; hence, when the module self-unfolding completes, direct impact on cell surfaces is minimized.|$|E

30|$|Butterfly-shaped self-unfolding {{battery module}} is {{designed}} and tested. The {{goal is to}} achieve a controlled resistance and a large deformability, with the impact loading on battery cells being minimized. The battery cells are freely jointed {{by a set of}} hinges and initially fully folded. Upon a compressive loading, the hinges, aided by a guide from the top and an <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> from the bottom, help unfold the cells. The resistance is offered by a set of energy absorption elements (EAE) in parallel to the battery cells. The resistance and the cell motion are decoupled, so as to independently adjust the performance of battery cells and the mechanical responses of module. The resistance pressure offered by the cell assembly is a few MPa; the deformability is more than 60 %. The relatively large fluctuation of resistance pressure does not have much detrimental effect on the smooth reduction of drop-mass velocity. During impact, most of the kinetic energy is absorbed in a few ms after the initial setting period. Such a multifunctional battery module may be employed as structural components in electric vehicles, so as to lower the overall vehicle mass and increase the drive range.|$|E
40|$|Laminated {{composite}} shell {{panels are}} increasingly used in aeronautical, marine and mechanical industries {{as well as}} in other fields of modern technology because of its advance mechanical properties. It is well known that the composites have high strength to weight ratio and stiffness to weight ratio as compared to any conventional materials like concrete, metal, and wood. As the uses of the composites in different industries have increased which leads to their analysis through mathematical, experimental and/or simulation based model for accurate design and subsequent manufacturing. The mathematical model is developed based on higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) to count the exact flexure of the laminate. The buckling behaviour is evaluated based on the Green-Lagrange strain-displacement equations for in-plane strains to account the large deflections under uniform temperature loading. The nonlinear material behaviour of shape memory alloy is introduced through a marching technique. The responses are obtained using variational principle in conjunction with suitable isoparametric finite element modelling based on the MATLAB code. In addition to that, a simulation model is also being developed in ANSYS environment using ANSYS parametric design language code for laminated composites curved panel and the corresponding responses are compared with those available literatures.

40|$|We {{attempted}} to establish which applied kinematic variables significantly {{contributed to the}} efficiency of the instep kick motion in soccer. The study sample comprised 13 boys (age: 13 ± 0. 5 yrs; body mass: 41. 50 ± 8. 40 kg; body height: 151. 46 ± 5. 93 cm) from the FC Sloboda school of soccer. Each participant performed three kicks with maximum strength that were video recorded with two synchronized cameras (Casio Ex-F 1) positioned 12 m away from the place of the kick. Data were collected by analyzing the video recordings of each kick. Data processing was performed using the APAS motion analysis system (Ariel Dynamics Inc., San Diego, CA). On the basis of the forward selection method of multiple regression analysis, we determined the correlations between the prediction variables and the selected criteria (speed of the ball; p = 0. 01). On the basis of the regression coefficients, it was concluded that two variables significantly contributed to the speed of the ball: speed of the foot of the kicking leg at the time of contact with the ball (p = 0. 01) and the distance between the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> leg and center of the ball (“foot posterior displacement”) (p = 0. 01). In order to achieve the best possible technical performance and, therefore, a higher speed of the ball, soccer players must pay attention to two important elements during training.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{clinical and}} refractive results of myopic angle-supported intraocular lenses (IOLs). Design: Prospective, noncomparative case series. Participants: Twenty-one eyes of 12 patients (7 female) {{with a mean}} age of 29. 5 years and a follow-up of 24 months. the prospective study included highly myopic eyes (more than - 11. 00 diopters [D]) with spectacle-corrected visual acuity better than 20 / 200. Methods: Twenty-one eyes underwent implantation of a single-piece IOL with Z-shaped haptics for <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> (each haptic with two footplates) and an optical zone of 4. 5 mm (NuVita, Bausch & Lomb Surgical, Irvine, CA). the dioptric power of the IOL was calculated considering refraction, keratometry, and anterior chamber depth (specific nomogram), and its diameter was determined by adding 0. 5 mm to the corneal diameter. Main Outcome Measures: We evaluated the following clinical and refractive data: visual acuity without and with correction (VAsc and VAcc), spherical equivalent (SE) obtained under cycloplegia, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, keratometry, applanation tonometry, endothelial cell count, ultrasound pachymetry, gonioscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, subjective complaints, and descriptions of complications. Results: Mean postoperative VAsc was 20 / 74. Mean preoperative VAcc (20 / 50) increased to 20 / 30; 65 % gained at least two lines of VAcc, and no eye had a decrease in VAcc. Preoperative SE (- 18. 95 D) evolved to - 2. 06 D, stabilizing after one month. Iris retraction (pupil ovalization) more than 0. 5 mm was noted in eight eyes (40 %). Mean keratometry, corneal astigmatism, and ultrasound pachymetry were stable during the study (P > 0. 01). Significant endothelial cell loss was demonstrated in the second year. Gonioscopy showed 70 (87. 5 %) footplates ideally positioned with no iris depression. Reports of glare and haloes in dark environment were considered light in 80 % and not referred in 20 %, and spectacles were used for residual refraction in 75 %. Intraocular lens exchange was needed in one eye because of undersizing, and the IOL was removed in one eye because of chronic inflammatory reaction associated with ocular hypertension (this patient was excluded from the statistical analysis). Conclusions: This report demonstrates good efficacy for correction of high myopia by the phakic IOL used during the two years of follow-up. Long-term complications (safety) such as iris retraction and endothelial cell loss remain a concern. Ophthalmology 2000; 107 : 1549 - 1554 (C) 2000 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

In some sources, discrete ejections have been detected with highly relativistic velocities.

We quantify this behavior by examining knot velocity with respect to X-ray luminosity, a proxy for mass accretion rate onto the black hole.
