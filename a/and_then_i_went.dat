I was just at my house and I did {{the whole thing}} by myself. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Kubrick's {{brother-in-law}} Jan Harlan, {{the director}} was adamant the trims were {{never to be}} seen, and that he burned the negatives, which he had kept in his garage, shortly before his death. This was confirmed by former Kubrick assistant Leon Vitali: [...] "I'll tell you right now, okay, on Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Barry Lyndon, some little parts of 2001, we had thousands of cans of negative outtakes and print, which we had stored in an area at his house where we worked out of, which he personally supervised the loading of it to a truck <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> down to a big industrial waste lot and burned it. That's what he wanted." ...|$|E

Before the filming of [...] "Normal Is the Watchword", Rob Thomas informed actor Teddy Dunn, who played Duncan Kane, that he was planning remove the character from the show. Dunn {{has said that he}} was not too upset by the news, as he almost did not return for the season at all. On his role in the season, Dunn stated, [...] "And so I knew going in that I had a finite amount of episodes, so it was like any other job. It was week-to-week <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on my merry way." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{the novel}} was adapted into an {{illustrated}} hardback children's book by Janet Schulman, illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, {{and published by}} Simon & Schuster {{as part of its}} [...] "Atheneum Books for Young Readers" [...] imprint. In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she [...] "replicated Salten's language almost completely. I reread the novel a number of times <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written." [...] Doing so retained much of the novel's original lyrical feel, though the book's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the [...] "majesty and mystery" [...] found in the novel. The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches. In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf, with Frank Dolan as the reader.|$|E

The singles were followed by an album, Crazy Clown Time, which was released in November 2011 and described as an [...] "electronic blues album". The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed and performed by Lynch and Dean Hurley.|$|E

With regard to Christianity, both Zuckerberg and his wife told Pope Francis in August 2016 [...] "how much we admire his message of mercy and tenderness, and how he's found new ways to communicate with people of every faith around the world." [...] In December 2016, when asked [...] "Aren't you an atheist?" [...] {{in response to a}} Christmas Day post on Facebook, Zuckerberg responded, [...] "No. I was raised Jewish <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important." [...] As he closed his commencement address at Harvard University in May 2017, Zuckerberg shared the Jewish prayer Mi Shebeirach, which he stated he says when he faces challenges in life.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Debbie Kruger, Kelly indicated that the song took seven years to write.

2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he asked if I would be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E

But after he reforms himself he becomes a loving husband and father.|$|R

60|$|I did his behest. The company all {{stared at}} me as I passed {{straight}} among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him from the room: I ushered him into the library, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> upstairs.|$|E
