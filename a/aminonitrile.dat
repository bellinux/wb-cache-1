40|$|The Strecker {{reaction}} of acetaldehyde, NH 3, and HCN to afford alanine was studied by DFT calculations {{for the first}} time, which involves two reaction stages. In the first reaction stage, the <b>aminonitrile</b> was formed. The rate-determining step is the deprotonation of the NH 3 + group in MeCH(OH) -NH 3 + to form 1 -aminoethanol, which occurs with an activation energy barrier (Δ E ≠) of 9. 6 kcal/mol. The stereochemistry (R or S) of the <b>aminonitrile</b> product is determined at the NH 3 addition step to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. While the addition of CN − to the carbon atom of the protonated imine 7 appears to scramble the stereochemistry, the water cluster above the imine plane reinforces the CN − to attack the imine group below the plane. The enforcement hinders the scrambling. In the second stage, the <b>aminonitrile</b> transforms to alanine, where an amide Me-CH(NH 2) -C(=O) -NH 2 is the key intermediate. The rate-determining step is the hydrolysis of the cyano group of N(amino) -protonated <b>aminonitrile</b> which occurs with an Δ E ≠ value of 34. 7 kcal/mol.

40|$|The Strecker {{reaction}} {{involves the}} formation of <b>aminonitriles</b> by the reaction of an aldehyde with an amine {{in the presence of}} cyanide ions. In this work kinetic, equilibrium and synthetic measurements have been made using benzaldehyde, or 4 -nitrobenzaldehyde, as the aldehyde and benzylamine or allylamine as the amine. A side reaction involves {{the formation of}} a cyanohydrin from benzaldehyde and cyanide ion. The equilibria involved m the reaction and their pH dependence have been examined. For comparison values for the equilibrium constants for the reaction of benzaldehyde with sulfite are also reported. The syntheses and structural characterisations of N-benzylidene benzylamine, N-benzylidene allylamine and N-(4 -nitro) -benzylidene benzylamine are reported. A major part of the thesis is concerned with the kinetics and equilibria involved in the reaction of N-benzylidene benzylamine and N-benzylidene allylamine with cyanide in aqueous solutions. The results are compatible with the rate-determining step involving reaction of the corresponding iminium ions with cyanide ions. The pH profile is bell-shaped with a plateau between pH = 6. 5 and 8. 5 defined by the pK(_a) values of the iminium ions and hydrogen cyanide. pK(_a) values of 6. 14 ± 0. 1 and 6. 05 ± 0. 1 have been calculated for N- benzylidene benzyliminium and N-benzylidene allyliminium ions respectively. Rate constants for reaction of cyanide ion with these cations are 6. 70 x 10 (^ 3) and 1. 03 x 10 (^ 4) dm(^ 3) mol(^- 1) s(^- 1) respectively. The hydrolysis reactions of imines to yield benzaldehyde have also been quantitatively investigated. The relatively low reactivity found for those iminium ions may be attributed to charge delocalisation in the aromatic ring. An important aspect of the Strecker reaction is the possibility of forming enantiomerically pure products. The asymmetric catalysis by Salen metal complexes of the reaction of the imines with trimethylsilyl cyanide in organic solvents has been investigated. Various methods for the determination of the enantiomeric excess were tested and the most reliable was found to be use of camphorsulfonic acid. The reaction carried out {{in the presence of a}} Salen V(V) complex was optimised to yield <b>aminonitriles</b> in a 80 % e. e. at - 30 C and 69 % e. e. at room temperature.

40|$|Chiral alpha-ketoacids {{and their}} {{derivatives}} {{play an important}} role in organic synthesis and are widely used as inhibitors of both proteolytic enzymes as well as inhibitors of leukotriene A 4 hydrolase. Furthermore they are an integral part of important biologically active ulosonic- and sialic acids. Because of the presence of an beta-enolisable asymmetric centre, the number of methods leading to enantioenriched alpha-ketoesters are rather limited. New and efficient synthetic approaches as a solution to this problem are therefore of high interest. This thesis deals with the application of chiral and racemic glyoxylate aminonitriles in developing both a stoichiometric as an organocatalytic procedure for the synthesis of beta-substituted alpha-ketoesters. This could be realised by applying the concept of Umpolung, which enables the nucleophilic introduction of the alpha-ketoacid system.

40|$|International audienceContext. No chiral {{molecule}} has been {{detected in the}} interstellar medium (ISM) so far. Aims: A good candidate for an interstellar detection is 2 -aminopropionitrile (CH 3 CH(NH 2) CN), a {{chiral molecule}} with a C 3 H 6 N 2 formula. The first member of this series, aminoacetonitrile (H 2 NCH 2 CN), was recently detected, demonstrating {{that at least one}} <b>aminonitrile</b> exists in the ISM. Methods: Experimental spectra of 2 -aminopropionitrile have been recorded in the microwave and submm energy range (8 - 80 GHz, 150 - 660 GHz). Ab initio calculations facilitated the assignment of the ground state of the most stable conformer and its five lowest excited vibrational states. An unbiased spectral survey of the 80 - 116 GHz atmospheric window performed with the IRAM 30 m telescope was used to search for this molecule in the hot core Sgr B 2 (N). This survey was analyzed in the local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) approximation. The emission of 2 -aminopropionitrile was modeled simultaneously with the emission of all molecules known in Sgr B 2 (N), which allowed us to properly take into account line blending and avoid misassignments. Results: More than 4000 lines of the ground state and the five lowest excited vibrational states (from 185 to 375 cm- 1) were assigned in the experimental spectrum. The partition function including the vibrational contribution of these states was calculated. Only ten groups of transitions of 2 -aminopropionitrile are not severely affected by line blending in the Sgr B 2 (N) spectrum. Six of them could be considered as tentatively detected but the LTE predictions of the four remaining groups are not (or only marginally) consistent with the observed spectrum. Therefore, only an upper limit of 1. 7 × 1016 cm- 2 can be securely derived for the column density of 2 -aminopropionitrile toward Sgr B 2 (N), assuming the same source size, temperature, linewidth, and systemic velocity as for aminoacetonitrile Conclusions: 2 -aminopropionitrile is at least 1. 8 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile. A simple comparison to the pair methyl cyanide (CH 3 CN) /ethyl cyanide (CH 3 CH 2 CN) detected toward Sgr B 2 (N) suggests that 2 -aminopropionitrile should be 3. 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, which is consistent with the limit derived here.

40|$|This thesis investigates in the {{asymmetric}} synthesis of beta-Thio-alpha-Aminoacids who are containing chiral centers in alpha- und beta-position. There are different approaches towards the diastereo- und enantioselektive synthesis of these amino acids described using chiral Amines or the SAMP-/RAMP-hydrazone methodology. Nearly all retrosynthetic approaches are starting with Bromacetaldehyde-Diethylacetale, which is nucleophil substituted with thiolates. After acidic hydrolyses of the acetals the correspending sulphur-substituted aldehydes are obtained. In the first approach the aldehyde {{is transformed into}} the chiral Imine and subsequently alpha-alkylated. Because of the low diastereoselectivities this approach was stopped. In the second approach the aldehydes are now transformed into the SAMP-hydrazone and then alpha-alkylated (de = 93 - =< 96 %). Attempts to quarternise the alpha-stereogenic center yielded only moderate diastereoselectivities (de = 43 - 61 %). In a diastereoselctive Strecker-like reaktion the SAMP-hydrazones are transformed with TMSCN into the hydrazino nitriles (de = 90 - =< 96 %). Protection with Benzoylchloride and epimerisation free N,N-bound cleavage with SmI 2 resulted the protected <b>aminonitriles.</b> Unhappily, no method could be found to transform the nitriles into the correspondending amino acids neither under acidic nor under basic conditions. Only decomposition can be observed. Nevertheless, the sulfidic group of the alpha-sulfanylated <b>aminonitriles</b> can be oxidized to the sulfones or the amino group can be protected a second time with Boc, without decomposition. As {{an alternative to the}} Strecker-like reaction with TMSCN the addition of metallated Dithian to the C,N-doublebond of the SAMP-hydrazone has been tested. In this reaction only moderate diastereomeric accesses (de = 59 %) could be achieved, although the reacti conditions have to be optimized. The third approach started with Brompyruvicacid-Ethylester. The ketoester is transformed into the SAMP-hydrazone and then alpha-alkylated with high diastereomeric selectivity (de = 90 - =< 96 %).

Reactivity of the model cofactor (mLTQ: 4 -butylamino- 5 -methyl-o-quinone), with each of two ureides, semicarbazide (SC) and thiosemicarbazide (TSC), and each of two <b>aminonitriles,</b> aminoacetonitrile (AAN) and beta-aminopropionitrile (betaAPN), was assessed using UV-vis spectrophotometry; both in the absence and presence of Cu(II) -bipyridine (bipy) complex. Two sets of mixture toxicity experiments were conducted using a frog embryo assay that assessed the incidence of osteolathyrism in the notochord of tadpoles after 96 -h exposure. The resulting concentration-response curves for each set were evaluated (chi(2) goodness-of-fit test) against theoretical curves for two combined effects models: dose-addition and independence, to determine the combined effect of each osteolathyrogen combination. The agents SC, TSC and AAN each showed rapid, irreversible reactivity with mLTQ, both in the absence and presence of Cu(II) -bipy complex, as indicated by bleaching of the mLTQ peak (504 nm) and formation of an adduct at 350 nm. betaAPN showed no apparent reactivity {{in the absence of}} prolonged incubation with mLTQ, whether Cu(II) -bipy complex was present or not. After prolonged incubation (24 - 144 h) a new peak formed at 350 nm, suggesting that betaAPN reacts weakly with the cofactor, but in a manner different from the other agents examined. The toxicity tests indicated a dose-additive combined effect for the SC:TSC, AAN:SC and AAN:SC:TSC mixtures (0. 1 < P < 0. 9; with slope and EC 50 additivity quotient values between 0. 93 - 1. 14), suggesting these agents induce osteolathyrism via a common mechanism. The betaAPN:SC and betaAPN: SC:TSC mixtures. showed a greater-than dose-additive combined effect (P < 0. 001; slope and EC 50 additivity quotient values from 0. 74 to 0. 89), suggesting a different or additional mechanism of osteolathyrism for βAPN. Taken together the results indicate that SC, TSC and AAN induce osteolathyrism primarily, if not completely, by binding to the LO cofactor, thereby inhibiting proper connective tissue fiber cross-linking. While βAPN also has the potential to react with the cofactor, the nature of the reactivity observed suggests that βAPN-cofactor binding is, at best, a secondary mechanism for induction of osteolathyrism in vivo...|$|R

For the cyanosilylation of imines, most of the reactions were complete within 1 h affording <b>aminonitriles</b> in quantitative yield. Kaskel and coworkers carried out similar cyanosilylation reactions with coordinatively unsaturated metals in three-dimensional (3D) MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts. The 3D framework Cu3(btc)2(H2O)3 (btc: Benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylate) (HKUST-1) {{used in this study}} was first reported by Williams et al. The open framework of Cu3(btc)2(H2O)3 is built from dimeric cupric tetracarboxylate units (paddle-wheels) with aqua molecules coordinating to the axial positions and btc bridging ligands. The resulting framework after removal of two water molecules from axial positions possesses porous channel. This activated MOF catalyzes the trimethylcyanosilylation of benzaldehydes with a very low conversion (<5% in 24 h) at 293 K. As the reaction temperature was raised to 313 K, a good conversion of 57% with a selectivity of 89% was obtained after 72 h. In comparison, less than 10% conversion was observed for the background reaction (without MOF) under the same conditions. But this strategy suffers from some problems like 1) the decomposition of the framework with increase of the reaction temperature due to the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by aldehydes; 2) strong solvent inhibition effect; electron donating solvents such as THF competed with aldehydes for coordination to the Cu(II) sites, and no cyanosilylation product was observed in these solvents; 3) the framework instability in some organic solvents. Several other groups have also reported the use of metal centres in MOFs as catalysts Again, electron-deficient nature of some metals and metal clusters makes the resulting MOFs efficient oxidation catalysts. Mori and coworkers reported MOFs with Cu2 paddle wheel units as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols. The catalytic activity of the resulting MOF was examined by carrying out alcohol oxidation with H2O2 as the oxidant. It also catalyzed the oxidation of primary alcohol, secondary alcohol and benzyl alcohols with high selectivity.

In this work, adamantane derivatives have been synthesized on the basis of their activity in tubulin polymerization and the evaluated as trypanocidal agents. The above series of compounds involves the following : 1. Adamantane imidazolines: 1. 1 2 -Alkyl- and 2 -aminospiroimidazolines 1 and 2 : The imidazolines 1 and 2 are derived on condension of amidines or by treatment with cyanogen bromide.

The respective diamines are synthesized by application of the Strecker reaction on 1 -adamantanecarboxylaldehyde. 2. Adamantane oxazolines: 2. 1 Spirooxazolines 19 : The oxazolines 19 were obtained from the respective N-(2 -hydroxy- 2 -adamantylmethyl) acylamides by cyclization in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid. 2. 2 5 -(1 -Adamantyl) - 5 -methyl- 2 -oxazolines 24 : The synthesis of exocyclic oxazolines 24 is similar to that of oxazolines 19. The requisite amides are afforded by reduction of the cyanohydrin of 1 -adamantyl,methylketone and subsequent N-acylation of the intermediate aminoalcohol. 2. 3 Adamantane 2 -amino- 2 -oxazolines 33, 34 and 35 : In these compounds, the conjunction of the ring of 2 -amino- 2 - oxazolines with the adamantane nucleus is spirocyclic (33) or exocyclic (34) or the rings of the two molecules are fused (35). The synthetic route to the later compounds involves cyclization of the respective N-(2 -hydroxyalcyl) ureas. 2. 4 Spirocyclic 4, 4 -bisubstituted 2 -oxazolines 46 : The synthesis of oxazolines 46 is realized by hydroxymethylation of 2 -nitroadamantane, reduction of the intermediate 2 -nitroalcohol and conversion of the produced 2 -aminoalcohol into the corresponding amides. Treatment with tosyl chloride leads to oxazolines 46. This work involves also the synthesis of trimethylspirooxazoline 61, which is obtained via treatment of 2 -acetylamino- 2 -adamatylcarboxylic methylester with methylmagnesium iodide and cyclization of the formed unstable hydroxyamide. 3. 1 -Amino- and 1 -methylamino- 2 -adamantane alcohols 52 : Alcohol 52 α is derived by application of Curtius rearrangement of the azide of 2 -oxo- 1 -adamantylcarboxylic acid and reduction of the Adamantane imidazolines and oxazolines of pharmacological interest 186 intermediate 1 -amino- 2 -adamantanone. The N-methyl analog 52 b is afforded by reduction of the N-ethoxycarbonyl-derivative of aminoalcohol 52 α. Τhe pharmacological evaluation, which is in progress, infers that the spirocyclic oxazolines 19 inhibit tubulin polymerization, while the exocyclic imidazolines 8 and 9 are trypanocidal. It is possible that the trypanocidal activity of the imidazolines 8 and 9 is not related to the tubulin polymerization.

Several other groups have also reported the use of metal centres in MOFs as catalysts Coordination Site |year=2008 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=130 |page=5854 |doi=10.1021/ja800669j |last1=Horike |first1=Satoshi |last2=Dincǎ |first2=Mircea |last3=Tamaki |first3=Kentaro |last4=Long |first4=Jeffrey R. |issue=18 |pmid=18399629}} Again, electron-deficient nature of some metals and metal clusters makes the resulting MOFs efficient oxidation catalysts. Mori and coworkers reported MOFs with Cu2 paddle wheel units as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols. The catalytic activity of the resulting MOF was examined by carrying out alcohol oxidation with H2O2 as the oxidant. It also catalyzed the oxidation of primary alcohol, secondary alcohol and benzyl alcohols with high selectivity.
