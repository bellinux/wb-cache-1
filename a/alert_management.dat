If performance deterioration is not verifiable by using such acclaimed tools of these disciplines, then the advocacy of these disciplines is untenable and their contribution is overstated.

The system is designed to warn drivers about potential traffic violations by emitting acoustical messages through vehicle loudspeakers. These messages are issued with sufficient notice to provide the driver with enough time to react to the oncoming traffic situation. However, when a traffic violation is committed, the corresponding offence information such as vehicle speed, GPS location, and other driving parameters, are saved in a database for off-line analysis. In addition, an auxiliary application permits the registered traffic violations to be represented as a standard Google Earth map. The prototype was tested in a real scene under different lighting conditions and showed reasonable results. No data (2011...|$|R

40|$|Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are {{designed}} to monitor a networked environment and generate alerts whenever abnormal activities are detected. The number of these alerts can be very large making their evaluation by security analysts a difficult task. The management {{is complicated by the}} need to configure the different components of alert evaluation systems. In addition, IDS <b>alert</b> <b>management</b> techniques, such as clustering and correlation, suffer from involving unrelated alerts in their processes and consequently provide results that are inaccurate and difficult to manage. Thus, the tuning of an IDS <b>alert</b> <b>management</b> system in order to provide optimal results remains a major challenge, which is further complicated by the large spectrum of potential attacks the system can be subject to. This thesis considers the specification and configuration issues of FuzMet, a novel IDS <b>alert</b> <b>management</b> system which employs several metrics and a fuzzy-logic based approach for scoring and prioritizing alerts. In addition, it features an alert rescoring technique that leads to a further reduction of the number of alerts. We study the impact of different configurations of the proposed metrics on the accuracy and completeness of the alert scores generated by FuzMet. Our approach is validated using the 2000 DARPA intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and comparative results between the Snort IDS alert scoring and FuzMet alert prioritization scheme are presented. A considerable number of simulations were conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal configuration of FuzMet with selected simulation results presented and analyzed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Alert</b> <b>management</b> plays a {{critical}} role in many application domains including homeland security and natural disaster management, to allow timely and well-informed decisions. The major challenge faced by these systems is that the number of incoming alarms is overwhelming and some of the alarms are false positives. In this paper, we present an <b>alert</b> <b>management</b> system (AMS) that generates meaningful alerts from alarms received from different sensors. The alert generation module of our system (i) flags and eliminates potential false positives by characterizing the region into uniformly behaving neighborhoods, (ii) generates aggregated alerts from the alarms by employing density based clustering techniques and identifying the overlap among clusters, and (iii) identifies the dynamic flow of the alerts by integrating scientific models that characterize the behavior of sensor parameters. Once the alerts are generated our customized dissemination module disperses the alerts on the need-to-know basis to the individuals and agencies involved. This module adheres to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the National Response plan (NRP) protocols. To implement these protocols, we utilize the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), which is an XML nonproprietary data interchange format. Finally, our GIS module displays the alerts through a user-friendly interface. 1...|$|E
40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} {{is not new}} in {{the area}} of information security. It is crucial for the intrusion <b>alerts</b> <b>management</b> system to correlate the collected intrusion alerts to reflect the causal relationships between the attack steps and construct the attack scenarios. Most of these systems, however, have been built on the relational database logging the intrusion alerts. The relational database has been proven to be a very useful model and applied in the wide area. But their persisting limitation lies in the flat structure which is not capable of representing the complex relations. An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization using an agreed vocabulary. In this paper, ontology is put into use and a learning framework is presented which depicts how the intrusion alerts ontology can be learned and further enriched exploiting both the database schema and the stored data. Moreover, we introduce the vulnerabilities database to refine the ontology hierarchy and the restriction of classes and apply the ontology design pattern to represent the sequence of a series of events.
