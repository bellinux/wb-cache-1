5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> Earth rise in the distance.

Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms.

5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Games, {{officials}} anticipated {{two million}} tourists, of which one-third would be from overseas. However, actual volume of visitors fell 9.2% year-on-year.
