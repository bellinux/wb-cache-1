500|$|Betty's two passions in {{life are}} darts and food. Playing darts brings out her {{competitive}} side, and she enjoys beating her male customers.

Ultimately, Betty stops trying to lose weight, stating: [...] "I had to [...] between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry <b>a</b> <b>skinny</b> rabbit he'd have married one." [...] Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: [...] "Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers – she couldn't face life alone at home". Little has observed that Betty [...] "has a finely tuned {{sense of right and}} wrong and has never been afraid to stand up for her beliefs", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the NSPCC to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was <b>a</b> <b>skinny</b> animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
500|$|Bissell {{was born}} on December 1, 1957 in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The family lived in Palos Park, Illinois for several years. His father was a computer-systems designer with Hiram Walker Inc. Bissell was an athlete who enjoyed performing feats of daring: at the age of 8 he jumped off a -high diving board, even though {{he did not know how}} to swim. He dabbled in many sports baseball, basketball, football, track, etc. He was introduced to ballet at age ten by his sister Susan who paid him to be her ballet partner; thus he was first paid to dance. He found a home and sanctuary in the passion of ballet and decided to make it his life pursuit. He began training in ballet and jazz dance and was soon accepted into a company in Toledo, Ohio. Like many boys who take up ballet, he tried to keep his lessons a secret, but word got out and he was ridiculed and bullied every single day for the rest of his school days.

500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just <b>a</b> <b>skinny</b> kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E

2500|$|The {{competing}} implosion-type {{design is}} considerably {{more efficient and}} uses much less fuel to reach any given explosive power. Implosion designs are necessarily spherical, and thus less suitable for inclusion in <b>a</b> <b>skinny</b> fuselage like Nike's. In order to use an implosion warhead, Bell also proposed a much more modified design known as [...] "Nike Hercules". This featured an enlarged upper fuselage able to carry the XW-7 warhead of up to 40kt. In spite of the greatly increased explosive power, the WX-7 was only slightly heavier than the WX-9, about 950 pounds for common XW-7 versions, as opposed to 850 pounds for the XW-9.|$|E

This sprawling novel was warmly received and established Franzen as an author to watch.

During the main event of the night, [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper served as special guest referee for the second WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. During this Lawler began making disparaging remarks about him. Lawler would continue to berate Piper on later episodes of Monday Night Raw, including bringing <b>a</b> <b>skinny</b> kid into the ring dressed as Piper and forcing him to kiss his feet. This ultimately led to a match between the two at King of the Ring 1994 which Lawler lost.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s skateparks hadn't been invented yet, so {{skateboard}}ers would flock and skateboard in such urban places as The Escondido reservoir in San Diego, California. Skateboarding magazine would publish {{the location and}} Skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir. Many companies started to manufacture trucks (axles) specially designed for skateboarding, reached in 1976 by Tracker Trucks. As the equipment became more maneuverable, the decks started to get wider, reaching widths of [...] and over, thus giving the skateboarder even more control. A banana board is <b>a</b> <b>skinny,</b> flexible skateboard made of polypropylene with ribs on the underside for structural support. [...] These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in a myriad of colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.|$|E

His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, bloodshot eyes, and a high ponytail. The stitches on his lips were given to him because he cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is a part of him, so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E
