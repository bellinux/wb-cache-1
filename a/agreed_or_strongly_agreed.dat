40|$|ObBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate perceptions regarding current practices in the care of diabetic inpatients as well as the knowledge and attitudes of nursing and medical caregivers at a large secondary hospital. DESIGN AND METHODS: Doctors and nurses taking care of diabetic inpatients were surveyed to assess their knowledge of diabetes inpatient management and their attitudes towards diabetic patients. The survey made use of the diabetes knowledge questionnaire (O'Brien) and the DAS 3 scale. RESULTS: The survey group comprised 115 health care providers, of whom 54 were doctors and 61 were nurses. The response rate was 82 %. The doctors achieved a mean score of 68. 3 % (standard deviation (SD) 11. 5 %) and the nurses 53. 9 % (SD 16. 3 %) for the diabetes knowledge questionnaire. The DAS 3 questionnaire indicated that 80. 9 % of health care personnel <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that special training for managing diabetic patients is necessary, 90. 5 % <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that type 2 diabetes is a serious condition, 92. 2 % <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that tight glycaemic control is valuable, 85. 2 % <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that diabetes has a significant psychosocial impact on patients, and 88. 7 % <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that patients should have autonomy regarding their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers (doctors and nurses) in a large secondary hospital have average to poor knowledge about the care of diabetic inpatients.

40|$|It is {{predicted}} that the earth’s climate will change because of the buildup of greenhouse gases. However, the exact effect of these gases on the climate is difficult to predict. Given these conditions, what do rural Nebraskans think about global climate change? Do they think global climate change will impact them? What are their opinions about the causes and effects of global climate change? This paper provides {{a detailed analysis of}} these questions. This report details 2, 496 responses to the 2008 Nebraska Rural Poll, the thirteenth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked a series of questions about global climate change. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, that is, comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	Most rural Nebraskans report that they understand the issue of global climate change either fairly or very well. Twenty-one percent say they understand the issue very well and one-half (50 %) understand it fairly well. Three percent say they don’t understand the issue at all and 22 percent answered “not very well. ” Four percent are unsure. •	Rural Nebraskans are most concerned about global climate change impacting the United States. Over one-half (60 %) are concerned or very concerned about global climate change impacting the United States. Fifty-two percent are concerned or very concerned about climate change impacting Nebraska and one-half (50 %) are concerned or very concerned about it impacting their family. Less than one-half of rural Nebraskans are concerned or very concerned about climate change impacting their community (48 %) or other countries (49 %). •	Most rural Nebraskans believe climate change is already happening. Over one-half (58 %) of rural Nebraskans believe climate change is already happening. Seventeen percent are not sure about their views. Twelve percent think climate change will not happen in their lifetime but will affect future generations. One percent think climate change will happen {{in the next few years}} and seven percent say it will happen in their lifetime. Five percent say climate change will never happen. •	Most rural Nebraskans believe that our actions contribute to global climate change. Sixty-five percent of rural Nebraskans <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “human activity, including industry and transportation, is a significant cause of climate change. ” Fourteen percent disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with the statement and 22 percent neither agree nor disagree. Similarly, just over one-half (51 %) of rural Nebraskans <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “global climate change is something people can control. ” Just under one-quarter (23 %) disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with that statement and 26 percent neither agree nor disagree. •	Most rural Nebraskans believe that we need to make changes in our behaviors to reduce the impacts of global climate change. The majority (84 %) of rural Nebraskans <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “we will have to change our lifestyles to reduce energy consumption. ” Only six percent disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with that statement. And, 70 percent <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “it is my responsibility to help reduce the impacts of global climate change. ” Only nine percent disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree while 21 percent neither agree nor disagree. •	Most rural Nebraskans think change is required to solve global climate change. Just over one-half (53 %) <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “global climate change requires immediate action by the government. ” Twenty-one percent disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with the statement and just over one-quarter (27 %) neither agree nor disagree. Most rural Nebraskans (65 %) disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree that “we will do nothing since global climate change is not a problem. ” Only 11 percent <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> and just under one-quarter (24 %) neither agree nor disagree with the statement. Forty-five percent of rural Nebraskans disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree that “global climate change is a problem but the U. S. won’t do anything about it. ” Twenty-one percent <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> with the statement and approximately one-third (34 %) neither agree nor disagree. •	Opinions are mixed regarding whether or not too much fuss is made about global climate change. One-half (50 %) of rural Nebraskans disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with the statement “too much fuss is made about global climate change. ” Thirty percent <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> with the statement and 21 percent neither agree nor disagree. •	Opinions are mixed on whether or not technologies can be developed to solve the problem of global climate change. Forty-two percent of rural Nebraskans <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “firms and government researchers will develop new technologies to solve the problem. ” One-quarter (25 %) disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree and approximately one-third (34 %) neither agree nor disagree with the statement. •	Opinions are mixed on whether or not current climate change is due to normal climate patterns. Over one-third (37 %) of rural Nebraskans <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that “current climate change is due to normal climate patterns. ” However, 34 percent disagree <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with the statement. Twenty-nine percent neither agree nor disagree. •	Persons with agriculture occupations are more likely than persons with different occupations to agree that too much fuss is made about global climate change. Forty-four percent of persons with occupations in agriculture agree with this statement, compared to 19 percent of persons with food service or personal care occupations or persons with healthcare support or public safety occupations. •	Persons with agriculture occupations are more likely than persons with different occupations to agree that current climate change is due to normal climate patterns.

Students indicate their answer to the instructor using an audience response system, and then they discuss with their fellow students why they chose a particular answer, trying to explain to one another their underlying thinking. The instructor then asks the question again to see the new student results. [...] The study authors used scanned forms and hand-raising for audience response in the initial year of the study, and then they switched to a computer-based audience response system in the following years.

50|$|China {{has four}} tiers in its {{healthcare}} system. The first tier is street health and workplace clinics {{and these are}} cheaper than hospitals in terms of medical billing and act as prevention centers. The second tier is district and enterprise hospitals along with specialist clinics and these provide the second level of care. The third tier is provisional and municipal general hospitals and teaching hospitals which provided the third level of care. In a tier of its own is the national hospitals which are governed by the Ministry of Health. China has been greatly improving its health informatics since it finally opened its doors {{to the outside world}} and joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2001, it was reported that China had 324,380 medical institutions and the majority of those were clinics. The reason for that is that clinics are prevention centers and Chinese people like using traditional Chinese medicine as opposed to Western medicine and it usually works for the minor cases. China has also been improving its higher education in regards to health informatics. At the end of 2002, there were 77 medical universities and medical colleges. There were 48 university medical colleges which offered bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees in medicine. There were 21 higher medical specialty institutions that offered diploma degrees so in total, there were 147 higher medical and educational institutions. Since joining the WTO, China has been working hard to improve its education system and bring it up to international standards.SARS played a large role in China quickly improving its healthcare system. Back in 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS and that made China hurry to spread HIS or Hospital Information System and more than 80% of hospitals had HIS. China had been comparing itself to Korea's healthcare system and figuring out how it can better its own system. There was a study done that surveyed six hospitals in China that had HIS. The results were that doctors didn't use computers as much so it was concluded that it wasn't used as much for clinical practice than it was for administrative purposes. The survey asked if the hospitals created any websites and it was concluded that only four of them had created websites and that three had a third-party company create it for them and one was created by the hospital staff. In conclusion, all of them <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> that providing health information on the Internet should be utilized.|$|E

The main reasons for patients to report ADRs were to share their experiences (89 % <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> to the statement), {{the severity of the}} reaction (86 % <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed),</b> worries about their own situation (63. 2 % <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed)</b> and the fact the ADR was not mentioned in the patient information leaflet (57. 6 % <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed).</b> Of the patient-responders, 93. 8 % shared the opinion that reporting an ADR can prevent harm to other people, 97. 9 % believed that reporting contributes to research and knowledge, 90. 7 % stated that they felt responsible for reporting an ADR and 92. 5 % stated that they will report a possible ADR once again in the future. CONCLUSION: The main motives for patients to report their ADRs to a pharmacovigilance centre were the severity of the ADR and their need to share experiences. The high level of response to the questionnaire shows that patients are involved when it comes to ADRs and that they are also willing to share their motivations for and opinions about the reporting of ADRs with a pharmacovigilance centre...|$|E
30|$|Most workers {{report that}} they receive the {{benefits}} and pay {{they are supposed to}} get for their work. However, there is substantial variation in the share of workers who report access to opportunities for training and progression. In the case of training, casual workers, the self-employed, and family workers are all much less likely than private employees to report receiving the opportunities they need to perform their jobs well, while government employees {{are much more likely to}} report such opportunities. In the case of progression/promotion opportunities, 80 – 90 % of all types of workers, except casual workers, {{report that they}} <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that they have access to such opportunities.|$|R
30|$|Analyses were {{conducted}} with STATA version 13.0 and 14.0 and Mplus version 7.11. Descriptive statistics were generated for each item {{to determine the extent}} of missing values and to demonstrate the range of responses by providing difficulty estimates within and across the nine scales. For scales with disagree/agree response options, the relative strength of an item (how difficult it is to score highly) was calculated as the proportion responding disagree and strongly disagree (low scores) as against <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> (high scores). For scales with response options cannot do to very easy, the difficulty level was calculated as the proportion responding cannot do, very difficult, or quite difficult as against quite easy and very easy (Raykov and Marcoulides 2011).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} effect of {{storytelling}} on hospice care learning in the interest group. Methods: Storytelling was used among 7 master of science in nursing (MSN) students in the hospice care interest group. The effect of storytelling was evaluated by the combination of students' reflect diary and the evaluation form. Results: Five themes were extracted from diary including: relieving {{the suffering of the}} patients, understanding and respecting patients' choice, communicating, team working, and family supporting. Among 5 items of the evaluation form, there were 4 items which were scored as either <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>agree.</b> Conclusions: Students reflected that the storytelling helped them recognize the importance of relieving the suffering, respecting and understanding, communicating, team working, and family supporting in the hospice care...|$|R
