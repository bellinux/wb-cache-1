5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> sexual education. They <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Institute for Public Policy Research, a UK {{think tank}} {{associated}} with the Labour Party, advocated a job creation program - with compulsory takeup, on pain of loss of benefits - for the long-term unemployed only. The Labour Party under Ed Miliband subsequently went into the 2015 general election with a promise to implement an even more limited Job Guarantee (specifically, part time jobs with guaranteed training included for long-term unemployed youth) if elected; however, they lost the election. This is still Labour Party policy - however, they <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> universal basic income as a possible alternative policy.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, the Canadian {{government}} decided that F-35 costs were {{much higher than}} earlier anticipated and hence <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the Eurofighter as well as four other fighters to replace their ageing CF-18s. In January 2014 it seemed unlikely that a decision on a replacement would be taken before the next federal election in October 2015. This election occurred, and while Canada was leaning more towards US fighters like the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet or back to the F-35, as of June 2017 protectionist rhetoric by the US government (and a trade complaint by Boeing against Bombardier) has caused the Canadian government to stop discussions about acquiring the Super Hornet and look at other, potentially non-US options.|$|E
25|$|Challenges {{based on}} equal {{protection}} arguments are similarly difficult to sustain. Here courts <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{whether there is}} a rational purpose for treating pit bull breeds differently from other dog breeds. Dog owners have attacked the rational purpose requirement by arguing either that BSL is over-inclusive, because it bans all dogs of a breed when only certain individuals within the breed have proven to be vicious, or under-inclusive, because many types of dogs have injured people and the BSL fails to include those other breeds. However, again under minimum scrutiny review, BSL will survive as long as the government can establish that the BSL is rationally related to its purpose, even if the law is found to be over-inclusive or under-inclusive.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid {{technology}} for buses has seen increased attention since recent battery developments decreased battery weight significantly. Drivetrains consist of conventional diesel engines and gas turbines. Some designs concentrate on using car engines, recent designs {{have focused on}} using conventional diesel engines already used in bus designs, to save on engineering and training costs. Several manufacturers are currently working on new hybrid designs, or hybrid drivetrains that fit into existing chassis offerings without major re-design. A challenge to hybrid buses may still come from cheaper lightweight imports from the former Eastern block countries or China, where national operators <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> fuel consumption issues surrounding {{the weight of the}} bus, which has increased with recent bus technology innovations such as glazing, air conditioning and electrical systems. A hybrid bus can also deliver fuel economy though through the hybrid drivetrain. Hybrid technology is also being promoted by environmentally concerned transit authorities.|$|E
25|$|Though {{companies}} were hired {{for work on}} the pilot episode—such as Entity FX for the visual effects—effects departments now work exclusively for the series. Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director {{make sure that the}} scenes are being filmed in the best way for the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors. Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature, though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story. In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.|$|E
25|$|As of October 24, 2014, {{the film}} was set to start {{production}} {{in the spring of}} 2015. On February 25, 2015, it was reported that Jack Huston would be starring in the film. On March 14, 2015, O'Barr confirmed to Dread Central at the Lexington Comic and Toy Convention that Huston had been cast as Draven in the reboot, and at a Q during the convention he further confirmed that Jessica Brown Findlay had been cast as Shelly Webster. On May 20, 2015, Deadline reports that Andrea Riseborough is in talks to co-star as the female version of Top Dollar. On June 15, 2015, according to Variety reported two stories: Forest Whitaker is in negotiations for a role and Huston has dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, but Relativity Studios <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Nicholas Hoult and Jack O'Connell for the role of Draven. On July 31, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that production on the reboot stalled because of Relativity Media's bankruptcy. O'Barr told comicbook.com in an interview that the film will still happen. TheWrap reported that filming on the reboot was going to start in March 2016 with Corin Hardy on board as director, but Hardy dropped out on the film. On June 15, 2016, Deadline reports that Hardy may return to the reboot. On August 10, 2016, Jason Momoa is reporting in talks to star in the film as he post a photo of him with Hardy who's still going to direct the reboot on his Instagram account. On September 6, 2016, TheWrap reports that Momoa is cast and filming will begin in January 2017. On November 17, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Davis Films, Highland Film Group, and Electric Shadow have acquired the rights to finance, produce, and distribute the film now titled The Crow Reborn from Relativity but may lose both Momoa and Hardy. In September 2017, it was announced that Sony will distribute the film.|$|E
