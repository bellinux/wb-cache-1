2500|$|Cassettes {{remained}} {{popular for}} specific applications, such as car audio and telephone answering machines, {{well into the}} 1990s. Cassettes and their players were typically more rugged and resistant to dust, heat, and shocks than the main digital competitor, the CD. Their lower fidelity was not considered a serious drawback. However, the advent of [...] "shock proof" [...] buffering technology in CD players, the general heightening of consumer expectations, {{and the introduction of}} CD auto-changers meant that, by the early 2000s, the CD player rapidly replaced the cassette player as the default <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> in the majority of new vehicles in Europe and America. The last new car with an available cassette player was a 2010 Lexus SC 430.|$|E
2500|$|WTVR-TV {{shut down}} its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, {{in the late}} morning of June 12, 2009, after more than 60 years, the {{official}} date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers continues to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6.1. [...] Prior to the transition, the <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> of WTVR's analog channel 6 signal at 87.75MHz had been heavily promoted as available to listeners tuning to 87.7 on a standard FM radio receiver. WTVR lost this benefit of the analog channel 6 allocation when analog transmission ended. WTVR showed the Star Spangled Banner with Images of WTVR-TV's History, {{as well as the}} Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.|$|E
5000|$|DIY audio {{can also}} involve [...] "tweaking" [...] of mass market {{components}}. It {{is thought that}} mass market audio components are compromised {{by the use of}} cheap or inferior internal parts that can be easily replaced with high quality substitutes. As a result, an <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> of improved characteristics may be obtained for relatively low cost. Some common changes include replacing opamps, replacing capacitors (recap), or even replacing resistors in order to increase signal-to-noise ratio. Changing an <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> in this way is similar to what a tweaker or modder does with a personal computer.|$|E

50|$|Subjective {{evaluation}} {{attempts to}} measure how well an <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> performs according to the human ear. The {{most common form of}} subjective test is a listening test, where the <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> is simply used in the context for which it was designed. This test is popular with hi-fi reviewers, where the component is used for a length of time by the reviewer who then will describe the performance in subjective terms. Common descriptions include whether the component has a 'bright' or 'dull' sound, or how well the component manages to present a 'spatial image'.|$|E

50|$|The tuner {{can also}} {{refer to a}} radio {{receiver}} or standalone <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> {{that are part of}} an audio system, to be connected to a separate amplifier.

50|$|In RF-transmitted {{composite}} video, subcarriers {{remain in}} the baseband signal after main carrier demodulation to be separated in the receiver. The mono <b>audio</b> <b>component</b> of the transmitted signal is in a separate carrier and not integral to the video component. In wired video connections, composite video retains the integrated subcarrier signal structure found in the transmitted baseband signal, while S-Video places the chrominance and luminance subcarriers on separate wires to eliminate subcarrier crosstalk and enhance the signal bandwidth and strength (picture sharpness and brightness).|$|E
