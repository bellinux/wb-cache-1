40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the way in}} which payments from pooled annuity funds need to be adjusted to take account of the fact that future mortality rates are uncertain. Mortalityadjusted annuities, as we describe payments from the pooled fund are variable annuities in which aggregate mortality risk is transferred from the seller of annuitees to the <b>annuitants.</b> If <b>annuitants</b> are risk averse the payments from the fund should be adjusted to reflect this. We show how the adjustment can be calculated and compare the payment profiles from a risk-adjusted funds with alternatives which either ignore uncertainty completely or take account of the uncertainty but assume that <b>annuitants</b> are not risk averse. It is shown that, even for very risk averse <b>annuitants,</b> initial payments are reduced only slightly to provide acceptable insurance against the implications of uncertainty about future mortality rates. ...|$|R

This accounts for unexpected longevity improvements experienced by a given reference population. The approach described in the present paper is in contrast with Group Self-Annuitization where <b>annuitants</b> bear their own risk. Here, the <b>annuitants</b> only bear the non-diversifiable risk that the future mortality trend departs from that of the reference forecast. In that respect, the life annuities discussed in this paper are substitutes for reinsurance and securitization of longevity risk...|$|R

From such ideas one passes very readily to the conception of guild-managed businesses in which the factor of capital would no longer stand out as an element distinct from and contrasted with the proprietorship of the workers. One sees the worker as an active and intelligent helper during the great portion of his participation, and as an <b>annuitant</b> and perhaps, if he has devised economies and improvements, a receiver of royalties during his declining years.|$|E
60|$|The {{existing}} tax [in England] treats {{all kinds}} of incomes exactly alike,(339) taking its [fivepence] in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder, stockholder, or mortgagee, who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants. This is a visible injustice; yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation {{ought to be in}} proportion to means. When it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one, the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less: for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years, while that which lasts forever pays forever. The claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic, but of human wants and feelings. It is not because the temporary <b>annuitant</b> has smaller means, but because he has greater necessities, that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate.|$|E

60|$|Well, Mr. Brough pitied {{the poor}} love-sick swain, {{as he called}} me, so much, and felt such a warm sympathy in my well-being, that he insisted on my going down to Somersetshire {{with a couple of}} months' leave; and away I went, as happy as a lark, with a couple of brand-new suits from Von Stiltz's in my trunk (I had them made, looking forward to a certain event), and inside the trunk Lieutenant Smith's fleecy hosiery; {{wrapping}} up a parcel of our prospectuses and two letters from John Brough, Esq., to my mother our worthy <b>annuitant,</b> and to Mrs. Hoggarty our excellent shareholder. Mr. Brough said I was all that the fondest father could wish, that he considered me as his own boy, and that he earnestly begged Mrs. Hoggarty not to delay the sale of her little landed property, as land was high now and must fall; whereas the West Diddlesex Association shares were (comparatively) low, and must inevitably, {{in the course of a}} year or two, double, treble, quadruple their present value.|$|E

The rate of interest, therefore, on good security, which alone we have here to consider (for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount), is seldom, in the great centers of money transactions, precisely the same for two days together; as is shown by the never-ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities. Nevertheless, there must be, as in other cases of value, some rate which (in the language of Adam Smith and Ricardo) may be called the natural rate; some rate about which the market rate oscillates, and to which it always tends to return. This rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings, and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry, or for the leisure, ease, and independence of an <b>annuitant.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} the nominal {{equality}} of income, A, an <b>annuitant</b> of £1,000 a year, can not so well afford to pay £100 out of it as B, who derives the same annual sum from heritable property; A having usually a demand on his income which B has not, namely, to provide by saving for children or others; to which, {{in the case of}} salaries or professional gains, must generally be added a provision for his own later years; while B may expend his whole income without injury to his old age, and still have it all to bestow on others after his death. If A, in order to meet these exigencies, must lay by £300 of his income, to take £100 from him as income-tax is to take £100 from £700, since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption. Were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves, abating £70 from his consumption and £30 from his annual saving, then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as B’s; but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax. The capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less, and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income-tax; while B’s heirs would only be charged once.|$|E

5000|$|A pure {{life annuity}} ceases to make {{payments}} {{on the death of}} the <b>annuitant.</b> A guaranteed annuity or life and certain annuity, makes payments for at least a certain number of years (the [...] "period certain"); if the <b>annuitant</b> outlives the specified period certain, annuity payments then continue until the annuitant's death, and if the <b>annuitant</b> dies before the expiration of the period certain, the annuitant's estate or beneficiary is entitled to collect the remaining payments certain.
