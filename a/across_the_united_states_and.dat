5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} sound film would {{drastically}} alter the studio's course: Negotiations {{that began in}} late 1927 with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928. Four months later, {{as part of a}} strategy conceived with RCA head David Sarnoff, Kennedy acquired control of Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>and</b> with the Path√© Exchange and Cecil B.

5|$|Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona {{must start}} life anew. When she is 14years old, Callie {{experiences}} a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> becomes a midwife {{of her new}} life by teaching herself to forget what she has learned as a female. Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed {{and how it is}} administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Newton {{was one of}} the few {{tropical}} cyclones {{that were}} intercepted by Hurricane Hunter flights during the moderately active 1986 Pacific hurricane season. A tropical depression formed near Central America on September18; two days later, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm. Moving towards to northwest, Newton strengthened into a hurricane on September21. After paralleling the coast, Newton move ashore near Cabo San Lucas on September 22. Shortly after entering the Gulf of California, the hurricane attaining its peak intensity of 85mph (145km/h). The following day, Newton moved ashore the Mexican mainland. Newton dissipated on September 23. However, the remnants of Newton continued <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> eventually emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. While 40 homes lost their roofs, damage in Mexico was fairly minor, and no fatalities were reported in association with Newton, though the remnants produced fairly heavy rains in the Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Brown also {{described}} a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 {{and sold to}} their museum. It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Canada. G. libratus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from a virtually complete growth series.|$|E
5|$|Netball {{emerged from}} early {{versions}} of basketball and evolved {{into its own}} sport {{as the number of}} women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets. Naismith's game spread quickly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women. The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor {{conditions}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>and</b> {{the victory}} of anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers. A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies. This group, known as Coxey's Army, agitated {{in favor of a}} national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol, the group scattered. Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.|$|E
5|$|The film made back {{most of its}} {{production}} and promotions budget the day it opened, grossing close to $6,000 in the first hour, and nearly $25,000 during its first week, landing it on Varietys list of the week's 50 top-grossing films. Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in Variety ("There are no more closets!"), The Advocate ("Everyone will {{fall in love with}} this philandering fellator.") and other outlets, which previously had completely ignored the genre. While some critics were less impressed, others saw the film as akin to the avant-garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol.
