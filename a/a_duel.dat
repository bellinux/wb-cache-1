5|$|How {{the matter}} {{escalated}} to <b>a</b> <b>duel</b> {{is also the}} subject of some uncertainty. In his biography of Benjamin Hardin, Lucious P.

Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves.

After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the censure of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.|$|E
