5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
