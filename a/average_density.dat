40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the smoothness problem in cosmology by focussing on the ambiguities originated in the simplifying hypotheses aimed at observationally verifying if the large-scale distribution of galaxies is homogeneous, and conjecturing that this distribution should follow a fractal pattern in perturbed standard cosmologies. This is due to a geometrical effect, appearing when certain types of <b>average</b> <b>densities</b> are calculated along the past light cone. The paper starts reviewing the argument concerning the possibility that the galaxy distribution follows such a scaling pattern, and the premises behind the assumption that the spatial homogeneity of standard cosmology can be observable. Next, it is argued that to discuss observable homogeneity one needs to make a clear distinction between local and <b>average</b> relativistic <b>densities,</b> and showing how the different distance definitions strongly affect them, leading the various <b>average</b> <b>densities</b> to display asymptotically opposite behaviours. Then the paper revisits Ribeiro's (1995 : astro-ph/ 9910145) results, showing that in a fully relativistic treatment some observational <b>average</b> <b>densities</b> of the flat Friedmann model are not well defined at z ~ 0. 1, implying that at this range <b>average</b> <b>densities</b> behave in a fundamentally different manner as compared to the linearity of the Hubble law, well valid for z < 1. This conclusion brings into question the widespread assumption that relativistic corrections can always be neglected at low z. It is also shown how some key features of fractal cosmologies {{can be found in the}} Friedmann models. In view of those findings, it is suggested that the so-called contradiction between the cosmological principle, and the galaxy distribution forming an unlimited fractal structure, may not exist.
