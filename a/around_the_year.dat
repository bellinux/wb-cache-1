5|$|A 2004 {{reference}} work on Western Desert painters suggests Wintjiya {{was born in}} about 1923; the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests 1932; expert Vivien Johnson reports two possible years: 1932 or 1934. The ambiguity <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians have a different conception of time, often estimating dates by comparisons with the occurrence of other events.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance.

5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2000, {{there was}} a wave of {{attempts}} to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type conductivity with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reproduction}} occurs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> {{there is}} a peak during the summer (November to April). Molting mostly occurs during autumn and winter (April to August). At one locality in Mendoza, Akodon spegazzinii occurs at an estimated density of 21 individuals per hectare (8.5 per acre) and has a home range size of about 300 m2 (3200sqft). A number of sigmodontines have been recorded as occurring with A.spegazzinii, including A.caenosus, A.simulator, Neotomys ebriosus, Abrothrix illuteus, Reithrodon auritus, Andinomys edax, and various species of Eligmodontia, Necromys, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, and Phyllotis. The tick Ixodes sigelos has been recorded on A.spegazzinii in Tucumán. In addition, the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Androlaelaps rotundus, and Eulaelaps stabularis and the flea Cleopsylla townsendii are known from the species.|$|E

5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1850, the Kalapuya {{numbered}} between 2,000 and 3,000 {{and were}} distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; {{there may have}} been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both {{the north and the south}} side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.|$|E
5|$|Beginning <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes {{began to grow}} closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and {{the senators}} grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
