5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> this design.|$|E

Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E

The real-time battles were praised for their realism and the new feature of siege battles but also received some criticism for unit management.

The game was a commercial success, topping the British video game chart upon release.|$|E
5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E

Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity.

Ellie's role in Left Behinds plot has prompted some social commentary within the industry, with coverage focusing on a scene depicting LGBT themes.

5|$|The {{sheer size}} <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> the {{planetary}} ecosystem has proved problematic {{for the design}} of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, more tangible closed systems. For example, he likens human existence on Earth— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the diversity <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) {{because of}} its {{randomly}} generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation {{of the world and}} its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural look. He further explained that he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of carps eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough, was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> the path, can cause a heavy load on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and Third World refugees helped prepare the UNHCR {{for a change in}} the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E

Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points.
