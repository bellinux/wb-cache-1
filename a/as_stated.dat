5|$|<b>As</b> <b>stated</b> above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
