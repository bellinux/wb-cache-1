The Note will examine the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of Section 1581 (a) under which the search arose, analyze the judicial treatment of the decisions relied on by the Court and criticize the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the 2 ̆ 2 reasonableness 2 ̆ 2 of the governmental intrusion. The Note concludes that because private cabin-boaters have great interests against <b>arbitrary</b> <b>intrusion</b> by officials, cases such as Villamonte-Marquez should be scrutinized more carefully to preserve the protection of the fourth amendment...|$|E
40|$|May 31, 1999 China's {{economic}} {{performance of the}} past two decades presents a puzzle for the economics of transition and development: Enormous private business incentives were unleashed that have fueled rapid economic growth despite the fact that China has had very weak "conventional institutions" (such as the rule of law and separation of powers) to constrain the government from <b>arbitrary</b> <b>intrusion</b> into economic activities. We argue that one mechanism that has limited the government's ability for predation and harassment is commitment through information decentralization, where the key institution is "anonymous banking," that is, a combination of the use of cash for transactions and the use of anonymous savings deposits. Meanwhile, the government has benefitted from the improved private incentives by collecting quasi-fiscal revenues from the state banking system through "financial repression," a combination of controls on international capital flows with restrictions on domestic interest rates. We show that the major features of China's economy concerning its fiscal decline, financial deepening, and the sectoral dual-track can be better understood using this analytical framework. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{paradigm}} for robust ASR based on auditory scene analysis. In previous work, we have shown how models of auditory processing and grouping principles {{can be used to}} separate the evidence for a speech signal from <b>arbitrary</b> <b>intrusions.</b> However, this evidence will generally be incomplete since some spectrotemporal regions will be dominated by the other sources. Here, we address the problem of recognising such `occluded' speech. Two investigations are reported: the first applies unsupervised learning and subsequent recognition to spectral vectors with missing components. The second adapts the Viterbi algorithm for HMM-based ASR to the occluded speech case. Both techniques are encouragingly robust: for instance, {{more than half of the}} observation vector can be obscured without appreciable deterioration in recognition performance. Additionally, our demonstration that it is possible to learn to recognise speech from partial information suggests a model for the for [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The post-Edward Snowden {{debate over}} {{government}} surveillance has been vigorous. One aspect of that {{debate has been}} widespread criticism of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), alleging that the FISC served as a rubber stamp for the government, consistently accepting implausible interpretations of existing law that served to expand government surveillance authority; engaging in tortured analyses of statutory language; and ignoring fundamental Fourth Amendment principles. This Article argues that these critiques have entirely overlooked critical aspects of the FISC’s jurisprudence. A close look at that jurisprudence reveals a court that did, in fact, vigorously defend the interests customarily protected by the Fourth Amendment—individual privacy and freedom from <b>arbitrary</b> government <b>intrusions</b> into the personal sphere. Faced with government surveillance requests that posed significant privacy concerns, but for which the government was unlikely to accept “no” as an answer, the FISC resourcefully employed a familiar tool—minimization procedures (rules designed to augment privacy protections {{in the context of}} electronic surveillance) —to champion constitutional principles and preserve for itself a role in surveillance oversight while simultaneously avoiding a no-win confrontation with the executive. This creative solution took the form of a bargain: the FISC permitted the government to implement its surveillance programs, but only after embedding in those programs a set of rules protecting what I have labeled “quasi-constitutional rights. ...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) It is only {{in recent}} decades that marine {{scientific}} research has begun to reveal the true physical characteristics and resource potential of the open ocean and deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction. A combination of {{factors such as the}} depletion of inshore fish stocks and an increase in global maritime trade has led to greater usage of the vast maritime area beyond the territorial sea and exclusive economic zone limits of the coastal states. Human activities in this area of the ocean, which covers approximately 50 % of the world’s surface, have expanded to include bioprospecting, exploration for deep seabed minerals, more sophisticated marine scientific research and deep sea tourism. This rise in human activities beyond the offshore zones of coastal states poses actual and potential threats to the physical characteristics and biodiversity of the open ocean and deep sea environments. <b>Arbitrary</b> human <b>intrusions</b> into this largely unexplored marine domain have the potential to harm the intricate links between complex marine ecosystems and to erode components of marine biodiversity. This thesis examines the global and regional provisions which have been put in place to regulate the environmental impacts of human activities that occur beyond national jurisdiction. An analysis of these instruments and their implementation reveals that the current international law framework provides only minimal levels of protection for the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction. It explores several options based on the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to establish a cohesive environmental protection system for the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a large-scale cyber network with N components (e. g., paths, servers, subnets). Each component is {{either in a}} healthy state (0) or an abnormal state (1). Due to random intrusions, the state of each component transits from 0 to 1 over time according to certain stochastic process. At each time, a subset of K (K < N) components are checked and those observed in abnormal states are fixed. The objective is to design the optimal scheduling for intrusion detection such that the long-term network cost incurred by all abnormal components is minimized. We formulate the problem as a special class of Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) process. A general RMAB suffers from the curse of dimensionality (PSPACE-hard) and numerical methods are often inapplicable. We show that, for this class of RMAB, Whittle index exists and can be obtained in closed form, leading to a low-complexity implementation of Whittle index policy with a strong performance. For homogeneous components, Whittle index policy is shown to have a simple structure that does not require any prior knowledge on the intrusion processes. Based on this structure, Whittle index policy is further shown to be optimal over a finite time horizon with an <b>arbitrary</b> length. Beyond <b>intrusion</b> detection, these results also find applications in queuing networks with finite-size buffers. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The use of GPS {{surveillance}} {{technology for}} prolonged automated surveillance of American citizens is proliferating, and a direct {{split between the}} Ninth and D. C. Circuits on whether warrants are required under the Fourth Amendment for such use of GPS technology is bringing the issue to a head in the Supreme Court. A Petition for Certiorari is pending in the Ninth Circuit case which held that warrants are not required, and a second Petition is likely from the Government in the D. C. Circuit case holding that warrants are required. In this paper, we argue first, that where a technology enables invasion of interests {{at the heart of}} the Fourth Amendment’s concern [...] protection of citizens from <b>arbitrary</b> government <b>intrusions</b> into their private lives [...] the Court’s precedents require warrants to prevent abuse, and second, that the type and scope of information collected by prolonged automated GPS surveillance enables governments to monitor a person’s political associations, their medical conditions and their amorous interests, in a way that invades their privacy and chills expression of other fundamental rights. Our argument differs significantly from previous scholarship by tracing a continuous emphasis in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on review of the potential for abuse of surveillance methods. Moreover, we are the first to argue that in protecting against abuse the Court has drawn a firm line between technology that simply enhances the natural senses of law enforcement officials, and technology that creates novel, non-biological “senses. ” In Part I of this paper, we trace the origins of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against law enforcement abuse, present evidence that GPS surveillance technology is in fact being abused, and discuss the impact unfettered abuse of the technology will have on the individual rights of citizens. In Part II, we explain the Court’s historic approach to new surveillance technologies, noting that the Court has carefully examined new technologies to prevent any end-runs around legal doctrine from eroding personal privacy, and showing that the Court has always required warrants where technology goes beyond enhancement of senses to the creation of new non-biological “senses. ” In Part III, we explain why the Supreme Court’s ruling on the use of beeper technology to enhance visual surveillance in United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276 (1983), does not apply to the use of GPS technology as a replacement for visual surveillance. Finally, in Part IV, we explain how prolonged automated GPS surveillance invades a reasonable expectation of privacy and chills the exercise of core constitutional rights...|$|R
