40|$|Background Most {{methods of}} {{assessing}} colonic motility are poorly acceptable to patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can monitor gastrointestinal motility and fluid distributions. We predicted that {{a dose of}} oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) and electrolyte solution would increase ileo-colonic inflow and stimulate colonic motility. We aimed to investigate the colonic response to distension by oral PEG electrolyte in healthy volunteers (HVs) and to evaluate the effect of single 2 L vs split (2 × 1 L) dosing. Methods Twelve HVs received a split dose (1 L the evening before and 1 L on the study day) and another 12 HVs a single dose (2 L on the main study day) of PEG electrolyte. They underwent MRI scans, completed symptom questionnaires, and provided stool samples. Outcomes included small bowel water content, <b>ascending</b> colon motility <b>index,</b> and regional colonic volumes. Key Results Small bowel water content increased fourfold from baseline after ingesting both split (p = 0. 0010) and single dose (p = 0. 0005). The total colonic volume increase from baseline was smaller for the split dose at 35 ± 8 % than for the single dose at 102 ± 27 %, p = 0. 0332. The <b>ascending</b> colon motility <b>index</b> after treatment was twofold higher for the single dose group (p = 0. 0103). Conclusions & Inferences Ingestion of 1 and 2 L PEG electrolyte solution caused a rapid increase in the small bowel and colonic volumes and a robust rise in colonic motility. The increase in both volumes and motility was dose dependent. Such a challenge, being well-tolerated, could be a useful way of assessing colonic motility in future studies...|$|R

Methods　Five obese Beagle dog models of T 2 DM underwent endoscopic esophagus-jejunum covered stent bypass to serve as operation group, and five normal Beagle dogs as control group receive endoscopy and exploratory laparotomy. The T 2 DM indices of both groups, including fast plasma glucose (FPG) level, fast insulin (FINS) level, intravenous glucose tolerance test- 2 h plasma glucose (IVGTT- 2 h PG) and IVGTT- 2 h FINS, were determined regularly before operation and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after operation. The insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and the function of islet β-cell (HOMA-β) were calculated with Homeostasis Model Assessment. The levels of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) were also determined.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about fully {{normalizing}} abstract λ-calculus machines. They employ {{the equivalent of}} full-fledged β-reductions to resolve potential naming conflicts when substituting and reducing under abstractionss. Both functions and variables may thus freely be passed along as function parameters and returned as function values, which {{is the key to}} performing symbolic computations involving free variables as, for instance, in term rewrite or proof systems. This contrasts with conventional functional languages whose semantics are based on a weakly normalizing λ-calculus that is confined to computing closed terms only. The two machines described in this paper are descendants of an secd-machine that supports a nameless λ-calculus which has bound variable occurrences replaced by deBruijn indices. Full normalization is achieved by a few more state transition rules that η-extend unapplied abstractions to full applications, inserting in <b>ascending</b> order deBruijn <b>indices</b> for missing arguments. Updating these indices in the course of doing (the equivalent of) β-reductions is accomplished by means of a simple counting mechanism that inflicts very little overhead. Both machines realize a head-order strategy that emphasizes normalization along the leftmost spine of a λ-expression. The simpler fn secd-machine abides by the concept of saving (and unsaving) on a dump structure machine contexts upon each individual β-reduction. The more sophisticated fn se(m) cd-machine performs what are called β-reductions-in-the-large that normalize entire spines in the same contexts.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the relationship of female sex, aortic pathology, and left ventricular function to outcome after an operation for aortic regurgitation. Methods: One hundred nine women underwent aortic valve replacement (n = 92) or repair (n = 17) for pure aortic regurgitation between 1985 and 1996. Mean follow-up was 5. 7 ± 2. 6 years. New York Heart Association functional class III-IV symptoms were present in 70 patients, whereas left ventricular function was normal in 60 patients. Ascending aortic diameter in 97 % exceeded the 90 th percentile for a size-matched healthy population. A concomitant aortic operation was performed by means of root replacement in 31 patients and by means of interposition graft in 28 patients. Of 50 patients undergoing isolated valve procedures, 19 had aortas of 4. 0 cm or larger. Results: At 5 and 10 years, survival was 78 % and 44 %, respectively. Fatal aortic rupture occurred in 13 patients, and 2 others underwent emergency operations for impending aortic rupture, {{for a total of}} 15 late aortic events. Freedom from aortic events was 87 % and 76 % at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Risk factors for aortic events were older age (P =. 07) and increasing <b>ascending</b> aortic diameter <b>indexed</b> to body surface area (P =. 03) in women who had not undergone replacement of the ascending aorta. Rupture location was at the ascending aorta in 71 % without ascending replacement and the descending aorta in 62 % with ascending grafts. Conclusion: In women, late survival after an operation for aortic regurgitation is importantly decreased by coexisting aortic pathology with subsequent aortic rupture. Aortic replacement at the time of a valve operation should be considered on the basis of indexed aortic size. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 119 : 1205 - 15...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim : Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{increases}} the risk of aortic valve dysfunction and ascending aorta aneurysm and, consequently, the need for aortic valve replacement and/or aortic repair. However, there is no universal consensus about the surgical criteria and the predictors for surgery. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate related factors to the need for surgery in the setting of a strict long-term follow-up with relatively conservative surgical criteria. Methods : We prospectively followed 120 patients after the diagnosis of BAV. Predisposing factors for a future need for aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta repair were assessed. Aortic surgery was indicated when the ascending aorta diameter was &# 8805; 55 mm and was recommended based on patient characteristics and in the presence of a severe aortic valve dysfunction with an aortic diameter &# 8805; 50 mm. Results : During follow-up (mean, 86 months), 34 patients (28 %) (mean age, 56 &# 177; 12 years) were surgically treated. Aortic valve dysfunction (n= 22; 64 %) and ascending aorta dilatation (n= 12; 36 %) were the indications for surgery. Aortic regurgitation was the most frequent valve dysfunction at the time of diagnosis for BAV, but aortic stenosis was the most frequent indication for surgery. The presence at surgery of either aortic regurgitation or stenosis was clearly related to age, with regurgitation predominating in patients under 55 years, and aortic stenosis in older patients. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that aortic stenosis (hazard ratio 4. 1, p= 0. 001), <b>indexed</b> <b>ascending</b> aorta dilatation (hazard ratio 3. 0, p= 0. 03) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter &# 8805; 60 mm (hazard ratio= 4. 0, p= 0. 01) at diagnosis were factors associated with future surgery. Aortic dissection was not observed in patients that did not undergo surgery. Conclusions : A relatively conservative approach for the indication of ascending aortic surgery in BAV is safe. In this setting, the presence of aortic or left ventricle dilatation and aortic stenosis at diagnosis of BAV were predictive of the need for surgery in the follow-up. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Science {{production}} {{is one of}} the main dimensions of sustainable development in any country. Thus, universities as the major centers for science production play a key role in development. The present study aimed to assess the trend of science production in Iran’s type I universities of medical sciences from 2007 to 2012. Method: In this study, the universities’ scores of empowering, governance and leadership, science production, student researches, and number of published articles were computed based on the evaluations of universities of medical sciences by the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education from 2007 to 2012. Then, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the figures were drawn by Excel software. Results: This study assessed science production in Iran’s type I universities of medical sciences and analyzed each university’s proportion in publication of articles. According to the results, most of the published articles were affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. However, considering the role of number of faculty members, different results were obtained. With respect to the evaluation raw scores, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences showed a considerable reduction of scores in 2012, while other universities had a constant or <b>ascending</b> trend. Besides, <b>indexed</b> articles followed an ascending trend in all the universities and most of the articles had been published in index 1. Conclusion: Similar to other studies, the findings of this study revealed an increase in science productions in Iran through the recent years. Yet, the highest scores of the studied indexes, except for student researches, were related to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. This great difference between this university and other universities might be due to accumulation of specific potentials and forces in this region. Overall, science productions followed an ascending trend in all type I universities of medical sciences. Yet, more attempts should be made to publish high-quality articles in reliable international journals. Thus, managers and policymakers are recommended to provide the ground for improvement and empowerment of knowledge and science production, development of leadership and governance capacity, empowerment of researchers, and provision of financial and infrastructure supports for development of fundamental, basic, clinical, and applied researches which can be presented at the international level...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar o nível de evidência científica e epidemiológica da hipótese de associação entre peso ao nascer e sobrepeso/obesidade na infância e na adolescência, a partir de revisão sistemática da literatura. MÉTODO: Foi realizada revisão sistemática nas bases MedLine/Pubmed, Scielo-Brasil e Lilacs. Adaptou-se a escala de Downs & Black para avaliar a qualidade metodológica dos catorze artigos selecionados. Os artigos foram classificados em duas categorias de análise, de acordo com o índice de desenvolvimento humano do país onde o estudo foi realizado: a) peso ao nascer e sobrepeso/obesidade em países com desenvolvimento humano elevado; e b) peso ao nascer e sobrepeso/obesidade em países com desenvolvimento humano elevado, mas ainda ascendente, e com desenvolvimento humano médio. RESULTADOS: Em ambas as categorias predominou a associação entre elevado peso ao nascer e sobrepeso/obesidade. Além disso, na primeira categoria, um dos sete artigos mostrou que o baixo peso ao nascer foi preditor de maior percentual de gordura {{corporal}} e abdominal. Na segunda categoria, três artigos mostraram associação do catch-up growth com sobrepeso/obesidade, e um mostrou o baixo peso ao nascer como fator protetor do sobrepeso (incluindo obesidade). Foram capturados quatro artigos brasileiros, dentre os quais dois não identificaram associação estatisticamente significativa entre peso ao nascer e sobrepeso/obesidade. CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS: O elevado peso ao nascer apareceu associado ao sobrepeso/obesidade na maioria dos artigos. Há necessidade de se continuar investigando sobre a associação entre o baixo peso ao nascer e sobrepeso/obesidade.

40|$|Congenital {{increase}} in cardiac outflow tract resistance {{would lead to}} chronic ventricular pressure overloading, and eventually ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. Conventional echocardiographic assessment of global ventricular systolic and diastolic function is far from ideal {{because of the lack}} of sensitivity. There is a pressing need in developing a clinical tool to unveil the degree of myocardial dysfunction as well as to monitor the treatment effect in these patients. M-mode and tissue Doppler recordings of the left and right atrioventricular rings' motion in a longitudinal cardiac axis allowed us to assess segmental ventricular function in a more sensitive and specific way. This thesis aimed to assess ventricular long axis function in patients with congenital outflow tract obstructions. It is based on the anatomical observation that a major part of long axis function is subtended by subendocardial fibers, and the hypothesis that the function of these fibers might be more sensitive to effect of pressure overload than circumferential ones. Normal values for left and right ventricular (RV) long axis function (in left, septal and tricuspid sites of atrioventricular rings) were first established by studying normal healthy volunteers without cardiovascular diseases with M-mode and pulse wave (PW) tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI). These values included: 1) M-mode derived systolic amplitude of motion (displacement) 2) Any long axis incoordination (long axis shortening after end of ejection which was reported as a sign of coronary ischemia after excluding interventricular conduction abnormalities) 3) TDI-derived peak systolic and diastolic velocities. The following groups of patients with congenital outflow tract obstructions were therefore studied: 1) Congenital aortic valve stenosis and subaortic stenosis (21 patients, study 1). 2) Congenital coarctation of aorta (23 patients, study 2). 3) Congenital pulmonary valve stenosis (43 patients, study 3). Study 1 investigated the presence of "isolated" diastolic disease, defined as reduced long axis early diastolic velocity with normal systolic velocity in 21 young patients with congenital aortic valve stenosis (AVS). Most patients with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions in fact had depressed long axis systolic velocities. This work demonstrated the selective sensitivity of long axis function in unveiling myocardial dysfunction in AVS patients. Moreover, good correlation was found between long axis systolic and diastolic velocities which suggested isolated diastolic disease is unlikely. Patients with coarctation of aorta (CoA) are often less symptomatic (fewer reported chest pain or heart failure) that AVS patients despite having similar degree of outflow resistance. Study 2 addressed such phenomenon by studying the long axis function in 23 CoA patients and the results were compared to 23 AVS patients and normal controls. This work again confirmed the presence of LV long axis impairment in patients with chronic {{increase in}} LV afterload. Moreover, a worse deterioration of LV long axis function and a higher prevalence of long axis incoordination independent of LV outflow resistance is seen in patients with proximally increased LV afterload (AVS) compared with distal disease (CoA) that might account for their difference in clinical behavior. Data are scant to address the impact of chronic increase in RV outflow resistance on RV diastolic performance. Study 3 evaluated the relationship of restrictive RV physiology (defined as the presence of antegrade pulmonary arterial flow in late diastole measured by conventional PW Doppler echocardiography) to RV long axis function and patients' symptoms in 43 patients with pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS). Restrictive RV physiology was found in 42 % studied patients who were more symptomatic and had more severe RV long axis dysfunction. This work implied regular follow-up of adult PVS patients using simple qualitative RV Doppler echocardiographic measurements should guide toward early identification of myocardial dysfunction and the need for removal of outflow tract obstruction before irreversible damage occurs. Given the selective sensitivity of long axis function in assessing myocardial damage In patients with pressure overloaded ventricle, I further studied the effect of interventions on change of long axis behavior in patients with CoA: 1) Before and 14 month after successful endovascular stenting (21 patients, study 4). 2) Long term follow up after surgical correction, by either angioplasty or endovascular stenting (80 patients, study 5). Study 4 prospectively evaluated the effect of endovascular stenting on intermediate-term biventricular function in 21 adults with CoA and the results were compared with surgically repaired patients and normal controls. LV long axis disturbances were improved with sparing of RV long axis function after intervention. Subclinical myocardial dysfunction was observed in both stented and repaired patients compared with normal controls. This work supported aortic stenting in patients with anatomically suitable lesions. It also prompted further studies on the clinical significance of persistent myocardial dysfunction in "corrected" CoA patients. In study 5, I went on to examine the prevalence of LV long axis diastole dysfunction (defined as septal PW TDI early diastolic velocity 8 cm/s) in a relatively large cohort of CoA patients (n= 80) and its relationships to patient demo graphics and aortic elastic properties. Forty-seven patients (59 %) were found to have LV long axis dysfunction. As a group, they were older when received treatment and had higher <b>ascending</b> aortic stiffness <b>indices</b> despite similar systemic blood pressure, prevalence of anti-hypertensive use and associated bicuspid aortic valve as compared to other CoA patients. This work addressed the age at intervention and increased aortic stiffness are important determinants of persistent myocardial dysfunction after intervention. Intervention at an early age before structural damage to proximal aorta and appropriate medications to reduce central aortic stiffness might preserve LV long axis function in "corrected" CoA patients and further improve their long term prognosis. CONCLUSIONS:In conclusion, conventional global echocardiographic assessment is inadequate for assessing patients with congenital outflow tract obstructions. Segmental ventricular long axis function is frequently abnormal at rest in these patients. The site of these disturbances corresponds to the ventricle that is subjected to pressure overloading. Assessment of long axis function is simple and sensitive. It has considerable potential in investigating the natural course of myocardial damage, to clarify the basis of abnormal ventricular function, particularly during diastole and to evaluate treatment effect on myocardial recovery in patients with congenital outflow tract obstructions. Further studies should focus on the role of long axis function in determining prognosis for these patients. Lam, Yat Yin. "November 2011. "Thesis (M. D.) [...] Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2012.
