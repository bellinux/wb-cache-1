5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> number of rows or columns (or both) is called <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> matrix. In some contexts, such as {{computer}} algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} {{temporal}} finitism {{was inspired by}} the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> past and future. Philoponus' arguments against <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> past were used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).|$|E

5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> regress.|$|E

5|$|The Greek philosopher Zeno {{considered}} {{the problem of}} summing <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility: the result was Zeno's paradox.

5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> line, the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E

5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> number of {{possible}} values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm.
