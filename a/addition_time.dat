2500|$|Act one is {{an amalgam}} of early 20th century New Jersey and {{the dawn of the}} Ice Age. The father is inventing things such as the lever, the wheel, the alphabet, and {{multiplication}} tables. [...] The family (the Antrobuses) and the entire north-eastern U.S. face extinction by a wall of ice moving southward from Canada. [...] The story is introduced by a narrator and further expanded by the family maid, Sabina. [...] There are unsettling parallels between the members of the Antrobus family and various characters from the Bible. [...] In <b>addition,</b> <b>time</b> is compressed and scrambled {{to such an extent that}} the refugees who arrive at the Antrobus house seeking food and fire include the Old Testament judge Moses, the ancient Greek poet Homer, and women who are identified as Muses.|$|E

40|$|Metering liquid {{reagents}} into reaction mixtures in {{a controlled}} and reproducible manner has often been a problem in synthetic chemistry. Carrying out the real simultaneous addition {{of two or more}} liquid reagents (concurrent additions) is even more inconvenient. Difficulties increase when addition volumes become small, when <b>addition</b> <b>times</b> become long, or when the reagents are corrosive or air-sensitive. We have constructed and tested an inexpensive, automated device for the slow, precise delivery of liquid reagents into laboratory-scale reaction mixtures. Controlled by a standard personal computer, this slow adder can accommodate liquid volumes from hundreds of microlitres to litres and <b>addition</b> <b>times</b> from minutes to days. Its glass and Teflon construction makes it useful for nearly all reagents. By using multiple slow adders, true concurrent addition of several liquids can be easily achieved...|$|R
