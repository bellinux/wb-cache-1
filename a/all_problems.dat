The local {{government}} reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at €100million, were totally destroyed. Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> would be resolved within three months, it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity. Other than the crop damage, the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage, {{both of which were}} quickly repaired.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above <b>all,</b> <b>problems</b> with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

Three different methods of solutions based on different initial solution techniques and the current method used by the port were used to test forty sample problems which were classified into four problem types representing different patterns of container arrivals. The results of this study revealed that the three methods based on the ACO could be used to improve the total time taken for stacking and storage of the export containers for <b>all</b> <b>problem</b> types. Among the methods investigated, the heuristic-based ant colony optimization (BACO) method proved to be the most efficient for <b>all</b> <b>problem</b> types, with the relative improvements over the current method ranging from 25. 4 - 38. 7 %. 1...|$|R

25|$|The proof {{shows that}} any problem in NP {{can be reduced}} in {{polynomial}} time (in fact, logarithmic space suffices) to an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem. This means that if the Boolean satisfiability problem could be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, then <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> in NP could be solved in polynomial time, and so the complexity class NP would be equal to the complexity class P.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Worked {{examples}} {{have repeatedly}} demonstrated learning benefits {{in a range}} of studies, particularly with low prior knowledge students and when the examples are presented in alternating fashion with problems to solve. Recently, worked examples alternating with intelligently-tutored problems have been shown to provide at least as much learning benefit to students as <b>all</b> tutored <b>problems,</b> with the advantage of taking significantly less learning time (i. e., more efficiency) than <b>all</b> tutored <b>problems.</b> Given prior findings, together with the prevailing belief that students should be prompted to actively solve problems after studying examples, rarely have all worked examples been tried as a learning intervention. To test the conventional wisdom, as well as to explore an understudied approach, a study was conducted with 145 high school students in the domain of chemistry to compare alternating worked examples / tutored <b>problems,</b> <b>all</b> tutored <b>problems,</b> and <b>all</b> worked examples. It was hypothesized that the alternating condition would lead to better results (i. e., better learning and/or learning efficiency) than either all examples or <b>all</b> tutored <b>problems.</b> However, the hypothesis was not confirmed: While all three conditions learned roughly the same amount, the all worked examples condition took significantly less time and was a more efficient learning treatment than either alternating examples/tutored <b>problems</b> or <b>all</b> tutored <b>problems.</b> This paper posits an explanation for why this (seemingly) surprising result was found...|$|R

25|$|When 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} {{problems}} generally regarded as minor. Consequences did not always result exactly at midnight. Some programs were not active at that moment and problems would only show up when they were invoked. Not <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> recorded were directly linked to Y2K programming in a causality; minor technological glitches occur on a regular basis. Some caused erroneous results, some caused machines to stop working, some caused date errors, and two caused malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|These {{barriers}} {{have also}} led some computer scientists {{to suggest that}} the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct. However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP. Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> in NP.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the ethnic}} Macedonian {{majority}} {{and the largest}} minority, the ethnic Albanians, have co-existed uneasily {{both before and after}} the country declared independence in 1991, their relations have generally been peaceful. All of the successive Macedonian governments have included Albanian parties as coalition partners, and <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> were resolved through political dialogue. The mood was more or less optimistic until the beginning of 2001. The main cause for incidents though, was the repression by the Macedonian governments on the use of the Albanian language in Macedonia and the ban of the use of the Albanian flag. In 1997 the Constitutional Court forbade the use of Albanian flag, sparking protests.|$|E
25|$|That is, if {{we assume}} that NP, the class of nondeterministic {{polynomial}} time problems, can be contained in the non-uniform polynomial time complexity class P/poly, then this assumption implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy at its second level. Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other NP-complete problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that P ≠ NP. As P/poly contains <b>all</b> <b>problems</b> solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman's theorem), the Karp–Lipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems.|$|E

In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, A paper from this thesis was published in 1938. In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits {{could be used to}} simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used then in telephone call routing switches.
