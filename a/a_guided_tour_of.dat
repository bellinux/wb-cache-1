5|$|In 1954, {{the tour}} company R.K. Swan invited Wheeler to provide lectures on the {{archaeology}} of ancient Greece aboard their Hellenic cruise line, {{which he did}} in 1955. In 1957, he then gave <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> the archaeology of the Indian subcontinent for the rival tour company Fairways and Swinford. After Swans appointed him {{to the position of}} chairman of their Hellenic Cruise division, he made two fortnight tours a year, in spring and summer. In late 1969 he conducted the Swans tour to the Indian subcontinent, visiting the south and east of the republic as well as Ceylon. During this period, Wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in India and Pakistan, helping to secure them work and funding where possible.|$|E

25|$|Soviet {{aviation}} {{was heavily}} {{supported by a}} large industry. Hitler had forbidden air reconnaissance flights deep into the Soviet Union until shortly {{before the beginning of}} Barbarossa, and the Luftwaffe did not possess the aircraft with the range to be able to reach the Ural factories to see how vast Soviet industry was. Shortly before the invasion, German engineers were given <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> Soviet industrial complexes and aircraft factories in the Urals from the 7 to the 16 April, and evidence of extensive production was already underway. Their reports to the OKW went unheeded.|$|E
25|$|Walter Reuther {{and other}} {{presidents of the}} UAW had been active {{in a number of}} social issues, and Bieber {{continued}} that tradition. In 1983, {{he was a member of}} a controversial effort to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Bieber joined the National Labor Committee, a group which opposed U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. The group successfully overcame vocal opposition from staunch anti-communists on the AFL-CIO executive council to win approval of a resolution that put the labor federation in favor of a negotiated settlement and criticized the Reagan administration of seeking only a military solution. In January 1986, he won AFL-CIO approval of a boycott of U.S. companies doing business in South Africa under apartheid. Later that year, he traveled to South Africa, where he met with several cabinet ministers and angrily demanded that the government release anti-apartheid labor leaders who had been jailed but never charged with any crimes. He also successfully put pressure on GM to pay these workers until they had been convicted. In 1990, shortly after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela traveled to the United States and thanked Bieber for his support; Bieber gave him <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> the Ford River Rouge Complex.|$|E
25|$|Women Against Pornography's best-known tactic was <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> the {{pornography}} and prostitution outlets in Times Square, which they led {{twice a week}} for a suggested contribution of $5.00. (In San Francisco, WAVPM had conducted similar tours in the red-light districts of that city.) Lynn Campbell suggested that people who did not consume pornography knew very little about the content of the pornography or the atmosphere in sex shops and live sex shows, and that actual guided tours of the sex industry in Times Square would provide an excellent educational tool. Susan Brownmiller planned an itinerary for the tour and wrote a script for the guides (with the help of information supplied by Carl Weisbrod, a police officer tasked with finding and closing down underground brothels in Midtown, and Maggie Smith, the owner of a neighborhood bar). The tours often involved unplanned encounters—being physically thrown out by enraged store managers, watching businessmen try to hide from the tourists, or talking briefly with nude performers while they took their breaks. After a reporter for The New York Times took one of the first tours and wrote a feature article for the Style section, WAP received coverage in People, Time, The Philadelphia Inquirer, European newspapers, local TV news programs and talk shows in New York City, and The Phil Donahue Show in Chicago.|$|E
