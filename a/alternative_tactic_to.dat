40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} greater understanding of immigration attitudes through four essays focused on an important migration hub, Latin America. Each essay either develops existing scholarship by providing highly specified empirical tests of important theoretical debates or utilizes an alternative framework to approach the analysis of immigration attitudes. The first essay (Chapter 2) addresses a long standing theoretical and empirical debate concerning the role of economic self-interest and education in shaping immigration attitudes. I demonstrate that concern over labor competition is not an important factor influencing immigration attitudes in Latin America and that education increases tolerance of foreigners. Chapter 3 utilizes a unique survey experiment conducted in Chile to demonstrate that individual attitudes are a function of sociotropic economic concerns. Additionally, there is evidence that individuals perceive immigration as having important humanitarian implications. Chapter 4 takes an <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic</b> <b>to</b> advancing the scholarly understanding of immigration attitudes by examining how a religious institution can theoretically shape immigration attitudes. In Chapter 5, I formulate an alternative framework to analyze immigration attitudes. I argue that individuals experience migration as a dual phenomenon—one marked by emigration and immigration—and thus their immigration attitudes are influenced by this dual lens. Importantly, I show that both familial and financial connections to emigrants are determinants of immigration attitudes. Overall, the dissertation enhances our understanding of immigration attitudes by leveraging the economic and cultural characteristics of Latin America to test highly debated theory and by developing alternative analytical approaches...|$|E

In Uca urvillei, both burrow and surface mating males were larger than the average sized male in the population. Standardised directional selection gradients indicated that selection on male size was stronger in U. urvillei than U. annulipes, reflecting the differences between species in male mating success.

Species of Brycon are amongst the most threatened in the Neotropics, particularly in southeast Brazil, due to anthropogenic activities in this region. This study investigated the feeding and social behaviors of the endangered fish, Brycon devillei in the Preto River, Jequitinhonha basin, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Behavioral data were collected by snorkeling with four spatially separated groups (habituated), and direct observations of shoals were made using an underwater video camera (a total of 448 hours of observations).

However, the species proved to be predominately a specialist surface-picker, which adopted <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> find food at certain times of the year, most notably when food items on the water surface became low. Feeding frequency was shown to be negatively correlated to agonistic behavior between conspecifics. Feeding associations were also recorded between the anostomid Leporinus garmani, acting as a nuclear species, and B. devillei, as follower species.

Patrollers have a smaller body size than territorial males. There is significant competition over the possession of territories. Although these territories do not necessarily hold any resources or nesting sites, owning a territory tends to lead to a greater number of mating opportunities. Males attract females to these territories by rubbing their abdomens across the territories to apply pheromones. Because of their inability to successfully compete against the larger territorial males for territories, smaller males resort to patrolling. But patrollers do not just wait around for territories to be vacated; they will sneak matings with females in territories when the territorial males are temporarily away or distracted.|$|R

Intertextual connections with other Catalan and European writers (mostly French, MonsÃ³â€™s second language) are also thoroughly examined. The title of the book indicates the two main characteristics that define MonsÃ³â€™s writing: a subtle but implacable ironic discourse with social and cultural undertones, and an inclusive representation of difference that questions the despotic duality of the hierarchical binaries which engender the figure of the Other. Imma MonsÃ³â€™s fiction transforms female otherness into a space of resistance to hegemonic discourses and proposes new configurations of female subjectivity which reject the traditional victim mentality. Her topics include the feminist re-writing of canonical literary topics (such as female adultery, with a twist {{in the construction of the}} narrative voice), the mother-daughter relationship (representing, against tradition, the mother figure as a historical subject), the conflicts between remembering and forgetting (following Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s radical anti-Oedipal viewpoint) or the textualisation of female cancer (with a pro-Sontag angle that fights against the cultural taboos around the illness).

We tested the effect of different flight activity levels and of the behavioural tactics on lipid reserves and lipid use in males by laboratory and outdoor cage experiments. Low-activity males that had access to honey water were capable of synthesizing lipids; their lipid reserves increased with age. The effect disappeared in males that actively flew in the outdoor cages.

During 2 of the study years, OSRs were highly male-biased {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season and then gradually decreased when male numbers increased. Males with a low body condition index (CI) tend to arrive later and to lose relatively more mass than males with a higher CI. There was a negative relationship between percent mass loss per day and CI as well as length of stay in the breeding area, which suggests that a high energetic cost tactic was adopted by males with a higher CI.

Male dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus can be separated into two morphs: major males have horns and guard females whereas minor males are hornless and sneak copulations.

40|$|Autotomy, the {{voluntary}} shedding of limbs or other body {{parts in the}} face of predation, is a highly effective escape mechanism that has evolved independently in a variety of taxa. Crabs are unusual in that the limb that is typically sacrificed during autotomy, the anterior clawed cheliped, {{can also be used to}} ward off attack. During an encounter with a predator, an individual must thus decide between two mutually exclusive strategies: flight or fight. We used experimental predation encounters with two species of porcelain crabs (genus Petrolisthes) to examine the factors that influence the decision to flee versus fight and to determine the degree to which this decision is context-dependent. We found that autotomy was highly conditional.

40|$|Among {{vertebrate}} classes, fishes exhibit by far {{the greatest}} variability in competitive and cooperative behaviors in male reproduction. Scramble competition between reproductive males is one possibility. Another possibility occurs when resources, mates, or locations can be monopolized, in which case males may invest in primary access to fertilizations by adopting a "bourgeois” strategy, or they may employ <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> evade the reproductive monopoly of other males. Adaptations in morphology, physiology, and behavior to bourgeois and alternative phenotypes are highly divergent.

Examples will illustrate the importance of ecology, and will suggest that variation in reproductive tactics is largely adaptive. Behavioral solutions to competition for mates and fertilizations often involve agonistic behavior and conflict, but also cooperation among competitors (e. g., when subordinate males pay a price to bourgeois males for gaining access to fertilizable eggs).

40|$|Group living {{can provide}} {{individuals}} with several benefits, including cooperative vigilance and lower predation rates. Individuals in larger groups {{may be less}} vulnerable to predation due to dilution effects, efficient detection or greater ability to repel predators. Individuals in smaller groups may consequently employ <b>alternative</b> behavioural <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> compensate for their greater vulnerability to predators. Here, we describe how pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor) fledging age varies with group size and the associated risk of nestling predation. Nestling predation is highest in smaller groups, {{but there is no}} effect of group size on fledgling predation. Consequently, small groups fledge young earlier, thereby reducing the risk of predation. However, there is a cost to this behaviour as younger fledglings are less mobile than older fledglings: they move shorter distances and are less likely to successfully reach the communal roost tree. The optimal age to fledge young appears to depend on the trade-off between reduced nestling predation and increased fledgling mobility. We suggest that such trade-offs may be common in species where group size critically affects individual survival and reproductive success. 4 page(s...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alternative</b> {{reproductive}} <b>tactics</b> {{occur when}} individuals {{of the same}} species follow alternative ways to maximize reproductive success. Often younger and smaller males follow tactics which result in lower fitness than that of dominant larger males. The relative plasticity hypothesis predicts that hormone levels change as males change tactics, but direct tests of this hypothesis are missing. It has been demonstrated in a number of studies that males following different tactics also differ in hormone levels (unpaired data), but not that individual males change their hormone levels as they change tactic (paired data). We compared hormone levels in the same individuals before and after they changed their tactic, using field samples collected over a period of 6 years. We studied male striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) following three alternative reproductive tactics: 1. alloparental philopatric males; 2. solitary roaming males, and 3. group-living dominant breeders. Testosterone level increased and corticosterone levels decreased when philopatric males became roamers or breeders. The increase in testosterone levels tended to be higher in philopatric males that became roamers than in philopatric males that became breeders. Testosterone levels decreased when roamers became breeders. Prolactin levels increased when males of any other tactic became breeders.

The nationalization of the AIOC put Mossadeq and Britain in direct conflict, as Britain still owned half of the AIOC's stock. Iran sought the same 50-50 split of profits that had previously been granted to both Venezuela and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the oil giants of the United States of America. Britain denied Iran's request, instead choosing to keep the lion's share of the profits accrued from the production of Iranian oil.

This article is the continuation of this work. Inspired by Singer's Galois theory of difference equations we will work out several alternative characterizations of RΠΣ^*-extensions: adjoining naively sums and products leads to an RΠΣ^*-extension iff the obtained difference ring is simple iff the ring can be embedded into the ring of sequences iff the ring can be given by the interlacing of ΠΣ^*-extensions. From the viewpoint of applications this leads to a fully automatic machinery to represent indefinite nested sums and products in such RΠΣ^*-rings.

An <b>alternative</b> or supporting <b>tactic</b> <b>to</b> feigned retreats that was used by the Seljuks and others was harassing the Crusader line to disorganise it and leave it open to a cohesive cavalry charge. Crusader generals would have needed to be careful to maintain discipline in the face of losses from arrows and to keep heavy cavalry reserves to repel probing attacks. Note that this analysis is only drawn from examination mainly of some battles between 1097 and the mid 12th century, and so does not include the tactics of the entire Crusader period which only truly ended in 1302.|$|R
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of <b>alternative</b> behavioural <b>tactics</b> represents a widespread biological phenomenon. <b>Alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> (ARTs) are {{a particular case}} that has interested evolutionary ecologists since long. The butterfly Pararge aegeria {{can serve as a}} model system in this context having two male mate-locating tactics occurring simultaneously within a population. Males adopting a “perching” tactic defend a sunlit patch on the forest floor and wait for receptive females. Males adopting the <b>alternative</b> “patrolling” <b>tactic</b> fly through the habitat actively searching for females. According to game theory, the {{coexistence of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> should occur when {{the costs and benefits of}} each tactic differ in function of intrinsic or environmental factors. The overall goal of this PhD-thesis is to better understand the costs and benefits of the alternative mate-locating behaviours in P. aegeria from a conditional strategy viewpoint. To do so, we used empirical data from the field, from observations under semi-natural conditions in outdoor flight cages and from experimental work in the laboratory. (BIOL 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Explanations for the {{existence}} of <b>alternative</b> male mating <b>tactics</b> focus primarily on male [...] male competition. Mating systems, however, are composed of interactions both within and between the sexes, and the role of female behavior in shaping male mating tactics should not be overlooked. By using a dynamic state variable game model, I examine how female mate assessment and choice behavior affect the frequency of <b>alternative</b> male mating <b>tactics.</b> When females can accurately assess the quality of males, only males with high quality are likely to be chosen as mates, and thus, lower-quality males gain little fitness from courting females. This leads lower-quality males to switch <b>to</b> an <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactic</b> that attempts <b>to</b> circumvent female mate choice. In contrast, if the abilities of females to accurately assess males are constrained by assessment costs, imperfect information, or time constraints, or if the pool of available males is smaller, then lower-quality males are increasingly chosen as mates and they less often use <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactics.</b> Thus, female behavior shapes the frequency of <b>alternative</b> male mating <b>tactics.</b> A consequence of this game between the sexes is that male behavior (i. e., increased <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactics)</b> decreases the benefits females might otherwise gain from lower assessment costs, clearer signals of male quality, more time to choose a male, and more males from which to choose a mate.

40|$|Intra-sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is found}} in the weapons of many male beetles. Different behavioral <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> access females between major and minor males, which adopt fighting and <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics,</b> respectively, are thought to maintain the male dimorphism. In these species major males have enlarged weapons that they use in fights with rival males. Minor males also have small weapons in some of these species, and it is unclear why these males possess weapons. We examined the hypothesis that minor males might adopt a fighting tactic when their status was relatively high in comparison with that of other males (e. g., ownership of a territory). We observed the behavioral tactics of major and minor males of the beetle Librodor japonicus, whose males have a dimorphism of their mandibles. Major males fought for resources, whereas minor males adopted two status-dependent tactics, fighting and sneaking, to access females, depending on their ownership of a sap site. We suggest that ownership status-dependent mating tactics in minor males may maintain the intra-sexual dimorphism in this beetle. </p...|$|R
40|$|A lek-breeding cichlid fish Pseudocrenilabrus philander was studied experimentally. Females in choice-chamber {{experiments}} {{showed no}} active choice for male size and colour, or for other male attributes, but preferred males which courted most actively. In a laboratory lek, the significant determinants of the strongly skewed mating success in males were territory size, side-shake and female chasing frequency. Together these three variables explained 79 % {{of the variation}} in male mating success, with territory size alone accounting for 75 % of the variation and the other two variables each accounting for 2 % of the remaining variation. As {{there was no difference in}} territory quality in the laboratory lek, territory size became the principal measure of the effect of male-male competition since it was directly related to dominance. Both side-shake and female chasing could be identified as the basic factors influencing female choice, as they had an immediate effect on the display-response mating system of females. Thus, the relative importance of these three variables indicated that sexual selection in this particular lek mating species operated chiefly through the agency of intrasexual competition for dominance. However, both female behaviour and their requirement for a prolonged pre-spawning courtship had the effect of promoting male rivalry and favouring mating with dominant males. Although the intense male competition excluded subordinate males from practising normal courtship behaviour, competitively inferior males might "make the best of a bad situation" by facultatively adopting an <b>alternative</b> sneaking <b>tactic</b> <b>to</b> gain access to females. Spawning intrusions by females to steal freshly-laid eggs also occurred frequently. However, territorial males appeared to be relatively more tolerant of female intruders than male sneakers. Interference during spawning could lead to a longer pre-spawning courtship and even multiple-mating by females. The results of the present study and the behavioural evidence shown by males and females did not support the ʺrunaway selection modelʺ of the mating pattern in terms of sexual selection in leks, but conformed to the rival ʺwar propaganda model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Maternal {{effects are}} {{environmental}} {{influences on the}} phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in its mother, {{and are expected to}} evolve whenever females are better capable of assessing the environmental conditions that their offspring will experience than the offspring themselves. In the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, conditional male dimorphism is associated with alternative reproductive tactics: majors fight and guard females whereas minors sneak copulations. Furthermore, variation in dung beetle population density has different fitness consequences for each male morph, and theory predicts that higher population density might select for a higher frequency of minors and/or greater expenditure on weaponry in majors. Because adult dung beetles provide offspring with all the nutritional resources for their development, maternal effects strongly influence male phenotype. Results Here we tested whether female O. taurus are capable of perceiving population density, and responding by changing the phenotype of their offspring. We found that mothers who were reared with other conspecifics in their pre-mating period produced major offspring that had longer horns across a wider range of body sizes than the major offspring of females that were reared in isolation in their pre-mating period. Moreover, our results indicate that this maternal effect on male weaponry does not operate through the amount of dung provided by females to their offspring, but is rather transmitted through egg or brood mass composition. Finally, although theory predicts that females experiencing higher density might produce more minor males, we found no support for this, rather the best fitting models were equivocal as to whether fewer or the same proportions of minors were produced. Conclusions Our study describes a new type of maternal effect in dung beetles, which probably allows females to respond to population density adaptively, preparing at least their major offspring for the sexual competition they will face in the future. This new type of maternal effect in dung beetles represents a novel transgenerational response of <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> population density. </p...|$|R
40|$|The status-dependent {{selection}} {{model on}} <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> predicts a single switch-point in status: usually all players above some status (e. g., competitive ability) should practice the tactic {{with the higher}} average payoff, while those below that point should make the "best of a bad job" by practicing the <b>alternative,</b> lower payoff <b>tactic.</b> Many empirical studies indeed show a relationship between status and tactic choice, {{but they do not}} conform to this single switch-point prediction. I modify the status-dependent selection model by considering status-dependent fitness that is mediated, at least in part, by resource acquisition (e. g., status-based competition for territories or nuptial gifts). With variation in resource quality, predicted tactic-choice distributions change: a high-status male may be territorial on a high-quality territory, a lower status male may practice an <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic,</b> and an even lower status male may be territorial on a low-quality territory. Tactic choice thus alternates as in many empirical studies and can appear to be but is not actually stochastic. As the number of theoretically predicted switch-points increases, however, mixed or mixed-conditional strategies should become more prevalent. While <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> will likely usually differ in mean payoff, viewing <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> as inherently "better" or "worse" (e. g., viewing cuckoldry as "worse" [...] the best of a bad job) is misleading if not tempered with awareness that payoff can vary greatly within tactics and overlap between <b>tactics.</b> Copyright 2005. <b>alternative</b> reproductive tactic; best of a bad job; conditional strategy; cuckoldry; mixed strategy; status-dependent selection; switch-point; territoriality...|$|R
40|$|Male Nicrophorus burying beetles utilize two <b>alternative</b> mate-finding <b>tactics,</b> {{representing}} {{an ideal}} model system {{to test the}} influence of environmental cues on the expression of <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics.</b> The 2 ̆ 2 searching 2 ̆ 2 tactic involves flying {{in search of a}} carcass on which <b>to</b> mate. This <b>tactic</b> can result in high levels of paternity, but is risky in that carcasses are rare and competition for carcasses is fierce. The 2 ̆ 2 signaling 2 ̆ 2 tactic, which involves emitting pheromone {{in the absence of a}} carcass to attract females, is energetically less costly, but a signalling male must mate with multiple females to achieve the same reproductive returns as a successful searcher. Most male burying beetles employ both tactics, but the amount of time spent employing each tactic differs between individuals. Because all males are phenotypically plastic in the time invested in alternative behaviors, the expression of the <b>tactics</b> is likely <b>to</b> be condition dependent. While size has been shown to have an effect on tactic expression, it does not explain all of the variation. As a conditional-strategy, an environmental cue, such as the availability of reproductive resources, may influence the 2 ̆ 2 switchpoint 2 ̆ 2 of when one tactic yields higher fitness than the other. We tested how the expression of <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> is influenced by previous mating experience and the perceived availability of females versus carcasses by using a repeated-measures design in which mate-finding behavior of males was observed before and after exposure to: 1) multiple females but no carcasses, 2) multiple females and multiple carcasses, 3) multiple carcasses but no females, or 4) no females of carcasses (control). We found a significant time-by-treatment interaction for time invested in signaling, with both the control and multiple-female groups significantly increasing signaling time. Although the overall time-by-treatment interaction was not quite significant for time invested in searching, pairwise comparisons revealed that control, multiple-female, and multiple-carcass groups all significantly decreased time spent searching. Our results demonstrate that environmental cues do affect which <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic</b> male burying beetles employ, and that the chosen tactic is influenced by the availability of both receptive females and carcasses on which to breed...|$|R
40|$|Conditional male mating {{strategies}} {{have been studied}} extensively in relation to male attributes, such as size and resource-holding potential, but few studies have considered the effects of environmental heterogeneity {{on the use of}} <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactics.</b> In some systems, environmental heterogeneity may be the key to understanding the evolution and maintenance of such polyphenisms. I examined the influence of the physical environment on the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> by the damselfly Protoneura amatoria. Male P. amatoria reversibly use 2 <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> gain matings: 1) sit and wait in the canopy for passing females or 2) hover over the water and attempt to grab females that are ovipositing in floating debris. Observations in 3 streams indicated that the use of the hovering tactic was greater under high-light than low-light conditions and at higher densities of ovipositing females. The density of ovipositing females was correlated with both the light conditions and the availability of oviposition substrate, indicating that physical factors exert indirect as well as direct influences on tactic use. Experimental manipulations showed that both males and females responded directly to light conditions and suggested that males responded directly to the density of ovipositing females. These results can be explained largely in terms of the cues and constraints inherent in different light environments. Thus, the conditional mating strategy of P. amatoria appears to have evolved in response to, and been maintained by, fine-scale variation in the physical environment. These findings are discussed in relation to flight dynamics and predation risk. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
