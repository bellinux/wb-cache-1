5|$|Whitney {{students}} {{undergo a}} full eight-class period school day extended over two individual {{days in a}} modified block schedule. Each year, as a result, students complete eight classes. Of the 320 possible credits, 250 credits <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> graduation.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E

5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) are needed from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> processing certain substrates.|$|E

Coe Visitor Center, where 108sites are accessible by car. Near Flamingo, 234campsites with some services are also available. Recreational vehicle camping {{is available at}} these sites, but not with all necessary services. Backcountry permits <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> campsites along the Wilderness Waterway, Gulf Coast sites, and sites in the various keys.

5|$|Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, {{phosphorus}} and sulfur {{are sometimes}} referred to or categorised as organogens, CHONPS elements or biogens. Collectively these six nonmetals <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> all life on Earth. They are further distinguished—in comparison to the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) and noble gases—by their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides.|$|E
5|$|Each police {{district}} may dictate that operational personnel {{have a higher}} amount of training, for instance 80 hours is required in Oslo. Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each {{police district}}, consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of special training per year. Higher levels <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> body-guard service (55 officers) and the Emergency Response Union (73 officers). All certification curriculum is developed by and organized by the university college.|$|E
5|$|If OHS is suspected, various tests <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> its confirmation. The most {{important}} initial test is {{the demonstration of}} elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
50|$|Tubulin {{acetylation}} is {{also involved}} in regulating autophagy. It <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. When there is a nutrient deprivation, starvation-induced tubulin hyperacetylation <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> autophagy activation. This is a way activated when the cell is under stress.|$|R

5|$|In {{parliamentary}} elections, 14-member election lists may {{be submitted}} to the State Electoral Commission {{for any number of}} constituencies in Croatia. A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported by one or more political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also said}} that GRCs serve more as {{administrative}} tools than to ensure minority representation. The size of GRCs was increased {{to take advantage of}} economies of scale when managing the wards. However, whether GRCs <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> this purpose is arguable, as Goh Chok Tong stated in 1988 that MPs in SMCs could still group together after elections to enjoy economies of scale.|$|E
5|$|Permits <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> all {{overnight}} {{visits to}} the BWCAW. Quota permits <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW entry points. From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.|$|E

5|$|The {{disease is}} {{preventable}} with the polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> it to be effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and {{those who live in}} countries where the disease is occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin also {{accumulated}} HypSys {{but did not}} if the systemin precursor was silenced, {{indicating that}} in tomato, HypSys is controlled by systemin. Each of the three HypSys peptides in tomato is able to activate the synthesis and accumulation of protease inhibitors. When HypSys is silenced the production of protease inhibitors induced by wounding is halved compared to wild type plants indicating that both systemin and HypSys <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> a strong defence response against herbivores in tomato.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E
