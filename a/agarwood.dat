25|$|The {{demands for}} {{aromatic}} {{materials such as}} sandalwood, <b>agarwood,</b> and musk {{has led to the}} endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting.|$|E
25|$|Woods: Highly {{important}} in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include sandalwood, rosewood, <b>agarwood,</b> birch, cedar, juniper, and pine. These {{are used in}} the form of macerations or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.|$|E
25|$|Woody: Fragrances {{that are}} {{dominated}} by woody scents, typically of <b>agarwood,</b> sandalwood, cedarwood, and vetiver. Patchouli, with its camphoraceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. A traditional example here would be Myrurgia's Maderas De Oriente or Chanel Bois des Îles. A modern example would be Balenciaga Rumba.|$|E
5000|$|Most incense {{companies}} that make sets of [...] "Rikkoku" [...] replace these traditional <b>agarwoods</b> with available <b>agarwoods</b> that have similar scent properties to the original <b>agarwoods.</b> Baieidō has named the following <b>agarwoods</b> {{that are used in}} their incenses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Agarwood’s</b> {{use as a}} {{medicinal}} product has been recorded in the Sahih Muslim, which dates back to approximately the eighth century, and in the Ayurvedic medicinal text the Susruta Samhita.|$|R
25|$|In 1608, a red seal ship {{belonging}} to the Hinoe daimyo Arima Harunobu weathered in Macau after coming back from Cambodia to fetch a cargo of <b>agarwood,</b> intending to winter there until the monsoon of 1609. The Japanese crew behaved rowdily and walked insolently through the town in armed bands of thirty or forty. The Chinese inhabitants, greatly concerned by this, urged the Senate of Macau to curb these activities or expel the Japanese altogether. The Senate merely advised the Japanese to moderate their behaviour and disguise themselves as Chinese, but this was flatly ignored.|$|E
25|$|Physically, a pustaha {{consists}} of two hard covers (lampak) and pages made of softened tree bark (laklak) for the writings. The hard cover is usually carved with motifs of an ilik, a gecko which represents the earth deity Boraspati ni Tano, a beneficial deity of the Toba Batak. The pages is made of bark of the alim tree or the <b>agarwood</b> (Aquilaria malaccensis), softened in rice water, folded and secured between the two hard covers. The alim tree {{can be found in}} the region of Barus Hulu, around Pardomuan in Dairi Regency, and Pulau Raja in Asahan Regency. Some pustaha are made of bamboo or bone of a buffalo.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the panels}} are {{pages of the}} pustaha, which is folded like the book music used in a {{mechanical}} street organ. The 56 pages are made of the bark of the <b>agarwood</b> (Aquilaria malaccensis). The bark reaches 17 meters in length if unfolded. The ink is made of tree resin mixed with other ingredients and boiled. Bamboo skewers, buffalo horn or the grain of a sugar palm leaf {{is used for the}} writing. The content of the Great Pustaha are descriptions of all kinds of spells and incantations needed by the datu. Among the formula contained within the pustaha is a formula to destroy other villages or eliminating opponents, for inspiring love, and stories about the creation of the world.|$|E
2500|$|Beside rafting, many admire Gaharu from Gaharu Tea Valley Gopeng {{a kind of}} <b>Agarwood</b> {{which can}} be {{processed}} as tea. Rumor has it that whoever captures a picture with the tall King Wood will bring in a windfall. Hong Kong famous director Raymond Wong Bak-Ming believed had a very {{close relationship with the}} farm owner.|$|E
50|$|Baieidō also pioneered {{research}} {{into the history of}} <b>agarwood</b> (also called aloeswood). http://www.japanese-incense.com/aloeswood.htm <b>Agarwood</b> refers to a resin that develops from some trees in the Aquilaria genus that are infected with a fungus. The tree produces a resin to protect itself against the fungus. This resin is <b>agarwood.</b> Japanese incense often uses 2 common terms for agarwood: jinkō （沈香） and kyara （伽羅）. Jinkō refers to any kind of <b>agarwood.</b> Kyara refers to one specific type of <b>agarwood.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Both <b>agarwood</b> and its resin distillate/extracts {{are known}} as oud (عود) in Arabic (literally [...] "rod/stick") and used to {{describe}} <b>agarwood</b> in Arab countries. Western perfumers also often use <b>agarwood</b> essential oil under the name [...] "oud" [...] or [...] "oudh".|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{ingredient in}} Japanese incense is kyara (伽羅). Kyara is {{one kind of}} <b>agarwood</b> (Japanese incense companies divide <b>agarwood</b> into 6 categories depending on the region obtained and properties of the <b>agarwood).</b> Kyara is currently worth more than its weight in gold.|$|E
5000|$|In Bengali, <b>agarwood</b> {{is known}} as [...] "agor/agoro gach (আগর গাছ)" [...] and the <b>agarwood</b> oil as [...] "agor/agoro attor (আগর আতর)".|$|E
5000|$|Together with Aquilaria {{the genus}} {{is best known}} as the {{principal}} producer of the resin-suffused <b>agarwood.</b> The depletion of wild trees from indiscriminate cutting for <b>agarwood</b> has resulted in the trees being listed and protected as an endangered species.|$|E
50|$|The {{depletion}} of wild trees from indiscriminate cutting for <b>agarwood</b> {{has resulted in}} the trees being listed and protected as an endangered species.

50|$|First-grade <b>agarwood</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} natural raw materials in the world, with 2010 prices for superior pure material as high as US$100,000/kg, although in practice adulteration of the wood and oil is common, allowing for prices as low as US$100/kg. A whole range of qualities and products are on the market, varying in quality with geographical location, botanical species, the age of the specific tree, cultural deposition and the section of the tree where the piece of <b>agarwood</b> stems from. Oud oil is distilled from <b>agarwood,</b> and fetches high prices depending on the oil's purity. The current global market for <b>agarwood</b> is estimated to be in the range of US$6 - 8 billion and is growing rapidly.|$|E
50|$|Overharvesting {{and habitat}} loss threatens some populations of agarwood-producing species. Concern over {{the impact of}} the global demand for <b>agarwood</b> has thus led to the {{inclusion}} of the main taxa on CITES Appendix II, which requires that international trade in <b>agarwood</b> be monitored. Monitoring is conducted by London based TRAFFIC (a joint WWF and IUCN programme). CITES also provides that international trade in <b>agarwood</b> be subject to controls designed to ensure that harvest and exports are not {{to the detriment of the}} survival of the species in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The genus is best known, {{together}} with Gyrinops, {{as the principal}} producer of the resin-suffused <b>agarwood,</b> especially Aquilaria malaccensis. The depletion of wild trees from indiscriminate cutting for <b>agarwood</b> {{has resulted in the}} trees being listed and protected as an endangered species. Projects are currently underway in some countries in southeast Asia to infect cultivated Aquilaria trees artificially to produce <b>agarwood</b> in a sustainable manner. In Indonesia, for example, there have been proposals to encourage the planting of gahara, as it is known as locally, in eastern Indonesia, particularly in the province of Papua.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{geography}} and climate of Pursat, Aquilaria thrives in the forest. Aquilaria species, specifically Aquilaria crassna, {{infected with the}} parasitic mold Phaeoacremonium parasitica {{are the source of}} <b>Agarwood.</b> There was an abundance in wild <b>Agarwood</b> during the early centuries. Due to its distinct fragrance, many trees were sought after and felled for gift offerings to the royal family and officials.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fragrant}} woods <b>agarwood</b> and sandalwood are {{the main}} ingredients used in Japanese incense. <b>Agarwood</b> is produced {{in certain parts of}} southeast Asia such as Vietnam. Japanese incense companies divide <b>agarwood</b> into six categories depending on the region obtained and properties of the <b>agarwood.</b> The trees secrete an aromatic resin, which over time turns into kōboku. One particular grade of kōboku with a high oil content and superior fragrance is called kyara. Kyara is currently worth more than its weight in gold. Sandalwood originates primarily from India, Indonesia, southern China or other parts of southeast Asia. Sandalwood trees need around 60 years to produce their signature fragrance that can be deemed acceptable to be used for kōdo. The most valued sandalwood comes from Mysore in the state of Karnataka in India, where it is endangered. Makkō (which translates as [...] "incense powder") is used to bind the ingredients together. It is able to bind ingredients while having little scent of its own.|$|E
