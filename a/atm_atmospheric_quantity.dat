40|$|The {{reliability}} of astronomical observations at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths closely {{depends on a}} low vertical content of water vapor {{as well as on}} high atmospheric emission stability. Although Concordia station at Dome C (Antarctica) enjoys good observing conditions in this atmospheric spectral windows, as shown by preliminary site-testing campaigns at different bands and in, not always, time overlapped periods, a dedicated instrument able to continuously determine atmospheric performance for a wide spectral range is not yet planned. In the absence of such measurements, in this paper we suggest a semi-empirical approach to perform an analysis of atmospheric transmission and emission at Dome C to compare the performance for 7 photometric bands ranging from 100 GHz to 2 THz. Radiosoundings data provided by the Routine Meteorological Observations (RMO) Research Project at Concordia station are corrected by temperature and humidity errors and dry biases and then employed to feed <b>ATM</b> (<b>Atmospheric</b> Transmission at Microwaves) code to generate synthetic spectra in the wide spectral range from 100 GHz to 2 THz. To quantify the atmospheric contribution in millimeter and sub-millimeter observations we are considering several photometric bands in which <b>atmospheric</b> <b>quantities</b> are integrated. The observational capabilities of this site at all the selected spectral bands are analyzed considering monthly averaged transmissions joined to the corresponding fluctuations. Transmission and pwv statistics at Dome C derived by our semi-empirical approach are consistent with previous works. It is evident the decreasing of the performance at high frequencies. We propose to introduce a new parameter to compare the quality of a site at different spectral bands, in terms of high transmission and emission stability, the Site Photometric Quality Factor.

For temperature experiments, ten 24 hour trials were conducted each at 10. 5 °C and 7 °C, using flow-through respirometry. Average routine VO 2 was approximately 130 mg O 2 /(kg*hr) at 10. 5 °C and approximately 120 mg O 2 /(kg*hr) at 7 °C. These values did not differ significantly, probably because we used temperatures spanning the thermal range of bloater, within which this species may conserve routine metabolism. Derivations of daily food ration for bloater were calculated and compared with a previous bioenergetics model. For pressure experiments, the diel vertical migrations bloater undertake in the wild were simulated using a flow-through respirometer that could be pressurized. Ten 3 -day trials were conducted, consisting of an overnight acclimation to the respirometer, a 12 -hour pressure regime, and a day of recovery. The pressure regime involved a compression from 1 <b>atm</b> (<b>atmospheric</b> pressure) to 4 atm over 6 hours and a subsequent decompression of the same magnitude and duration. Increases in hydrostatic pressure elicited a rise in bloater VO 2 and motor activity; conversely, the subsequent decrease in hydrostatic pressure caused a return of oxygen uptake and motor activity to baseline values at 1 atm.

Two distinct structural sites hosting Ar isotopes can be identified {{in light of their}} degassing behaviors obtained by incremental heating analyses.

The second sites yield predominantly Ar- 40 * (radiogenic Ar- 40), Ar- 39 (K), and Ar- 38 (K) (nucleogenic components), at similar to 0. 5 - 1. 0 W.

The excellent match between the degassing behaviors of Ar- 40 *, Ar- 39 (K), and Ar- 38 (K) suggests that these isotopes occupy the same crystallographic sites and that Ar- 39 (K) loss from the tunnel site by recoil during neutron irradiation and/or bake-out procedure preceding isotopic analysis does not occur.
