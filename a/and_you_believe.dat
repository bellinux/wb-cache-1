500|$|The filmmakers {{determined}} {{early on}} {{that the role of}} Sonny was crucial to the outcome of the picture, and they selected Dev Patel, who at the time was still revelling in the success of Slumdog Millionaire. Dench described Patel as a [...] "born comedian", and Madden considered him to be a [...] "comic natural—a sort of Jacques Tati figure, with amazing physical presence and fantastic instincts". Patel had personal experience of watching the elderly through his mother who had been a carer, and he was [...] "enticed by how vivid these characters are, by their sarcasm and their wisdom", confessing that he [...] "fell in love with the script because every character shines {{in his or her own}} different way <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in each of them." [...] Lilette Dubey was cast as Sonny's mother, and English-language debutante Tina Desai portrayed Sunaina, Sonny's call-centre-operator girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} cast {{relatively unknown}} British actors for the series. Scottish actress Lindsay Duncan, who was cast as Servilia, {{believed that she}} and other UK actors [...] "can do old, can do classic, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it." [...] She also said that because of long distances, [...] American actors or those of other nationalities were avoided: [...] "Transporting actors from [...] to Rome {{on a regular basis}} does not look good for the budget. We're quite cheap." [...] Stamp described Servilia as [...] "the great love of [...] Caesar's life, his mistress and by all counts the only woman he truly loved." [...] Irish actor Ciarán Hinds was cast as Caesar. Hinds first thought it was [...] "silly" [...] to be offered the part, but then [...] "you think it's quite an honour to be chosen to play it. And then you think, 'Oh shit I've got to do it', and then, well, 'I suppose someone has to do it!'" [...] Heller had believed that Hinds would make [...] "a great Caesar" [...] for a long time, and considered the series [...] "extremely lucky" [...] for being able to cast him.|$|E

2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it is worth something. You have no idea {{what is going to happen}} to you.

Both were, at least carnally, {{children}} of Israel: they spoke Hebrew to the Hebrews. The prophets were only Hebrews; the apostles were only Hebrews. The churches of Asia, which have vanished, were founded by a native Hebrew; and the church of Rome, which says it shall last for ever, and which converted this island to the faith of Moses and of Christ, vanquishing the Druids, Jupiter Olympius, and Woden, who had successively invaded it, was also founded by a native Hebrew. Therefore, I say, your suspicion or your conviction is, at least, not a fantastic one.' ...|$|E

60|$|This {{case has}} a certain {{interest}} à propos of Mr. Podmore's surmise that all such phenomena arise in trickery, which produces excitement in the spectators, while excitement begets hallucination, and hallucination {{takes the form of}} seeing the thrown objects move in a non-natural way. Thus, I keep throwing things about. You, not detecting this stratagem, get excited, consequently hallucinated, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> you see the things move in spirals, or undulate as if on waves, or hop, or float, or glide in an impossible way. So close is the uniformity of hallucination that these phenomena are described, in similar terms, by witnesses (hallucinated, of course) in times old and new, as in cases cited by Glanvil, Increase Mather, Telfer (of Rerrick), and, generally, in works of the seventeenth century. Nor is this uniform hallucination confined to England. Mr. Podmore quotes a German example, and I received a similar testimony (to the flight of an object round a corner) from a gentleman who employed Esther Teed, 'the Amherst Mystery,' in his service. He was not excited, for he was normally engaged in his normal stable, when the incident occurred unexpectedly as he was looking after his live stock. One may add the case of Cideville (1851) and Sir W. Crookes's evidence, and that of Mr. Schhapoff.|$|E
6000|$|My love! nay, rather, my damnation thou, [...] Said he: nor am I {{bound to}} keep my vow: [...] The fiend thy sire hath sent thee from below, [...] Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know? [...] 330 [...] Avaunt, old witch! for I renounce thy bed: [...] The queen may take the forfeit of my head, [...] Ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed. [...] Both heard, the judge {{pronounced}} against the knight; [...] So was he married in his own despite; [...] And all day after hid him as an owl, [...] Not able to sustain a sight so foul. [...] Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong, [...] To pass the marriage feast, and nuptial song: [...] Mirth there was none, the man was a-la-mort, [...] 340 [...] And little courage had to make his court. [...] To bed they went, the bridegroom and the bride: [...] Was never such an ill-pair'd couple tied, [...] Restless, he toss'd and tumbled to and fro, [...] And roll'd, and wriggled further off, for woe. [...] The good old wife lay smiling by his side, [...] And caught him in her quivering arms, and cried, [...] When you my ravish'd predecessor saw, [...] You were not then become this man of straw; [...] Had you been such, you might have 'scaped the law. [...] 350 [...] Is this the custom of King Arthur's court? [...] Are all round-table knights of such a sort? [...] Remember, I am she who saved your life, [...] Your loving, lawful, and complying wife: [...] Not thus you swore in your unhappy hour, [...] Nor I for this return employ'd my power. [...] In time of need I was your faithful friend; [...] Nor did I since, nor ever will offend. [...] Believe me, my loved lord, 'tis much unkind; [...] What fury has possess'd your alter'd mind? [...] 360 [...] Thus on my wedding night--without pretence-- [...] Come turn this way, or tell me my offence. [...] If not your wife, let reason's rule persuade; [...] Name but my fault, amends shall soon be made. [...] Amends! nay, that's impossible, said he, [...] What change of age or ugliness can be? [...] Or could Medea's magic mend thy face, [...] Thou art descended from so mean a race, [...] That never knight was match'd with such disgrace. [...] What wonder, madam, if I move my side, [...] 370 [...] When, if I turn, I turn to such a bride? [...] And is this all that troubles you so sore? [...] And what the devil couldst thou wish me more? [...] Ah, Benedicite, replied the crone; [...] Then cause of just complaining have you none. [...] The remedy to this were soon applied, [...] Would you be like the bridegroom to the bride: [...] But, for you say a long descended race, [...] And wealth and dignity, and power and place, [...] Make gentlemen, and that your high degree [...] 380 [...] Is much disparaged to be match'd with me; [...] Know this, my lord, nobility of blood [...] Is but a glittering and fallacious good: [...] The nobleman is he, whose noble mind [...] Is fill'd with inborn worth, unborrow'd from his kind. [...] The King of Heaven was in a manger laid, [...] And took his earth but from an humble maid; [...] Then what can birth, or mortal men, bestow? [...] Since floods no higher than their fountains flow. [...] We, who for name and empty honour strive, [...] 390 [...] Our true nobility from him derive. [...] Your ancestors, who puff your mind with pride, [...] And vast estates to mighty titles tied, [...] Did not your honour, but their own, advance; [...] For virtue comes not by inheritance. [...] If you tralineate from your father's mind, [...] What are you else but of a bastard kind? [...] Do, as your great progenitors have done, [...] And, by their virtues, prove yourself their son. [...] No father can infuse or wit or grace; [...] 400 [...] A mother comes across, and mars the race. [...] A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood; [...] And seldom three descents continue good. [...] Were virtue by descent, a noble name [...] Could never villanise his father's fame; [...] But, as the first, the last of all the line, [...] Would, like the sun, even in descending shine; [...] Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house, [...] Betwixt King Arthur's court and Caucasus: [...] If you depart, the flame shall still remain, [...] 410 [...] And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain: [...] Nor, till the fuel perish, can decay, [...] By nature form'd on things combustible to prey. [...] Such is not man, who, mixing better seed [...] With worse, begets a base degenerate breed: [...] The bad corrupts the good, and leaves behind [...] No trace of all the great begetter's mind. [...] The father sinks within his son, we see, [...] And often rises in the third degree; [...] If better luck a better mother give, [...] 420 [...] Chance gave us being, and by chance we live. [...] Such as our atoms were, even such are we, [...] Or call it chance, or strong necessity: [...] Thus loaded with dead weight, the will is free. [...] And thus it needs must be; for seed conjoin'd [...] Lets into nature's work the imperfect kind; [...] But fire, the enlivener of the general frame, [...] Is one, its operation still the same. [...] Its principle is in itself: while ours [...] Works, as confederates war, with mingled powers; [...] 430 [...] Or man or woman, which soever fails: [...] And oft the vigour of the worse prevails. [...] Aether with sulphur blended alters hue, [...] And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue. [...] Thus, in a brute, their ancient honour ends, [...] And the fair mermaid in a fish descends: [...] The line is gone; no longer duke or earl; [...] But, by himself degraded, turns a churl. [...] Nobility of blood is but renown [...] Of thy great fathers by their virtue known, [...] 440 [...] And a long trail of light, to thee descending down. [...] If in thy smoke it ends, their glories shine; [...] But infamy and villanage are thine. [...] Then what I said before is plainly show'd, [...] The true nobility proceeds from God; [...] Nor left us by inheritance, but given [...] By bounty of our stars, and grace of Heaven. [...] Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose, [...] Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose: [...] Fabricius from their walls repell'd the foe, [...] 450 [...] Whose noble hands had exercised the plough. [...] From hence, my lord, and love, I thus conclude, [...] That though my homely ancestors were rude, [...] Mean as I am, yet I may have the grace [...] To make you father of a generous race: [...] And noble then am I, when I begin, [...] In virtue clothed, to cast the rags of sin. [...] If poverty be my upbraided crime, [...] <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in Heaven, {{there was a time}} [...] When He, the great controller of our fate, [...] 460 [...] Deign'd to be man, and lived in low estate; [...] Which He who had the world at his dispose, [...] If poverty were vice, would never choose. [...] Philosophers have said, and poets sing, [...] That a glad poverty's an honest thing. [...] Content is wealth, the riches of the mind; [...] And happy he who can that treasure find. [...] But the base miser starves amidst his store, [...] Broods on his gold, and, griping still at more, [...] Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor. [...] 470 [...] The ragged beggar, though he want relief, [...] Has not to lose, and sings before the thief. [...] Want is a bitter and a hateful good, [...] Because its virtues are not understood; [...] Yet many things, impossible to thought, [...] Have been by need to full perfection brought: [...] The daring of the soul proceeds from thence, [...] Sharpness of wit, and active diligence: [...] Prudence at once, and fortitude, it gives, [...] And, if in patience taken, mends our lives; [...] 480 [...] For even that indigence, that brings me low, [...] Makes me myself, and Him above, to know. [...] A good which none would challenge, few would choose, [...] A fair possession, which mankind refuse. [...] If we from wealth to poverty descend, [...] Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend. [...] If I am old and ugly, well for you, [...] No lewd adulterer will my love pursue; [...] Nor jealousy, the bane of married life, [...] Shall haunt you for a wither'd homely wife; [...] 490 [...] For age and ugliness, as all agree, [...] Are the best guards of female chastity. [...] Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent, [...] I'll do my best to further your content. [...] And therefore of two gifts in my dispose, [...] Think ere you speak, I grant you leave to choose: [...] Would you I should be still deform'd and old, [...] Nauseous to touch, and loathsome to behold; [...] On this condition to remain for life, [...] A careful, tender, and obedient wife, [...] 500 [...] In all I can contribute to your ease, [...] And not in deed, or word, or thought displease: [...] Or would you rather have me young and fair, [...] And take the chance that happens to your share? [...] Temptations are in beauty, and in youth, [...] And how can you depend upon my truth? [...] Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss, [...] And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss.|$|E
