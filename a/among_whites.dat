5|$|<b>Among</b> <b>whites,</b> gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Irataba (Mohave: eecheeyara tav , {{also known}} as Yara tav, Yarate:va, Arateve; – 1874) was {{a leader of the}} Mohave Nation, known for his role as a {{mediator}} between his people and the United States. He was born near the Colorado River in present-day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator {{and one of the first}} Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Early records mention his large physical size and gentle demeanor. Irataba first encountered European Americans in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which would take them to southern California. He later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> as the most important native leader in the region.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1970s, {{fundamentalist}} conservative {{churches have}} grown rapidly, fueling Mississippi's conservative political trends <b>among</b> <b>whites.</b> In 1973 the Presbyterian Church in America attracted numerous conservative congregations.

25|$|When cotton {{was king}} during the 1850s, Mississippi {{plantation}} owners—especially {{those of the}} Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, {{the high price of}} cotton on the international market, and their assets in slaves. They used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances <b>among</b> <b>whites,</b> played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for secession. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.|$|E
25|$|By 1960 African Americans {{comprised}} 16.45% of the state's population.

25|$|Historically, interracial {{marriage}} in the United States was of great public opposition (often a taboo), especially <b>among</b> <b>whites.</b> According to opinion polls, by 1986 only one third of Americans approved of interracial {{marriage in}} general.

25|$|It {{had been}} {{suggested}} that education has {{a positive impact on}} support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same-sex marriage as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary black {{commentators}} {{argued that}} to white audiences, Connelly's The Green Pastures simply reinforced {{the notion that}} black people presented a danger {{that needed to be}} contained. Weisenfeld argues that this is also the case with Freleng's parody. To white viewers in the 1930s, the film's implication that blacks care for nothing but gambling, drinking, and dancing only reinforces notions of the dangers posed by urban blacks. According to Goldmark, the choice of performers caricatured is telling; that Armstrong and Calloway are depicted as angels indicates that their crossover appeal was strong enough <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> that white audiences would not have felt threatened by the notion that they were angels in Heaven. Weisenfeld notes that by focusing the narrative on Saint Peter and his Stepin Fetchit underling, the animators ducked the potential offense white audiences might have felt upon seeing a black God.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Race {{relations}} {{have long been}} a blind spot <b>among</b> <b>white</b> evangelical Christians. Yet in the past 15 years, {{there has been an}} explicit acknowledgement <b>among</b> <b>white</b> evangelicals of the need for racial reconciliation with minorities who share their evangelical faith. That acknowledgement has been accompanied by tangible efforts to work toward that end, albeit with modest success. This essay examines evangelical attitudes on race <b>among</b> <b>white</b> and minority evangelicals. It explores the unique potential that exists within evangelical churches for genuine racial reconciliation, as well as the significant obstacles rooted both {{in the nature of the}} evangelical faith tradition and in the broader contemporary political culture. Finally, the paper outlines a theologically derived public policy agenda around which racial reconciliation might be advanced, within evangelical churches and in society at large...|$|R

25|$|Slave {{owners had}} {{more control over}} the state {{government}} of South Carolina than of any other state. Elite planters played the role of English aristocrats more than did the planters of other states. In the late antebellum years, the newer Southern states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, allowed more political equality <b>among</b> <b>whites.</b> Although all white male residents were allowed to vote, property requirements for office holders were higher in South Carolina than in any other state. It was the only state legislature in which slave owners held the majority of seats. The legislature elected the governor, all judges and state electors for federal elections, as well as the US senators into the 20th century, so its members had considerable political power. The state's chief executive was a figurehead who had no authority to veto legislative law.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{recognized}} as such by Mexico, Texas declared itself an independent nation, the Republic of Texas. Attracted {{by the rich}} lands for cotton plantations and ranching, {{tens of thousands of}} immigrants arrived from the U.S. and from Germany as well. In 1845, Texas joined the United States, becoming the 28th state, when the United States annexed it. Only after the conclusion of the Mexican-American War, with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, did Mexico recognize Texan independence. Texas declared its secession from the United States in 1861 to join the Confederate States of America. Only a few battles of the American Civil War were fought in Texas; most Texas regiments served in the east. When the war ended, the enslaved African Americans were freed. Texas was subject to Reconstruction, a process that left a residue of bitterness <b>among</b> <b>whites.</b> They regained political dominance and passed laws in the late 19th century creating second-class status for blacks in a Jim Crow system of segregation and disenfranchising them in 1901 through passage of a poll tax. Blacks were excluded from the formal political system until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.|$|E
