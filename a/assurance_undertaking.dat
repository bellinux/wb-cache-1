5000|$|In Cases E-15/15 and 16/15, Vienna Life and Swiss Life, the Court {{ruled on}} the {{interpretation}} of Directive 2002/83/EC concerning life assurance. It held that Article 36(1) of the Directive does not address legal transactions according to which an existing unit-linked life assurance policy is transferred via a purchase agreement {{from one person to}} another where the insured risk, namely the insured person, under the assurance policy remains the same. Furthermore, a transfer of a unit-linked life assurance policy does not constitute a change in the policy conditions under Article 36(2) unless the terms of an assurance policy are also amended, thereby altering the balance of rights and obligations of the parties to an assurance contract. With regard to the referring court’s further questions on specific information duties under the Directive, the Court found, first, that if a “change in the policy conditions” within the meaning of the Directive has taken place, the referring court needs to consider whether the information listed in Annex III(B)(b)(2) was provided to the second-hand policy holder in a clear, accurate and complete manner and in an official language of the EEA State of commitment. Second, it is of no significance for the information obligation of the <b>assurance</b> <b>undertaking</b> whether the former policy holder was an undertaking and the new policy holder is a consumer, unless this difference has led to an amendment to the terms of the assurance contract. Neither is it of significance whether or not the original policy holder disclosed information about himself so that his own risk or investor profile could be assessed. As to the referring court’s question whether Annex III to the Directive has been correctly transposed into Liechtenstein law, the Court held that directives must be implemented into the national legal order of the EEA States with unquestionable binding force and the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty. Furthermore, national courts are bound to interpret national law in conformity with EEA law. Under Article 34 SCA, the Court has jurisdiction to give advisory opinions on {{the interpretation of}} the EEA Agreement upon the request of national courts. After the Court has rendered its judgment, it falls to the referring court to interpret national law in light of the Court’s findings. In cases where a harmonious interpretation of national law is not sufficient to achieve the result sought by the relevant EEA rule, that matter can be brought before the Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 31 SCA.|$|E
40|$|Extract] This chapter {{focuses on}} some current {{challenges}} and opportunities regarding post-harvest quality in farmed Lates calcarifer. The post-harvest quality of farmed seabass {{is an area that}} has been largely overlooked and somewhat neglected. This is in direct contrast to many farmed temperate fish species where there has been and remains a concentrated focus on optimising post-harvest quality. This focus in temperate species stems from the recognition that consumer demand and confidence is directly linked to product quality and is consequently a key driver of increased production and producer returns. As with wild fisheries, aquaculture has traditionally focused on quality <b>assurance</b> (<b>undertaking</b> a series of planned and systematic actions that secure quality) and quality control (operational techniques and activities that are used to satisfy requirements for quality) measures (see Connell 1995). However, unlike capture fisheries, aquaculture provides an unique opportunity to manipulate, or actively control, the intrinsic qualities of the product prior to harvest, thus better meeting consumer preferences and expectations. The focus of this chapter is to highlight the {{challenges and opportunities}} for improving post-harvest quality of farmed L. calcarifer. Due to a lack of research elsewhere, the chapter will primarily use challenges faced by the Australian barramundi industry as the illustrative example...|$|E

30|$|At present, early {{childhood}} education {{is not part of}} the universal and compulsory system of education in Hong Kong. All pre-primary services are run by non-profit-making institutions or private independent bodies in Hong Kong. The operation of pre-primary services is largely market driven. According to the organic system model, the development of pre-primary services in Hong Kong had gone through a period of stable development with self-managing institutions which have placed an emphasis on internal effectiveness in the early stages. Since 1997, the services have undergone changes that have been brought forth by the education reforms which hinted upon the interface effectiveness between the pre-primary services operators and the government. Taking effect from 2007, the pre-primary institutions experienced a period of enhanced development under the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme. This period stressed the importance of intraface effectiveness among the key stakeholders—parents, professionals and government. Upon the implementation of the education voucher scheme, a Quality Review system was poised to ensure the deliver of standards-based quality pre-primary services with a clear vision and sense of mission, performance indicators, as well as intended and expected outcomes. The Quality Review aimed to adopt a two-pronged approach based on internal quality <b>assurances</b> <b>undertaken</b> by School Self-evaluations and external school reviews. It can be argued that this represents the best way to improve standards through the collaborative efforts of pre-primary institutions and the government. All pre-primary institutions under the Scheme should be accountable to their stakeholders by optimizing the school data by perfecting their planning cycle through on-going process of self-evaluation, while the government should monitor the state of education at both the national and district levels. The Quality Review is the lever of change that has a direct bearing on the quality performance of pre-primary institutions, children’s learning and leadership issues at both the school and system levels.|$|R

40|$|Issue: Container {{manufacturing}} is {{the primary}} market for recycled glass cullet in the United States. Although all container manufacturers use some recycled cullet in glass batches, {{there is a lack}} of uniform specifications for both recycled glass and furnace-ready cullet. This can represent a significant market barrier to processors of recycled glass seeking to access the primary market. Often processors design systems to meet the needs of specific manufacturers. This can leave processors vulnerable to changes in the consumption patterns of a single manufacturer. Industry-wide quality requirements are needed to ensure that suppliers have equal access to container manufacturing markets. Further, specifications written at the corporate level are subject to interpretation at the plant level. Plant engineers may have expectations of cullet that are more or less stringent than the written specifications. As a result, the quality <b>assurance</b> procedures <b>undertaken</b> by those managers may tend to be more subjective than specifications suggest. Best Practice: The next page contains a specification derived from existing specifications and interviews with processors and users. It may serve to educate those unfamiliar with cullet specifications and as a starting point for development of uniform specifications. Implementation:Incipient trading in recycled glass on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) may help to open an industry-wide discussion for the establishment of uniform specifications. Whether or not CBOT trading succeeds, that discussion should continue within the glass manufacturing industry. Benefits: The existence of well-defined industry specifications can potentially be a benefit to both processors and users of furnace-ready cullet. Processors can design their systems knowing that they are not subject to the whims of a single buyer. Buyers can purchase from multiple sources with confidence that processors understand industry quality standards...|$|R

Tartan Racing of Carnegie Mellon University won with Boss, a modified Chevrolet Tahoe with multiple laser and radar sensors, GPS, a rack of computers, and over 400 000 lines of C++ code to run the show. The team followed a formal quality <b>assurance</b> regime, <b>undertaking</b> frequent whole system tests, code inspections, and bug tracking. Static code analysis tools were not used, partially due to mistrust of and unfamiliarity with tools capable of analyzing C++ code. In this project we evaluated two C++ static analysis tools on the Tartan Racing code in an effort to determine how helpful they would have been to the project. One of these tools was Coverity Prevent (the other has been excised from this document due to confidentiality constraints). This project was undertaken with the generous support of Coverity, who offered their tools for this evaluation. 1. Coverity Prevent Coverity Prevent gave a good impression in terms of its appearance, documentation, cleaner and simpler build process. It has support for tracking multiple analysis runs on an evolving code base and keeping track of the same issues within the code even as the code evolved.

40|$|The growing {{pressure}} for public disclosure on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions {{has led to}} a significant demand for assurance on GHG statements. Given the complexity of GHG assurance, the international GHG assurance standard requires multidisciplinary GHG assurance teams (MDGHGTs) comprising practitioners from accounting and non-accounting background to discuss and assesses the risks of material misstatements in the planning stage of the engagement. However, prior research highlights the difficulties, including impaired effectiveness, associated with integrating practitioners from a range of disciplines, and as such suggests the importance of identifying mechanisms to ensure the effectiveness of MDGHGTs is not impaired. This dissertation addresses the effectiveness of MDGHGTs through two studies. Study One utilises a retrospective recall approach to explore the factors that GHG assurers perceive could affect the effectiveness of MDGHGTs. This study finds that team processes are crucial to the success of MDGHGTs. In particular, having sufficient elaboration on different perspectives significantly increases the perceived effectiveness of MDGHGTs. This study also finds that the perceived sufficiency of elaboration increases when MDGHGTs become more educationally diverse, while the perceived sufficiency of discussion time decreases when the MDGHGTs become larger. Study Two focuses on MDGHGT processes through a controlled experiment examining the effect of three team formats (nominal, interacting and review teams), on MDGHGT risk assessment performance. This study finds that accountant and non-accountant practitioners differ in the types of risks they generate, supporting the need for additional expertise over and above that provided by an accountant assurer. However, this study also finds that while review and nominal teams achieve a similar performance level in the GHG risk assessment task, MDGHGTs do not benefit from performing this task in an interactive manner. These findings suggest that MDGHGTs {{may not be able to}} capitalise on the benefits of the diverse knowledge and perspectives brought to the team by individual team members due to process losses occurring when these perspectives require discussion and reconciliation by the team. These findings thereby have implications for the team processes employed by <b>assurance</b> firms <b>undertaking</b> GHG <b>assurance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract In New Zealand's {{compulsory}} education sector quality <b>assurance</b> is <b>undertaken</b> by the Education Review Office (ERO). When a school {{is found to}} be less effective than is acceptable through the triennial review process, ERO may return to review that school within six or twelve months. This Supplementary Review is identified to the Ministry of Education (MOE) which has several levels of intervention at its disposal which can be employed singularly or in concert to improve the school. Despite the support and interventions funded and/or managed by MOE, some schools have consecutive Supplementary Reviews and some remain under Statutory Intervention for several years. Commonalities among these schools that repeatedly or consistently present as 'at risk' may indicate a need for greater or different support or intervention. Self managing schools, while effective for many schools, may not be a workable and sustainable proposition for others. This may well be particularly true for those schools identified as 'at risk'. This paper considers ERO's process to identify schools 'at risk' and subsequent interventions employed by MOE to support the Principal and Board of Trustees in addressing improvements required within the school. Statistics and document analysis were used to extract data from documents with findings presented as a series of tables. It seeks a match between what is identified by ERO and the Statutory Intervention engaged by MOE. It explores the commonalities of schools under Statutory Intervention and on Supplementary Review. Practice in other countries is also considered in an effort to understand and contextualise the ideas and beliefs that support these approaches. While there is evidence ERO identifies teacher and Principal performance as major areas of concern, lead issues for Statutory Interventions in the same schools focus on the performance of the Board of Trustees as those with the responsibility of governing the school. The focus on governance to improve school performance is not working for some schools, more or different support may be necessary to effect positive change. The balance between capacity building, incentives and accountability for all involved in schools with Statutory Interventions, appears necessary for those with the capacity to improve...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{reporting}} assurance {{is considered}} as a practice that enhances the credibility and quality of reported information (Dando and Swift, 2003; ACCA, 2004). However, studies have found significant variances and inconsistencies that exist across assurance statements but {{little attention has been}} paid to understanding more about the nature of the variances beyond the examination of assurance statements. The apparent variances affect the ability of sustainability assurance to deliver robust levels of stakeholder accountability; as such a detailed exploration behind the dynamics of stakeholder consideration in the practice is required. Hence, this study presents an updated and expanded assessment of sustainability reporting assurance practices by adopting a three-stage mixed methods investigative approach. The first stage is a content analysis of assurance statements published by FTSE 350 companies using a specifically developed evaluation template. Core elements such as scope of assurance, level of assurance, addresses, guidelines used, independence of assurance providers, <b>assurance</b> work <b>undertaken,</b> stakeholder consideration and conclusions were of particular focus. Data obtained on these elements were explored further in the subsequent stages of the study. The second stage involved semi-structured interviews with 13 assurance providers focusing on their roles in the process and the apparent variances that appear in assurance statements. The third stage is comprised of further semi-structured interviews with representatives of 11 different stakeholders. All data generated were analysed and interpreted through the audit theoretical conception by Power (1991, 1994, 1999) as well as the legitimacy, institutional and stakeholder theories. Sustainability reporting assurance remains largely a valuable practice but there is a fundamental absence of consistent and comprehensive shared meaning and approach on the practice. This has manifested in the different application of sustainability assurance processes thus making it challenging for a single approach to be generally accepted. Also, considerable evidence of managerial capture was observed as assurance providers confirmed the vast degree of influence exerted by reporting companies in assurance processes, an issue that no direct solution or effort was acknowledged to assist in alleviating. The presence of a sustainability assurance expectations gap serves as a key factor that drives the severe caution expressed by stakeholders about the practice. The lack of stakeholder influence was apparent, thus limiting their ability to put companies and assurance providers under pressure towards a more stakeholder oriented provision of sustainability assurance. In general, the findings of this study call into question the ability of the current state of sustainability reporting assurance to enhance transparency and hence discharge effective corporate accountability to stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Internationally {{there is}} {{pressure}} for {{significant change in}} measuring quality {{in teaching and learning}} (Krause, Barrie & Scot t, 2012). Different national approaches to quality <b>assurance</b> have been <b>undertaken.</b> In Brazil national examinations take place; in the U. S., the Collegiate Learning Assessment has been adopted by over 400 universities; again in the U. S. the Voluntary System s of Accountability have been implemented; and the Quality Assurance Agency in the U. K. use external examiners and benchmark standards. It is evident that although quality assurance has been recognised as a critical component of educational enhancement principles there is little consistency as to how to achieve it. Of more concern, is the validity of the data being used to assure quality. Sadler (2012) discusses commonly used options in assuring achievement including: overall results, external examiner syst ems, threshold standards and standardised testing, but stresses problems with each of these methods unless a moderation and calibration process is included. Yorke (2008) has also raised concern about adopting overall percentages as the indicator of quality as there is no agreement on how student performance should be graded, and no understanding of how grades are cumulated into an overall index of achievement (the Australian Vice - Chancellors Committee (2002) found thirteen different scales for reporting student overall achievement). This gives rise to question s about what a percentage or grade point average or degree classification actually tells us; which capabilities were actually assessed and at what level; and how grading was decided.

40|$|TBL is a {{distinctive}} educational approach {{that has been}} used across a range of curricula world-wide. Developed by Larry Michaelsen of the University of Central Missouri, TBL is a form of collaborative learning that uses a specific sequence of individual work, group work and immediate feedback. It has been shown to improve students’ engagement with course material, increase their capacity for problem-solving and develop their team working skills, all of which are essential in medical and healthcare education. Forget your previous experiences of group work or team working; TBL is very different! Students work in permanent teams with diverse resources and there are 3 main stages to TBL: 1. Pre-class Readiness: guided independent individual learning; students are given guidance as to what material they should study before coming to class. 2. In-class Readiness <b>Assurance</b> Process; students <b>undertake</b> a short test, based on the guided pre-class independent learning. This is a 2 -stage process, with a test being done by individual students, followed by the same test done by teams. A mini-lecture will follow, if need be 3. In-class Application Exercises; teams apply concepts they learned about to solve real-world problems. At key points during the module/unit, students are asked to evaluate the performance of their peers and provide them with constructive feedback. An evaluation of TBL at Durham University showed that TBL scores correlated highly with their examination scores. In addition, key message from students’ free text comments were: that TBL was well organised, that the application exercises allowed students to apply their learning to important aspects of medical practice, that feedback was received in a timely fashion, and that TBL had supported students' learning overall. This workshop will introduce participants to the TBL approach and provide them with opportunities to discuss TBL experiences with educators from three UK Universities...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In Vietnam, HIV testing {{services}} {{had been}} available only at provincial and district health facilities, {{but not at}} the primary health facilities. Consequently, access to HIV testing services had been limited especially in rural areas. In 2012, Vietnam piloted decentralization and integration of HIV services at commune health stations (CHSs). As a part of this pilot, a three-rapid test algorithm was introduced at CHSs. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the performance of a three-rapid test algorithm and the implementation of quality assurance measures to prevent misdiagnosis, at primary health facilities. Methods: The three-rapid test algorithm (Determine HIV- 1 / 2, followed by ACON HIV 1 / 2 and DoubleCheckGold HIV 1 & 2 in parallel) was piloted at CHSs from August 2012 to December 2013. Commune health staff were trained to perform HIV testing. Specimens from CHSs were sent to the provincial confirmatory laboratory (PCL) for confirmatory and validation testing. Quality <b>assurance</b> measures were <b>undertaken</b> including training, competency assessment, field technical assistance, supervision and monitoring and external quality assessment (EQA). Data on HIV testing were collected from the testing logbooks at commune and provincial facilities. Descriptive analysis was conducted. Sensitivity and specificity of the rapid testing algorithm were calculated. Results: A total of 1, 373 people received HIV testing and counselling (HTC) at CHSs. Eighty people were diagnosed with HIV infection (5. 8 %). The 755 / 1244 specimens reported as HIV negative at the CHS were sent to PCL and confirmed as negative, and all 80 specimens reported as HIV positive at CHS were confirmed as positive at the PCL. Forty-nine specimens that were reactive with Determine but negative with ACON and DoubleCheckGold at the CHSs were confirmed negative at the PCL. The results show this rapid test algorithm to be 100 % sensitive and 100 % specific. Of 21 CHSs that received two rounds of EQA panels, 20 CHSs submitted accurate results. Conclusions: Decentralization of HIV confirmatory testing to CHS is feasible in Vietnam. The results obtained from this pilot provided strong evidence of the feasibility of HIV testing at primary health facilities. Quality assurance measures including training, competency assessment, regular monitoring and supervision and an EQA scheme are essential for prevention of misdiagnosis...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The crCIHRt {{collaboration}} between Newfoundland and Ontario (2000 -present) is an interdisciplinary {{study of the}} determinants of and impact from colorectal cancer (CRC) between these two Canadian provinces. It includes {{an evaluation of the}} adjuvant treatment of CRC and overall survival from this common disease. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the adjuvant treatment of surgically curable (Stage I-III) colon cancer have not previously been evaluated in Canada. Canadian Cancer Statistics (CCS) have shown that overall survival from CRC is better in Ontario. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage I-III colon cancer in the two provinces is concordant with accepted CPGs and to contrast overall survival from colon cancer in comparison with data from CCS. [...] METHODS: In Newfoundland, all incident cases of colon cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000, ages 20 - 74 were included. In Ontario, all patients with a high- or intermediate-risk pedigree and a random sample of those with a low-risk pedigree for colon cancer, ages 18 - 74, diagnosed between January 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000 were offered participation in the study. Data was retrospectively retrieved using a standardized extraction form and quality <b>assurance</b> was <b>undertaken</b> through a random re-extraction by two physician researchers. The charts of all patients with stage II disease were qualitatively assessed to determine what factors were used to recommend chemotherapy to these patients. This was contrasted with CPGs recommending chemotherapy only in stage II patients with 'high-risk' features. An overall survival comparison between the two provinces was contrasted with age-standardized projections from CCS suggesting that Newfoundland experiences a worse overall survival than Ontario from CRC. [...] RESULTS: 173 / 274 (63 %) and 364 / 514 (71 %) eligible patients consented in Newfoundland and Ontario, respectively. [...] No one with stage I colon cancer in either province received adjuvant chemotherapy. 20 / 55 patients (36 %) in Newfoundland and 44 / 116 evaluable patients (38 %) in Ontario received adjuvant therapy for stage II disease. 18 / 41 patients (44 %) in Newfoundland and 30 / 53 patients (57 %) in Ontario with high-risk features received adjuvant treatment, significantly higher than patients without high-risk features. On multivariate analysis, age < 50 years was shown to be an independent predictor for the use of chemotherapy in stage II patients. 45 / 52 patients (87 %) in Newfoundland and 108 / 115 patients (94 %) in Ontario with stage III disease received adjuvant chemotherapy. [...] Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that overall 5 -year survival from colon cancer was significantly better in Ontario. Exclusion of patients consented by proxy in Newfoundland negated this survival advantage. [...] DISCUSSION: Concordance with CPGs for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer was not optimal. This may reflect selection bias of referring surgeons, a paucity of level I evidence and the belief that other factors such as age {{may play a role in}} predicting outcome. Ontario showed a significantly better overall survival, however, this advantage was lost when bias introduced through recruitment methods was controlled for. Methods to ensure consistency and appropriate resource allocation in the development, adaptation and implementation of CPGs and the importance of minimizing bias in survival analysis are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{reporting}} and sustainability assurance are new accounting technologies {{which have been}} introduced to assist organisations in transitioning to a sustainable growth model. The overarching research objective guiding {{this study is to}} understand how sustainability reporting managers (SRMs) prepare sustainability reports and how sustainability <b>assurance</b> providers (SAPs) <b>undertake</b> sustainability <b>assurance.</b> The study draws on Lawrence and Suddaby’s (2006) typology to understand the forms of institutional work SRMs and SAPs undertake as they perform their roles and how these efforts affect the institutionalisation of sustainability {{reporting and}} sustainability assurance. Given the interpretive nature of this research the tenants of hermeneutic theory are used to provide the research methodology and research method to guide the investigation. Data comprises of semi-structured interviews with SRMs and SAPs based in Australia and New Zealand. From the overarching research objective, three research questions are addressed. The first research question explores the supply-side of the sustainability assurance market. The institutional efforts of accounting sustainability assurance (ASAPs) are directed at institutionalising sustainability assurance as similar to or the same as a traditional financial statements audit. In comparison, the institutional efforts of non-accounting sustainability assurance providers (NASAPs) are directed towards institutionalising sustainability assurance as a vehicle designed to drive sustainability within reporting organisations. The second research question explores the institutional work of SRMs as they attempt to institutionalise sustainability reporting within their organisations. SRMs play the role of sustainability reporting champions and sustainability reporting experts. These efforts occur within the backdrop of the new GRI G 4 reporting guidelines. As a result, SRMs are changing the normative foundations underlying sustainability reporting from bigger is better to more focused materiality assessment driven reporting. However, while SRMs have been successful in embedding and routinising sustainability reporting these efforts have had a lesser immediate impact in promoting balanced sustainability reporting practices. The third research question focuses on the demand-side of the sustainability assurance market. Given the voluntary nature of sustainability assurance, SAPs institutional efforts are aimed at achieving the dual objectives of enhancing the credibility of sustainability reports and promoting the sustainability assurance as a value added service. However, due to the voluntary nature of sustainability assurance, the efforts of SAPs have had a relatively greater impact in promoting reliable sustainability reporting and less success in promoting balanced sustainability reporting. Finally, the efforts of SAPs in promoting sustainability assurance as a value added activity has also met with difficulties as this study finds that the engagement suffers from diminishing returns. The contributions from this study are both practical and academic. At a practical level, the findings will prove beneficial to inexperienced SRMs. The study recommends that given the voluntary nature of the engagement, {{there is a need for}} greater regulation designed to strengthen the position of SAPs. At an academic level, the findings build on the limited body of interpretive research examining the phenomena of sustainability reporting and sustainability assurance. Finally, the findings contribute to the literature on institutional work, building on Lawrence and Suddaby’s (2006) typology of forms of institutional work...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The health {{sector has}} ‘duty of care’ to provide {{comprehensive}} health services to survivors of violence, {{to act as}} a referral point, to collect and document evidence, to report data on violence and to engage in preventive services. In Malawi, 48 % of women experience some form of intimate partner violence (IPV) and a significant number report conditions requiring health care services, although few actually report to health services, which are in turn limited in scope and availability. Understanding how health care providers, relevant stakeholders and IPV survivors perceive the role of health care services in IPV is necessary to promote the development of context-relevant and sustainable health care interventions. AIM: To understand the health service responses to IPV in Malawi {{from a wide range of}} perspectives OBJECTIVES: i) to critically analyze written legislation, policy and strategy documents in relation to IPV and the health sector in Malawi; ii) to describe the perceptions and experiences of IPV and of health sector responses among survivors of violence, community members, health care workers and other key stakeholders in Malawi; iii) to estimate the extent of intimate partner and sexual violence from a health service uptake perspective using proxy determinants at one referral hospital in Malawi iv) To explore the policy implications of the study findings for the health sector responses in Malawi METHODS: In 2011, a multi-method situation analysis was conducted in three areas of Blantyre district, with additional data collected in Mangochi and Lilongwe districts. Seventeen relevant national documents were analyzed. A total of 10 focus group discussions (FGDs), 2 small groups and 14 individual interviews (IIs) were conducted with health care providers; 18 FGDs and one small group discussion were conducted with male and female, urban and rural community members; 12 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with survivors; 26 key informant interviews (KIIs) with donor agencies, GBV service providers, religious institutions; police officers and other stakeholders were conducted. A review of 3, 567 register records for the month of January 2011 was done in Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and police records on violence cases in Blantyre for the same month were reviewed. Qualitative data was analyzed using the ‘framework’ approach, assisted by NVIVO 9 software. Hospital records were analyzed using Epi Info™. Feminist approaches and the ecological framework for analysis of violence informed data analysis and interpretation. A range of quality <b>assurance</b> measures were <b>undertaken</b> and data were triangulated across all methods: policy analysis, interviews and records reviews. FINDINGS: A review of legislation and policy combined with qualitative stakeholder interviews revealed conflicts, gaps and lack of awareness of the available documents that undermined coordinated health sector responses. Survivors, community members and health care workers revealed that IPV is perceived as a massive, though under-recognised problem. IPV in its various forms was seen as widespread and normalised, except perhaps in the perceived severe forms (such as femicide and child rape). IPV, though considered as shameful, was not necessarily a very private matter with involvement of neighbours, families, friends and significant others. Various factors at individual, interpersonal, society and institutional levels were described as affecting under-reporting, access to services and responses from sources of support. The review of registered data confirmed that IPV is generally underreported in health services and that relying on trauma as a proxy for IPV against women would prove difficult to implement. This multi-method approach highlighted the importance of diagnostic identification and the difficulties of universal screening. The actual role of health services in IPV seemed fuzzy from the service user’s perspectives and narrowly confined to the bio-medical model or acute model of health service provision. However, both potential service users and health care providers were optimistic about new developments such as ‘One Stop Centres’ and about the potential role of health services, particularly those linked to HIV programmes. They suggested these be provided as a continuum from prevention to rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a range of laws and policies that define and promote action to prevent IPV in Malawi. These have had some positive influences on both community norms and health sector responses. However, ineffective promotion has limited their effectiveness. In addition there are gaps and inconsistencies that reduce their potential in guiding the health sector response to IPV. The study explored stakeholders’ perceptions of IPV, the health sector response and the factors shaping it. This revealed a complex web of interconnected socio-economic, cultural, political and institutional factors. Perceptions of violence are culturally normative and related to gender roles and expectations. The inclusion of male voices on IPV against men, and using emic definitions of violence revealed conflicts between women’s and men’s interpretations of IPV, particularly with regard to sexual violence and the transgression of gender and marital roles. The specific socio-economic and cultural context strongly favours a conflict resolution model of responding to violence, which raises questions about the mandate and the potential roles of the health sector. Most stakeholders perceive IPV as a significant problem and recognise multiple impacts on health. However there is a clear disconnect between the magnitude of the problem and the health sector response. Nevertheless, the health sector is well placed to play a leadership role and has some resources, such as HIV Testing and Counselling staff and curricula to offer in a multi-sectoral response. Proxy determinants as reflected in the health service registers proved to be inadequate due to poor reporting and recording, and under-reporting to health services. Under-reporting was influenced by a range of inter-connected barriers to formal help-seeking, including normative attitudes and ineffective responses by both informal and formal sources of support. However, knowledge was generated about the challenges to recording and reporting IPV in this setting. The study findings suggested a number of key opportunities for improving the health sector response to IPV in Malawi that may be appropriate in this specific context and considered their potential sustainability...|$|R
