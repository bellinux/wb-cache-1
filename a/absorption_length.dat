The positive-permittivity material, often called the dielectric material, can be any transparent material such as air or (for visible light) glass. The negative-permittivity material, often called the plasmonic material, may be a metal or other material. It is more critical, as it tends to have a large effect on the wavelength, <b>absorption</b> <b>length,</b> and other properties of the SPP. Some plasmonic materials are discussed next.|$|E

50|$|To {{protect the}} sensor from damages by short optical pulses, volume {{absorbers}} are used with <b>absorption</b> <b>lengths</b> {{in the order}} of millimetres. This enables volume absorbers to withstand higher pulse energy densities, since the optical power is absorbed over a considerable depth of material.|$|R
50|$|For surface {{absorbers}} {{the thickness}} of the absorption layer is very thin (0.1 - 100 µm) and so is the total <b>absorption</b> <b>length.</b> It is used for power measurements of lasers with long pulse length (generally for CW laser). If a laser with pulse length in the range of 10−7 - 10−4 sec is used the sensor can be damaged by either dielectric break-down or thermal effects. In case of thermal damage, heat is deposited in a short time and cannot be dissipated until the next pulse arrives. This leads to an accumulation of energy in a thin layer leading to partial vaporization. For dielectric breakdown, the peak energy density during a pulse is high enough to locally ionize the sensor surface.|$|E

This temperature increase {{results in a}} strain that can be estimated by multiplying it with the linear {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the film. Usually, a typical magnitude value of the acoustic pulse will be small, and for long propagation nonlinear effects could become important. But propagation of such short duration pulses will suffer acoustic attenuation if the temperature is not very low (Ref B). Thus, this method is most efficient with the utilization of surface acoustic waves, and studies on investigation of this method toward lateral structures are being conducted.|$|E

[...] FLARE initiators can ignite propellants through the release of plasma, or even through the use of ultraviolet heat radiation. [...] The <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> of a solid propellant is sufficient to be ignited by radiation from a plasma source. However, FLARE has most likely not reached optimal design requirements and further understanding of FLARE and how it works is completely necessary to ensure the evolution of the technology. If FLARE provided the XM-291 gun project with the sufficient radiative heat to ignite the propellant to achieve a muzzle energy of 17 MJ one could only imagine the possibilities with a fully developed FLARE plasma igniter. Current areas of study include how plasma will affect the propellant through radiation, the deliverance of mechanical energy and heat directly and by driving gas flow. Despite these daunting tasks FLARE has been seen as the most plausible igniter for future application on ETC guns.|$|E

30|$|The laser {{damage zone}} {{is defined by}} {{irreversible}} tissue damage due to laser irradiation (Bach et al. 2010). This damage zone is related but not identical to the <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> at the laser wavelength in water. At the Tm:YAG laser wavelength of 2013  nm, the <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> in water is 165  µm and approximately 426  µm at the Ho:YAG wavelength of 2123  nm (Irvine and Pollack 1968). Due to heat diffusion, the laser damage zone extends deeper into the irradiated tissue than the <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> (Herrmann et al. 2012). The experiments described above reveal a laser damage zone into porcine kidney by the Tm:YAG laser of 550 – 760  μm—depending on the ambient medium (aqueous saline solution or ambient air). The laser power delivered to tissue has less influence {{on the extent of}} the laser damage zone than the ambient medium (aqueous saline solution or ambient air). The laser damage zone by the Ho:YAG laser (450 – 714  μm) compares favorably to the Tm:YAG laser.

40|$|Eight {{production}} quality PbWO 4 crystals of CMS have been irradiated in a 20 GeV/c proton beam up to fluences of 5. 4 E 13 cm- 2. The damage recovery in these crystals has been followed {{for over a}} year. Comparative irradiations with 60 Co photons have been performed on seven other crystals using a dose rate of 1 kGy/h. In proton irradiated crystals the light transmission band-edge shifts and the induced <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> {{is proportional to the}} inverse of the 4 th power of the wavelength. In gamma-irradiated crystals the band-edge does not shift but formation of absorption bands is seen clearly. The <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> induced by gamma-radiation in crystals verified to have excellent radiation hardness, saturates at a level below 0. 5 m- 1. In the case of protons, we observe no correlation with the pre-characterised radiation hardness of the crystals and the induced absorption increases linearly with fluence. After a fluence of 5 E 13 cm- 2, an induced <b>absorption</b> <b>length</b> of approx. 15 m- 1 is seen with no sign of saturation. These observations provide strong evidence that high-energy protons create damage that cannot be reproduced with gamma-irradiation. However, these hadronic effects manifest themselves only at integral fluences well beyond 1 E 12 cm- 2 and most likely would escape undetected at lower fluences. A large fraction of the damage, both in proton- and gamma-irradiated crystals, is either stable or recovers very slowly. Comment: Submitted to Elsevier Science on November 23 rd, 200...|$|E
