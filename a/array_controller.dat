50|$|Within {{a storage}} network, {{encryption}} of data may occur at different hardware levels. <b>Array</b> <b>controller</b> based encryption describes the encryption of data occurring at the disk <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> before {{being sent to}} the disk drives. This article will provide an overview of different implementation techniques to <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> based encryption. For cryptographic and encryption theory, see disk encryption theory.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of an {{external}} <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> setup, the <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> would be an independent hardware module connected to the network. Within the hardware <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> would be an Encryption unit for data encryption as well as a Key Management Client for authentication. Generally, there are few hardware array controllers to many host devices and storage disks. Therefore, it reduces deployment complexity to implement into fewer hardware components. Moreover, the lifecycle of an <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> is generally much longer than host computers and storage disks, therefore the encryption implementation will not need to be reimplemented as often as if encryption was done at another point in the storage network.|$|E

Logical volumes that are mirrored have higher availability when mirrored across separate disk <b>array</b> <b>controllers.</b> Mirroring logical volumes across separate disk <b>array</b> <b>controllers</b> allows the logical volumes to continue to operate should one disk array fail.|$|R

50|$|For the {{software}} <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> encryption, a software <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> driver directs data into individual host bus adapters. In the diagram on the right, {{there are multiple}} host bus adapters with hardware encryption units used for better performance requirements. In contrast, this type of encryption can be implemented with only 1 host bus adapter connected to a network of multiple hard drives and would still function. Performance will definitely be reduced since there will only be one encryption unit processing data. Key management will be done much like the internal <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> encryption mentioned before with the Key Management Client implemented as a service within the Host Computer.|$|E

50|$|Zoning is {{sometimes}} confused with LUN masking, because it serves the same goals. LUN masking, however, works on Fibre channel level 4 (i.e. on SCSI level), while zoning works on level 2. This allows zoning {{to be implemented}} on switches, whereas LUN masking is performed on endpoint devices - host adapters or disk <b>array</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the drive}} itself is {{inherently}} reliable but has some bad sectors, then TLER and similar features prevent a disk from being unnecessarily marked as 'failed' {{by limiting the}} time spent on correcting detected errors before advising the <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> of a failed operation. The <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> can then handle the data recovery for the limited amount involved, rather than marking the entire drive as faulty.|$|E
50|$|For an {{internal}} <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> configuration, the <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> is generally a PCI bus card situated inside the host computer. As {{shown in the}} diagram, the PCI <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> would contain an encryption unit where plaintext data is encrypted into ciphertext. This separate encryption unit is utilized to prevent and minimize performance reduction and maintain data throughput. Furthermore, the Key Management Client will generally be an additional service within the host computer applications where it will authenticate all keys retrieved from the Key Server. A major disadvantage {{to this type of}} implementation would be that encryption components are required to be integrated within each host computer and therefore is redundant on large networks with many host devices.|$|E

5000|$|Server-grade disk <b>array</b> <b>controllers</b> often contain onboard disk buffer, {{and provide}} an option for a [...] "backup battery unit" [...] (BBU) to {{maintain}} the contents of this cache after power loss.

50|$|SANs {{also tend}} to enable more {{effective}} disaster recovery processes. A SAN could span a distant location containing a secondary storage array. This enables storage replication either implemented by disk <b>array</b> <b>controllers,</b> by server software, or by specialized SAN devices. Since IP WANs are often the least costly method of long-distance transport, the Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) and iSCSI protocols {{have been developed to}} allow SAN extension over IP networks. The traditional physical SCSI layer could support only a few meters of distance - not nearly enough to ensure business continuance in a disaster.|$|R

FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, {{and it is the}} cornerstone of storage area networks (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like iSCSI and ATA over Ethernet have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use copper twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics.

50|$|A simple disk <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> may {{fit inside}} a computer, {{either as a}} PCI {{expansion}} card or just built onto a motherboard.

50|$|A disk <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> is {{a device}} which manages the {{physical}} disk drives and presents {{them to the}} computer as logical units.

5000|$|The {{encryption}} of {{data can}} take place in many points in a storage network. The point of encryption may occur on the host computer, in the SAN infrastructure, the <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> or {{on each of the}} hard disks as shown on the diagram above. Each point of encryption has different merits and costs. Within the diagram, the key server components are also shown for each configuration of encryption. Designers of SANs and SAN components must take into consideration factors such as performance, deployment complexity, key server interoperability, strength of security, and cost when choosing where to implement encryption. But since the <b>array</b> <b>controller</b> is a natural central point of all data therefore encryption at this level is inherent and also reduces deployment complexity.|$|E

The FlashSystem design omits traditional server-based <b>array</b> <b>controllers.</b> The primary components of each FlashSystem unit include custom flash modules, external storage area network interfaces, and FPGA logic that spreads data through the system. Each flash module within a FlashSystem incorporates enterprise multi-level cell or single-level cell flash chips and FPGAs that provide IBM Variable Stripe RAID data protection as well as standard flash memory controller functions. IBM claims that these architectural attributes provide strong performance, reliability, and efficiency. In August 2013, IBM submitted a single FlashSystem 820 SPC-1 benchmark result to the Storage Performance Council that showed fast response time (SPC-1 LRT) and high SPC-1 IOPS per external storage port - common measures of high storage performance - as well as low power consumption.|$|R
