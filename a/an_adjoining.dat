5|$|How Robertet {{obtained}} {{such a large}} plot in {{the centre}} of Blois is unknown; he may have acquired the land gradually for the building's future construction, or could have been granted a fief by the Crown for his services. Although, {{it is known that}} Robertet sought to acquire <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> building (the Hôtel Denis-Dupont) to extend his property. Lawyer Denis Dupont (the building's owner) strongly opposed the idea, and over half of the former Hôtel Denis-Dupont remains.|$|E

In 1950 the congregation built <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> school; {{at its peak}} its enrollment was almost 1,000. As neighborhood demographics changed in the late 20th century, and Brooklyn's Jewish population became more Orthodox, the East Midwood Jewish Center absorbed three other Conservative Brooklyn congregations.|$|E

5|$|The O'Brien Brewing and Malting Company, {{also known}} as the Klondike Brewery, was a brewery founded by Thomas O'Brien in Klondike City, <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> {{settlement}} to Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada from 1904 to 1919. It was established during a period in which Dawson City was expected to become an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of beer in 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation.|$|E
5|$|The choir has broad arches {{with two}} wave {{mouldings}} carried down the piers which support the ribs of the vaulting. These {{may have been}} designed by Thomas Witney or William Joy as they {{are similar to the}} work at Wells Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe. The choir is separated from the eastern Lady Chapel by a 14th-century reredos which was damaged in The reformation and repaired in 1839 when the 17th-century altarpiece was removed. The Lady Chapel was brightly painted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries following existing fragments of colour. To the south east of the choir and Lady Chapel is the Berkeley Chapel and <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> antechapel or sacristy, which may have been added in the 14th century, possibly replacing an earlier structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{second of}} these {{buildings}} is a terraced, three-bay, three-storey house with <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> four-bay, two-storey coach house, which still has its original limestone carriage arch. It {{has been used}} as a hotel since the early 19th century and was home to Anthony Trollope during his stay in Banagher in the 1840s. It has a prominent location next to the marina and close to the bridge. Long called The Shannon Hotel, the name was changed to The Royal Shannon in the 1990s. It has ceased to trade as a hotel and is now falling into neglect.|$|E
5|$|With {{the skin}} {{no larger than}} a {{periwinkle}} leaf, he is visited by Pauline in his room; she expresses her love for him. When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the tollhouse was proving {{inadequate}} as {{the seat}} of local government and between 1407 and 1413 it was demolished, along with <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> site which had housed a vegetable market, {{and was replaced by}} a new Guildhall. In keeping with Norwich's status, {{it was one of the}} largest civic buildings in England outside London and housed all aspects of local government and justice for the new council. The Guildhall cost between £400–£500 to build. (As it was built primarily using pressed labour, modern equivalents of the building costs are virtually meaningless. The annual income of the city council at the time the Guildhall was built was around £120.) The eastern face of the Guildhall was built in a distinctive black and white checked design, representing the exchequer. The undercroft of the tollhouse was retained for use as a dungeon, while a new basement served as a lock-up from the opening of the Guildhall until the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had <b>an</b> <b>adjoining</b> principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E
5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in Victorian style, in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. <b>An</b> <b>adjoining</b> single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E
50|$|A posad (посад) was a {{settlement}} in the Russian Empire, often surrounded by ramparts and <b>a</b> moat, <b>adjoining</b> <b>a</b> town or a kremlin, but outside of it, or <b>adjoining</b> <b>a</b> monastery in the 10th to 15th centuries. The posad was inhabited by craftsmen and merchants and was its own distinct community, separate from the city it adjoined. Some posads developed into towns, such as Pavlovsky Posad and Sergiev Posad.|$|R
