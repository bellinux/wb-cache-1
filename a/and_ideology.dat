5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history rests on his {{being one of the}} first {{in a long line of}} actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste <b>and</b> <b>ideology,</b> and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.|$|E
5|$|John treated his {{children}} equally within the home. He educated them {{in politics and}} social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors. John's political work <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> had a strong influence on Josephine, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and a staunch religious faith.|$|E
5000|$|Although [...] "productivism" [...] can be {{considered}} pejorative, as it is unacceptable to many individuals <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> that it describes, these same individuals <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> often use phrases like [...] "productivity", [...] "growth", [...] "economic sense", and [...] "common sense" [...] without argument, presupposing the primacy of industry.|$|R

5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national ideology during the Meiji period starting in 1868. It {{is often described as}} any state-supported, Shinto-inspired ideology or practice intended to inspire national integration, unity, and loyalty. State Shinto is also understood to refer to the state rituals <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> of Emperor-worship, which was not a traditional emphasis of Shinto — of the 124 Japanese emperors, only 20 have dedicated shrines.|$|E
5|$|Hilary Minc, {{the third}} in command in Bolesław Bierut's {{political}} triumvirate of Stalinist leaders, became the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Industry, Industry and Commerce, and the Economic Affairs. He was personally assigned by Stalin first to Industry and than to Transportation ministries of Poland. His wife, Julia, became the Editor-in-Chief of the monopolized Polish Press Agency. Minister Jakub Berman – Stalin's right hand in Poland until 1953 – held the Political propaganda <b>and</b> <b>Ideology</b> portfolios. He {{was responsible for the}} largest and most notorious secret police {{in the history of the}} People's Republic of Poland, the Ministry of Public Security (UB), employing 33,200 permanent security officers, one for every 800 Polish citizens.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{served on}} the Court for nearly thirty years, during which time he espoused a {{conservative}} jurisprudence <b>and</b> <b>ideology,</b> advocating textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation. He was a strong defender of {{the powers of the}} executive branch, believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas. He supported the death penalty and opposed abortion, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, as well as most policies that afforded equal or special status to minority groups, earning {{a reputation as one of}} the most conservative justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court's majority using scathing language.|$|E

5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Epitome de Caesaribus offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E
5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both style <b>and</b> <b>ideology.</b> Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E
