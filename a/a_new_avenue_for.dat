25|$|By invading Switzerland, the French {{government}} had unwittingly opened up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> the Coalition forces to invade France. Along its borders with Belgium and Germany, France was well-protected by a belt of fortresses. But in the Jura Mountains on the Swiss frontier, {{there were only}} a few places like Fort de Joux and Salins-les-Bains guarding the region of Franche-Comté. Lazare Carnot regretfully noted that when Switzerland was neutral, France could ignore their common border. However, with Switzerland a belligerent, the French must deploy 40,000 soldiers to either occupy the country or watch the frontier.|$|E
2500|$|The Cossack hetman and his {{advisers}} meant a military alliance to facilitate common fight against Poland, even {{at the price of}} losing some of the sovereignty acquired in recent years; to Russia <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> imperial expansion was opened. The Treaty of Pereyaslav, an act of [...] "unification of Ukraine with Russia", was from the Commonwealth's point of view an instance of rebellion combined with foreign meddling. It led to a new Russo-Polish war that lasted from 1654 to 1667. Powerful Russian armies entered the Commonwealth and the conflict with the Cossacks became a war with the Tsardom.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are pluripotent. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if reprogramming to pluripotency was [...] "complete"). Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient. In fact, frozen blood samples {{can be used as a}} source of induced {{pluripotent stem cells}}, opening <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> obtaining the valued cells. Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection. Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in medical treatment and research.|$|E

2500|$|The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine {{was awarded}} in 1901 to the German {{physiologist}} Emil Adolf von Behring.

In 1902, the award went to Ronald Ross for his work on malaria, [...] "by which he has shown how it enters the organism and thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it". He identified the mosquito as the transmitter of malaria, and worked tirelessly on measures to prevent malaria worldwide. The 1903 prize was awarded to Niels Ryberg Finsen, the first Danish laureate, [...] "in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially lupus vulgaris, with concentrated light radiation, whereby he has opened <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> medical science".

40|$|Description This package {{estimates}} {{factor analysis}} models using a genetic algorithm, which permits a general mechanism for restricted optimization with arbitrary restrictions that are chosen at run {{time with the}} help of a GUI. Importantly,inequality restrictions can be imposed on functions of multiple parameters, which provides <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenues</b> <b>for</b> testing and generating theories with factor analysis models. This package also includes <b>an</b> entirely <b>new</b> estimator of the common factor analysis model called semi-exploratory factor analysis, which is a general alternative to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, this package integrates a lot of other packages that estimate sample covariance matrices and thus provides a lot of alternatives to the traditional sample covariance calculation.

40|$|Abstract—The ordered {{weighted}} ` 1 norm (OWL) {{was recently}} proposed, with two different motivations: {{because of its}} good statistical properties as a sparsity promoting regularizer, and as generalization of the so-called octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for regression (OSCAR). The OSCAR is a convex group-sparsity inducing regularizer, which {{does not require the}} prior specification of the group structure. Also recently, much interest has been raised by the atomic norm formulation of several regularizers, not only because it provides <b>an</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> their theoretical characterization, but also because it is particularly well suited to a type of method known as conditional gradient (CG), or Frank-Wolfe, algorithm. In this paper, we derive the atomic formulation of the OWL and exploit this formulation to show how Tikhonov regularization schemes can be handled using state-of-the-art proximal splitting algorithms, while Ivanov regularization can be efficiently implemented via the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
