40|$|Due {{to global}} {{conditions}} {{there is a}} demand for more economically and ecologically driven ships. The development of <b>autopilots</b> with optimization criterions on essential parameters will therefore be an important research field in the future.

5|$|President Reagan {{announced}} on September 16, 1983, that the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{would be made}} available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in the future. Furthermore, the interface of the <b>autopilot</b> used on large airliners was modified {{to make it more}} obvious whether it is operating in HEADING mode or INS mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} <b>autopilot</b> modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the <b>autopilot.</b> Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ship <b>autopilots</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} based on PID controller {{because of the}} simplicity and the ease of construct. However its performance in various environmental conditions {{is not as good}} as desired. This disadvantage can be decreased by designing a linear state space feedback controller. This paper presents the utility of the state-space feedback controller to stabilize the system and shaping its response as desired. The simulation results for a 4 DOF ship with real parameters show the effectiveness of the feedback controller in comparison with ordinary PID ship <b>autopilots...</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>autopilot</b> {{had been}} used since 25 seconds after {{take-off}} from Namsos and {{was used for the}} remainder of the flight. From 20:29:21 all four engines showed increasing torque and immediately before the crash the aircraft had shifted its angle from −2.5degrees to 5degrees. At 20:29:29 the ground proximity warning system showed 'minimum'. The aircraft crashed into the western side Torghatten at 20:29:30 at 170meters (560ft) elevation.|$|E
5|$|The hijackers {{stormed the}} aircraft's cockpit {{approximately}} 46 minutes after takeoff.

However, Ziad Jarrah, who had {{trained as a}} pilot, {{took control of the}} aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh have claimed that the intended target was the Capitol Building.|$|E
