She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer.

500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> would be the easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) Gardner {{states that he}} first heard the term Wica while being {{initiated}} into the New Forest coven in September 1939, stating that [...] "I realised I had stumbled on something interesting; but I was half-initiated before the word Wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt, and I knew where I was, and that the Old Religion still existed." [...] This account was repeated in his biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960), written by Idries Shah but attributed to Jack L. Bracelin, {{in which he is}} quoted as saying that [...] "it was halfway through when the word Wica was first mentioned; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] If Gardner's account was accurate and the New Forest coven had really existed, then the fact that Gardner spelled the word as Wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way. As he relates, from Gardner's account, [...] "it seems that he had heard rather than read the word {{in the midst of his}} initiatory rite" [...] and that, [...] "suffering from a poor grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, something caused by the fact that he was self-educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia", he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as Wica.|$|E

With the way I sang it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take.

[...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened.

If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that.</b> I'm completely open to having that conversation.

2500|$|Seamus McGarvey {{served as}} the film's cinematographer, {{shooting}} the film digitally using Arri Alexa cameras with Panavision C-Series anamorphic lenses. Sequences of the film set in the year 1954 were shot using vintage lenses from the early 1960s {{in order to give}} the film a [...] "distant period feel." [...] This effect was enhanced though the digital intermediate's colour grading, as McGarvey noted that the [...] "look I wanted was a peeled look with muted colors and diffusion on the highlights, a sense of period distance. I found a lot of photographs and magazines, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I wanted the blacks to be imbued with a tint of magenta." [...] Though the film was made to be released in 3D, it received a predominantly 2D release. McGarvey himself decided to shoot the film as if it were only 2D, because he dislikes working with 3D filming equipment and the experience of watching 3D films in theatres.|$|E
2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E
