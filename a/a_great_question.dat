25|$|The {{independence}} of India and Pakistan from British rule bore more {{importance for the}} people of then Bengal. Since then the Bengali speaking community were divided into two parts – the East and the West Bengal. It turns into the smashing of the millennium-old culture and unity of Bengali nation. Moreover, the existence of language became <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>question</b> just after the creation of Pakistan. The West-Pakistan ruling government tried to impose Urdu as the principal language on the Bengali people. But the whole society reacted strongly. This leaves a permanent impression on Bengali literature. In this tumultuous era, Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (1948) was published. It was the foremost successful novel, both from art and reality points of view. Later Syed Waliullah translated it in English by the name Tree Without Roots. Mahbub-ul Alam wrote Mofijon, also published in 1948.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{suggested}} that the film draws upon many existing religious and mythological motifs. [...] Vern Barnet of the Charlotte Observer opined that Avatar poses <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>question</b> of faith—should the creation be seen and governed hierarchically, from above, or ecologically, through mutual interdependence? He {{also noted that the}} film borrows concepts from other religions and compared its Tree of Souls with the Norse story of the tree Yggdrasil, also called axis mundi or the center of the world, whose destruction signals the collapse of the universe. [...] Malinda Liu in Newsweek likened the Na'vi respect for life and belief in reincarnation with Tibetan religious beliefs and practices, but Reihan Salam of Forbes called the species [...] "perhaps the most sanctimonious humanoids ever portrayed on film." ...|$|E

He then asks, [...] "Miss 3rd Ward, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?", [...] to which Beyoncé replies: [...] "Oh, my aspiration in life? That's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>question.</b> I wasn't expecting that question". During her reply, her voice is echoed repeating the question, and she is then pictured drowning in water and looking unhappy backstage. After the pause, Beyoncé answers, [...] "My aspiration in life would be to be happy". The chorus then restarts with Beyoncé wrecking a shelf containing her personal trophies. She is also shown backstage, smearing her make-up, and vomiting in the bathroom. Another contestant is pictured eating cotton.|$|E

2500|$|Augustine of Hippo wrote {{two books}} about lying: On Lying (De Mendacio) and Against Lying (Contra Mendacio). He {{describes}} each book {{in his later}} work, Retractions. Based on the location of De Mendacio in Retractions, {{it appears to have}} been written about 395AD. The first work, On Lying, begins: [...] "Magna quæstio est de Mendacio" [...] ("There is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>question</b> about Lying"). From his text, it can be derived that St. Augustine divided lies into eight categories, listed in order of descending severity: ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 1890 Caine {{published}} a magazine serial called Drink: A Love Story on <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Question.</b> This {{was about the}} same time as Bram Stoker began his notes for his Dracula novel. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in mesmerism. Drink contains a number of similarities to Stoker’s novel. [...] In 1906 Drink was published by George Newnes, and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter Cyrus Cuneo. It was described in the Manchester Guardian as ‘a rather gruesome love story’. The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence. Two hundred thousand copies of the book had been sold in England by the time the American edition was published by Appleton in 1907.|$|E

6000|$|It did fit him indeed; and of {{the male}} costumes it was that on which Somerset had {{bestowed}} most pains when designing them. It shrewdly burst upon his mind that {{there might have been}} collusion between Mild and De Stancy, the former agreeing to take the captain's place and act as blind till the last moment. <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> <b>question</b> was, could Paula have been aware of this, and would she perform as the Princess of France now De Stancy was to be her lover? ...|$|R
