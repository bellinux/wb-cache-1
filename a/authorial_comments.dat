50|$|Jane Austen's <b>authorial</b> <b>comments</b> on Mr Woodhouse {{are very}} muted: {{for the most}} part he is {{presented}} in dialogue, where his eccentricities have the best chance to shine. He is introduced by her as “a nervous man, easily depressed...hating change of any kind”, while a late vignette shows him under the weather, when “he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side”. In between, Austen quietly observes his “gentle selfishness” and his “mild inexorability”. Those who see him as a confirmed egotist, who uses his wealth to make the world revolve around himself - “unfit for any acquaintance, but such as would visit him on his own terms”; and hypocritically imperious with his servants - can certainly find evidence in the text to support their views; but the overall impression of a lovable charmer still remains.|$|E

40|$|In manga studies, a {{distinction}} is made between linguistic text (language) and visual language. However, because linguistic text is mediated by visual structures, {{there is a}} a tendency to assume {{that it is a}} secondary element. I would argue, however, that examination of both languages might give a better idea of how manga functions, and start that process here by looking at two manga text types: handwritten lines, thoughts and <b>authorial</b> <b>comments.</b> Visually differentiated from other texts, and more common in series for girls (shōjo-manga), I compare them with Ōtsuka's (1994) highly-visual monologues from 1970 s/ 1980 s shōjo-manga, and demonstrate similarities to Takeuchi's (2005) mediator and spectator characters, and argue that these texts offer a sense of closeness to authors while also visually-coding data in terms of relevance. While non-essential secondary text, their visual-encoding offers a space of dynamic interpretation, with readerships able to ignore or read them as per their needs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some distinctive {{aspects of}} the written news-interview as {{it is commonly used}} (and overused) in Italian weeklies and newspapers. As a textual genre, a written interview shows an interesting reworking from an original spoken mode to a written mode that must still keep a ‘flavour’ of oral speech. All the structural and discursive changes that this type of reconstructed text requires are hardly compatible with the use of direct speech, as a verbatim mode of reporting. Nevertheless, the Italian written news-interview is usually rendered as a clear-cut succession of questions and answers reported through direct speech, no matter how many linguistic and textual changes have been carried out as a whole on the original spoken text. The Italian usage thus offers a striking contrast with different journalistic traditions, where the interpretative side of reporting is usually performed by journalists through the use of indirect speech or through explicit <b>authorial</b> <b>comments,</b> and where direct speech always implies a verbatim rendition of the news-maker’s original words...|$|E
50|$|Marius the Epicurean: his sensations {{and ideas}} is a {{historical}} and philosophical novel by Walter Pater (his only completed full-length fiction), written between 1881 and 1884, published in 1885 and set in 161-177 AD, in the Rome of the Antonines. It explores the intellectual development of its protagonist, a young Roman of integrity, in his pursuit of a congenial religion or philosophy {{at a time of}} change and uncertainty that Pater likened to his own era. The narration is third-person, slanted from Marius's point of view, added to which are various interpolated discourses, ranging from adaptations of classical and early Christian writings to Marius’s diary and <b>authorial</b> <b>comment.</b>|$|R
50|$|His {{anonymous}} The Female Husband (1746) is a fictionalized {{account of}} a notorious {{case in which a}} female transvestite was tried for duping another woman into marriage; this was {{one of a number of}} small pamphlets, and cost sixpence at the time. Though a minor item in Fielding's œuvre, the subject is consistent with his ongoing preoccupation with fraud, shamming and masks. His greatest work was Tom Jones (1749), a meticulously constructed picaresque novel telling the convoluted and hilarious tale of how a foundling came into a fortune. The plot of Tom Jones is too ingeniously complicated for simple summary; its basis is Tom's alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. The triumph of the book is its presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented, and through them every shade of moral behavior. Fielding's varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel, and his <b>authorial</b> <b>comment</b> preceding each chapter adds a significant dimension to the conventionally straightforward narrative.|$|R

[...] Thompson claims that series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Sopranos, and The Simpsons [...] "...have altered long-standing notions of closure and single authorship", which means that [...] "...television has wrought its own changes in traditional narrative form."

[...] An art film is typically a serious, noncommercial, independently made film that is aimed at a niche audience, rather than a mass audience. Film critics and film studies scholars typically define an “art film” using a “...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films.” ...|$|R
40|$|Songs play a {{vital role}} in the {{everyday}} life of the AmaXhosa. Each and every occasion or gathering is accompanied by singing. Their anger or pain, sorrow or joy is reflected in their singing. Although these songs are composed for social purposes and entertainment, they are also educational. Songs may be composed and sung to comment on political affairs, complain against the abuse of power by the authorities, declare war, protest, praise a hero, encourage working together and ridicule the foolishness of someone. Vocabulary and diction used in the composition of these songs, relays the message in a clever and witty style. Since the AmaXhosa are intellectuals, irony and satire are used. The satirical or ironical songs hide the meaning and the listener must unravel the real meaning. AmaXhosa singing, chanting and dancing is accompanied by instruments. These instruments add more rhythm to the dance. The AmaXhosa use anything at their disposal when carving their instruments. Their songs may be accompanied by the beating of cow-hide drums, blowing of reed-pipe whistles, animal horns, beating of sticks and hand-clapping. The most important instrument the AmaXhosa use is the human voice. They are experts in humming, gruff singing and whistling. The songs of the AmaXhosa encourage togetherness. When one composes a song, one does not express one’s own feelings, but also the feelings of the community. The AmaXhosa songs are about participation so group singing and dancing is encouraged. Everyone participates either by singing, dancing or clapping. x Respect is the central core of the AmaXhosa songs. That is why the songs are composed according to age groups and sex. Instruments are also used according to ages and sex. Written texts are also a tool to educate the reader. The writers have decided to include songs in their writings to act as a form of entertainment and education. Although some songs lack the hallmarks of a traditional song, they communicate the idea or relay the message the writer wants to convey to the reader.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} conceptions of {{teaching}} and learning held by a small group of students completing a one year course in secondary teacher education at the Christchurch College of Education. Seven students were interviewed, observed and surveyed over a period of eight months, to track the development in their conceptions and the factors impacting on this development. The phenomenographic interview formed the primary means of data collection. Conceptions emerging from the data were categorised in terms of their fundamental differences. Findings are presented in two parts. Firstly a profile of each student is constructed from the data gathered; each profile concludes with a brief <b>authorial</b> <b>comment.</b> Secondly, conceptions {{of teaching and}} learning are categorised and compared with existing categories of conceptions. While the students' conceptions of learning are found to correspond closely to existing categories, different categories of conceptions of teaching have been identified. A model of conceptions of teaching is presented in which the categories are considered to be complementary rather than hierarchical. This thesis suggests that there is a close link between students' conceptions of learning and their approaches to teaching; that prior educational experiences, especially the influence of significant teachers, has a strong and lasting impact on students' ideas about teaching and learning; that these ideas undergo modification rather than substantial change as a result of pre-service teacher education; that time constraints and the teaching approaches of some associate teachers in schools may encourage students to adopt teaching methods which encourage surface approaches to learning in their pupils; and that effective teaching should draw on all three categories of conceptions of teaching presented in the model...|$|R
