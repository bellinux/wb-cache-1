5|$|Apart from {{changes in}} the legal {{specifications}} of the shades of the national colors (see the section below), the basic design of the Polish flag, including the 5:8 ratio, has remained unchanged to this day.

Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. In that period, Poland {{was one of the few}} socialist states in the Eastern Bloc (apart from the Flag of Cuba) not to adorn communist symbolism on its flag.|$|E
