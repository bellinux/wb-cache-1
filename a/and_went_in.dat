Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles. After the second Manchester League win, Leek joined the Cheshire County League, where they were league champions at the second attempt in the 1974–75 season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria a series of managers came <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> quick succession {{without being able to}} maintain this level of success.|$|E

25|$|A {{specialist}} batsman {{who played}} for Canterbury <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> late in the order, Powell established a New Zealand seventh-wicket record in 1930 that still stands. Canterbury and Otago went into their {{final game of the}} 1929–30 Plunket Shield season at Lancaster Park, Christchurch, equal {{at the bottom of the}} table with no victories, so the match would decide who finished last. Otago batted first and made 172 off 71.2 overs. Canterbury replied more positively and were 226 for 5 when stumps were drawn at the fall of the fifth wicket.|$|E
25|$|The next 14 overs saw slower scoring, as de Villiers and Gibbs put on 44, before Gibbs inside edged for 21. It was Gibbs' fifth innings {{at number}} {{three in the}} order, and he has still not passed 50 at this position.

25|$|In May 1944, Gable was {{promoted}} to major. He hoped for another combat assignment, but when the invasion of Normandy came <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> June without any further orders, Gable was relieved from active duty as a major on June 12, 1944, at his request, since he was over-age for combat. His discharge papers were signed by Captain (later U.S. President) Ronald Reagan. Gable completed editing of the film Combat America in September 1944, giving the narration himself and making use of numerous interviews with enlisted gunners as focus of the film. Because his motion picture production schedule {{made it impossible for}} him to fulfill reserve officer duties, he resigned his commission on September 26, 1947, a week after the Air Force became an independent service branch.|$|E

25|$|The legend {{associated}} with the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais {{is part of the}} same story that surrounds the naming of the nearby Gulf of Corryvreckan (English: the speckled cauldron). This is where the Norse Prince Breacan of Lochlann is said to have drowned when his boat sank there, so giving his name to this great whirlpool. The prince's dog managed to swim to land <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> search of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed his footing on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits {{in the middle of the}} channel between the two islands. He slipped into the raging current and drowned as well, giving his own name in turn to the strait where he fell - the 'pass of the grey dog'.|$|E
25|$|Lundqvist's {{performance}} in the 2014–15 season was also stellar. However, in a game on January 31, 2015 against the Carolina Hurricanes, Lundqvist took a shot to his neck from Brad Malone. He stayed in net for the game, which the Rangers won 4-2, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> net for another game on February 2, a 6-3 win over the Florida Panthers, before {{it was discovered that}} a blood vessel in Lundqvist's neck was damaged, and that Lundqvist would be out for 5–7 weeks as a result. Despite the superior performance of backup goaltender Cam Talbot during Lundqvist's absence, Lundqvist would remain the Rangers' starter upon his return on March 28, in a 4-2 loss to the Boston Bruins. Despite missing nearly 2 months, Lundqvist was able to clinch 30 wins for the 9th time in his career, going 5-2-0 after returning from the injury.|$|E

He lived for some years on the Continent <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> 1832 to Egypt and Nubia, travelling mostly on foot. The results of his journey were published under the titles Egypt and Mohammed Ali, or Travels in the Valley of the Nile (2 vols., 1834), Egypt and Nubia (1844), and Isis, an Egyptian Pilgrimage (2 vols., 1853). On his return he settled in London, and for many years wrote political leaders for the Daily Telegraph and, under the pseudonym of Greville Booke, a column in the Sunday Times. In 1868 he published a Life of Sir Walter Raleigh, based on researches in the archives at Madrid and elsewhere. He died in London in 1875.|$|E

25|$|On April 20, the MLS Disciplinary Committee {{suddenly}} {{announced that}} they would suspend manager Ben Olsen and fine him $500 for stepping onto the field during the Toronto match. With Chad Ashton as their acting manager, D.C. bounced back in their very next match with a 3-0 victory against New England. Neagle opened the scoring for D.C. and Saborio closed it out with another late insurance goal, but the most memorable moment of the game came when Lucho Acosta scored a fabulous goal—a long distance chip over the goalie that struck {{the bottom of the}} crossbar <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> the net for Acosta's first goal in a D.C. United uniform. The goal also earned Acosta the MLS Goal of the Week honor. United closed out the month on the road against the Chicago Fire.

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|In 1858, the Japanese {{government}} {{lifted the}} banishment of Siebold. He returned to Japan in 1859 {{as an adviser}} to the Agent of the Dutch Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij) in Nagasaki, Albert Bauduin. After two years the connection with the Trading Society was severed as the advice of Siebold was of no value. In Nagasaki he fathered another child with one of his female servants. In 1861 Siebold organised his appointment {{as an adviser to}} the Japanese government <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> that function to Edo. There he tried to obtain a position between the foreign representatives and the Japanese government. As he had been specially admonished by the Dutch authorities before going to Japan that he was to abstain from all interference in politics, the Dutch Consul General in Japan, J.K. de Wit, was ordered to ask Siebold's removal. Siebold was ordered to return to Batavia and from there he returned to Europe. After his return he asked the Dutch government to employ him as Consul General in Japan but the Dutch government severed all relations with Siebold who had a huge debt because of loans given to him, except for the payment of his pension.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the second half had the Badgers {{starting}} at their own 20-yard line. On the first play, Badgers RB Melvin Gordon lined up as a wide receiver <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> motion taking the jet sweep handoff 80-yards for a touchdown. This gave the Badgers a 21–13 lead. Arizona State the scored {{before the end of the}} third quarter on a Marion Grice 1-yard touchdown run but the 2-point attempt failed. On the next drive, Wisconsin extended their lead 24–19 with a 34-yard field goal by K Kyle French. Arizona State took the lead less than two minutes later on a Marion Grice 2-yard touchdown run but again failed on the 2-point try giving the Sun Devils a 25–24 lead. After a Badgers punt, the Sun Devils added to their lead with a 12-yard touchdown run by Marion Grice, his fourth touchdown of the night. Arizona State led 32–24 with 8:50 left to go in the game. The Badgers scored on their next drive chewing up over five minutes as Melvin Gordon scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Badgers attempted the 2-point conversion to try and tie the game but Joel Stave's pass was incomplete as the Sun Devils held on to a 32–30 lead with less than for minutes remaining in the game. Arizona State could not run out the clock as they got to about midfield where they were forced to punt. Wisconsin got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with 1:36 and the Badgers were out of timeouts. On third and four at their own 23-yard line, Joel Stave connected with WR Jeff Duckworth for a 51-yard catch and run that put the Badgers at the Sun Devils 26-yard line.|$|E
25|$|Large {{partnerships}} do {{more than}} simply add runs to the scoreboard, they may also serve to exhaust and demoralise the fielding team. Both of these were major factors at the famous Test match at Eden Gardens in 2001, when India's V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid put on a fifth wicket stand of 376 runs, staying at the crease for the entire fourth day's play without being dismissed. Despite having forced their opponents to follow on, Steve Waugh's highly regarded Australians were left emotionally and physically drained, slumping to a shock heavy (171 run) defeat. Even if nowhere near as damaging numerically, larger-than-expected last wicket stands can still be very demoralising, especially because {{as soon as the}} Number 11 batsman walks out of the pavilion, many of the fielders expect to be batting within minutes and start their mental preparations. If the last wicket partnership lasts much longer than they expect, it has an adverse effect on their preparation and composure, as well as their energy level deteriorating from extra time on the field. It is also damaging to the confidence of the bowlers if they are unable to dismiss a team's worst batsman relatively easily. A good example of this came in the First Test between Australia and New Zealand at Brisbane Cricket Ground in 2004. The Kiwis performed well for the first two-day, and while the Australians did recover strongly on the third, the New Zealanders were still well in the hunt when Glenn McGrath, the Australian fast bowler and notoriously poor batsman came to the crease to accompany fellow tail-ender Jason Gillespie with nine wickets down. Incredibly, the pair put on 114 runs, both achieving half centuries (McGrath's first in a long Test career in which he has never averaged more than 8 with the bat). The humiliated New Zealanders lost energy and focus, and when they finally removed McGrath <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to bat, their batting order was devastated, collapsing to 76 all out, giving Australia an innings victory with a day to spare. During second test of the 2005 Ashes, Australia's tailenders Shane Warne, Michael Kasprowicz and Brett Lee infamously held out during their second innings after the top order had been decimated by England's bowlers and nearly won a tightly-contested match, losing by a mere 2 runs - the narrowest margin in Ashes history - due to the contentious dismissal of Kasprowicz.|$|E
