5|$|The type of RNA editing {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme <b>adenosine</b> <b>deaminase</b> (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. elegans strains indicating that A→I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} {{youth of}} this field {{means there is}} still much progress to be made in characterizing all modifications to the transcriptome and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Once these questions are answered and biologists have a better sense of the amount of variation in RNA modification, the focus will turn to each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as <b>adenosine</b> <b>deaminase,</b> which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E
