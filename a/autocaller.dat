30|$|Blood {{samples were}} {{collected}} in K 3 -EDTA tubes. Proteinase K digestion and phenol–chloroform extraction were used to isolate genomic DNA from whole blood. Finally, DNA was purified and diluted to 10  ng/μL. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan technology and a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A 5 -μl reaction mixture consisting of 10  ng of DNA, 2.4  μL of TaqMan universal PCR master mix, 0.1  μL of {{forward and reverse primers}} and FAM and VIC probes, and 1.2  μl of H 2 O were prepared for PCR reaction. The TaqMan-MGB probes and primers were all ordered from Applied BioSystems. The genotype was determined automatically with the Sequence Detection System 2.1 software (95  % <b>autocaller</b> confidence level). Then, 5  % of the samples were repeated to determine the consistency, which was greater than 99.5  %. The genotype-calling success rates were greater than 99.9  %.|$|E
