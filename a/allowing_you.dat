500|$|Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer {{highlighted}} positively {{the first}} part of the mission. He remarked the game [...] " [...] a decent job of <b>allowing</b> <b>you</b> to feel like you're being stealthy as you negotiate your way past guards, usually by looking around for not-very-hidden alternate routes." [...] However, he criticized the final two thirds for being very linear and repetitive, and also reacted negatively to the game's insistence on having to fight solo almost the entire time. He explained that Mass Effect 2 is a squad game, where players [...] " [...] fluid team strategy to cope with different situations", but fighting solo means that players [...] "have to deal with every encounter in the exact same way." [...] Brad Gallaway, reviewer of GameCritics, concluded that the relatively short mission and included extras were not enough to justify the pack's price tag.

[...] Alternative Press called the music on In Light [...] "enthralling," [...] summarizing that [...] "Givers have created a debut that will surely set them atop the indie-rock world, if not only for their strict adherence to trying everything possible and succeeding gloriously at it all." [...] Jon Young of Spin recommended that the record is [...] "best absorbed in small portions, <b>allowing</b> <b>you</b> to savor the seriously catchy melodies and uplifting vibes," [...] feeling that the songs blur together when consumed at once.

2500|$|Moreover, Spivak further {{cautioned against}} {{ignoring}} subaltern peoples as [...] "cultural Others", {{and said that}} the West could progress—beyond the colonial perspective—by means of introspective self-criticism of the basic ideals and investigative methods that establish a culturally superior West studying the culturally inferior non–Western peoples. Hence, the integration of the subaltern voice to the intellectual spaces of social studies is problematic, because of the unrealistic opposition to the idea of studying [...] "Others"; Spivak rejected such an anti-intellectual stance by social scientists, and about them said that [...] "to refuse to represent a cultural Other is salving your conscience [...] <b>allowing</b> <b>you</b> not to do any homework." [...] Moreover, postcolonial studies also reject the colonial cultural depiction of subaltern peoples as hollow mimics of the European colonists and their Western ways; and rejects the depiction of subaltern peoples as the passive recipient-vessels of the imperial and colonial power of the Mother Country. Consequent to Foucault’s philosophic model of the binary relationship of power and knowledge, scholars from the Subaltern Studies Collective, proposed that anti-colonial resistance always counters every exercise of colonial power.|$|E
2500|$|Gameplay-wise, Kasumi {{was noted}} {{as one of}} the top {{characters}} in the series.

Strong stunning attacks, great combinations, and her speed, she's got it all." [...] In GameSpot's guide to Dead or Alive 4, Matthew Rorie wrote Kasumi is [...] "an interesting character for many reasons. While she doesn't rely on brute strength to get the job done, she has a dizzying array of quick strikes and more than a few teleportation moves to dazzle your opponents and pull them off guard, <b>allowing</b> <b>you</b> to sneak behind them and attack from the rear, or just confuse them mightily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some agency {{policies}} {{result in}} controversy. One gay activist felt Statistics New Zealand was [...] "breaking the law" [...] by omitting {{a question on}} the 2006 census regarding sexual orientation; the article in the New Zealand Herald elaborated [...] "Mr van Wetering and the Office of Human Rights Proceedings, the independent legal branch of the commission, expect to discuss {{the inclusion of the}} (sexual orientation) question in the 2011 Census with lawyers for Statistics New Zealand later this year." [...] There were some indications that the agency was seriously considering including a question on sexual orientation. The agency did focus groups exploring this possibility. Sometimes controversies involve disputes over whether agency data was cited properly. One blogger, claiming to be a former Wellingtonian journalist who identifies himself or herself as [...] "Poneke", accused the Sunday Star-Times of publishing misleading data about crime statistics. Poneke noted that “Statistics New Zealand now provide(s) the ability to query the New Zealand Police Statistics – <b>allowing</b> <b>you</b> to gather detailed crime information about your local area since 1994.” The blogger felt the agency was [...] "impeccably impartial", but distrusted various media sources.|$|E
