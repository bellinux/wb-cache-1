5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for convicts transported from Britain. Longer term local prisoners were also held there from 1858, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> the colonial government, as the then-newly {{constructed}} Perth Gaol had been handed over to the British imperial government for use as a convict station for short term prisoners. Local prisoners were also been kept in the Round House, or on Rottnest Island. In 1876 Perth Gaol was transferred back to local control.|$|E

5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> {{the human rights of}} those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. He boarded the troopship RMS Kaiser-i-Hind in London on 4 May 1919, and reached Hobart on 30 June, {{after a long}} sea voyage, a rail trip from Fremantle to Melbourne, passage across the Bass Strait, and a week in quarantine on Bruny Island due to the 1918 flu pandemic. As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he was greeted by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He {{came up with a plan}} for a temporary reclassification of positions, which would offer some relief, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> the government of £12,000. This was implemented in December. On 19 July 1920, he was formally knighted by the Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. Longer term locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> the colonial government. In 1868, penal {{transportation}} to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with the colonial government to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex – demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign in Extremadura, on 27 January 1811 Soult began his investment of Badajoz. Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura {{arrived in the}} vicinity with some 15,000 troops {{under the command of}} Gen. Mendizabal. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal. This posed a major threat to the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 prisoners, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.|$|E

5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (<b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E

25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{concentrated}} labour into mills, {{factories and}} mines, thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance {{the interests of}} working people.

Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> themselves or suffering {{the cost of the}} lost production.

25|$|Experimental {{literature}} suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E
