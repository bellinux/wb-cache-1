5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all.

40|$|This {{relative}} clause puzzle concerns a systematic {{and not yet}} understood difference between finite and infinitival relatives in English. Earlier work on the topic (see, for example, Chomsky and Lasnik 1977, Rizzi 1990, Déprez 1995 for discussion) has not yet provided a satisfactory account of the pattern illustrated here. In infinitival subject (1) and non-subject (2) -(3) {{relative clause}}s an overt relative pronoun is excluded. Only the empty operator is possible. (1) a. The man [Op [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The man [who [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (2) a. The book [Op [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The book [which [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (3) a. A linguist [Op [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *A linguist [whom [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. This restriction does not hold for finite relative clauses. As shown in the (b) -examples below, an overt wh-element can <b>be</b> used <b>in</b> all corresponding finite relative sentences: (4) a. *The man [Op [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. The man [who [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office...|$|R

25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favor.|$|E
