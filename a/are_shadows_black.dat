40|$|What colour <b>is</b> a <b>shadow?</b> <b>Black,</b> grey, or {{some other}} colour? This paper {{describes}} {{how to use a}} digital camera to test the hypothesis that a shadow under a clear blue sky has a blue tint. A white sheet of A 4 paper was photographed in full sunlight and in shadow under a clear blue sky. The images were analysed using a shareware program called ImageJ. The average red, green and blue pixel values in a region of interest drawn on a photo of the paper in sunlight and <b>shadow</b> <b>were</b> 0. 3, 0. 32, 0. 38 and 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 5 respectively, demonstrating that a shadow under a blue sky has a blue tint. The experiment would be a useful exercise for a science class...|$|R

60|$|Clavering {{very gently}} shook off her grasp, and Miss Schuyler almost admired {{him as he}} stood looking down upon her {{companion}} with the flickering firelight on his face. It was a striking face, and the smile in the dark eyes became it. Clavering had shaken off his furs, and the close-fitting jacket of dressed deerskin displayed his lean symmetry, for he had swung round in {{the entrance to the}} shanty and the <b>shadows</b> <b>were</b> <b>black</b> behind him.|$|R
50|$|Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch {{are three}} witches who live {{alone in the}} Marshes of Morva. Although their identities are {{apparently}} fluid and interchangeable, each persona has a distinctive appearance: Orwen wears a necklace of milky stones, Orddu's hair is adorned with many ornaments, and Orgoch's face <b>is</b> <b>shadowed</b> by a <b>black</b> cowl. They were the original owners of the Black Cauldron and lent it to Arawn, who used it to create zombie-like warriors, the Cauldron-Born. Later, they reclaimed it but were willing to relinquish it again {{in exchange for a}} magical price.|$|R
60|$|Burton came quickly in. He was paler, even, than usual, {{and there}} <b>were</b> <b>black</b> <b>shadows</b> under his eyes. There {{was a change}} in his face, indescribable but very apparent. His eyes had lost their dreamy look, he glanced furtively about him, he had {{the air of a}} man who has {{committed}} a crime and fears detection. His dress was not nearly so neat as usual. Mr. Waddington, whose bachelor evening clothes--a loose dinner-jacket and carefully tied black tie--were exactly as they should be, glanced disparagingly at his visitor.|$|R
60|$|Night had fallen. Their way lay {{through the}} shadow of Lone Star Mountain, deepened here and there by the slight, bosky ridges that, {{starting}} from its base, crept across the plain like vast roots of its swelling trunk. The <b>shadows</b> <b>were</b> growing <b>blacker</b> as the moon began to assert itself {{over the rest of}} the valley, when the Right Bower halted suddenly on one of these ridges. The Left Bower lounged up to him and stopped also, while the two others came up and completed the group.|$|R
50|$|Go Boy's <b>Shadow</b> <b>was</b> a <b>black</b> {{stallion}} by Merry Go Boy {{and out of}} Merry Walker. He was foaled in Searcy, Arkansas, on {{the farm}} of Dr. Porter Rodgers. At the age of four months he was sold to Winston Wiser, and Wiser then allowed E. H. Padgett to buy a half interest in the colt. At three years old in 1955, Go Boy's Shadow won his first World Grand Championship at the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. He repeated his win a year later, in 1956.Go Boy's <b>Shadow</b> <b>was</b> the last horse to repeat at the Celebration for nearly fifty years, until I Am Jose won the stake three years running, in 2013, 2014 and 2015.|$|R
60|$|But {{this is not}} {{the finest}} method of wood-cutting. It implies the idea of a system of light and shade in which the <b>shadow</b> <b>is</b> totally <b>black.</b> Now, no light and shade can be good, much less pleasant, in which all the shade is stark black. Therefore the finest wood-cutting ignores light and shade, and expresses only form, and dark local color. And it is convenient, for simplicity's sake, to {{anticipate}} what I should otherwise defer telling you until next lecture, that fine metal engraving, like fine wood-cutting, ignores light and shade; and that, in a word, all good engraving whatsoever does so.|$|R
6000|$|There <b>are</b> two <b>black</b> <b>shadows</b> {{walking to}} and fro in the quadrangle, near the statues of the Patron Saint and his sister; and hopping on behind them, {{in and out of}} the old arches, is a raven, croaking in answer to the bell, and uttering, at intervals, the purest Tuscan. How like a Jesuit he looks! There never was a sly and {{stealthy}} fellow so at home as is this raven, standing now at the refectory door, with his head on one side, and pretending to glance another way, while he is scrutinizing the visitors keenly, and listening with fixed attention. What a dull-headed monk the porter becomes in comparison! ...|$|R
60|$|That {{there is}} no 'effect of light' here arrived at, I beg you at once to observe as a most {{important}} lesson. The subject is St. Francis challenging the Soldan's Magi,--fire-worshippers--to pass with him through the fire, which is blazing red at his feet. It is so hot that the two Magi {{on the other side}} of the throne shield their faces. But it is represented simply as a red mass of writhing forms of flame; and casts no firelight whatever. There is no ruby colour on anybody's nose: there <b>are</b> no <b>black</b> <b>shadows</b> under anybody's chin; there are no Rembrandtesque gradations of gloom, or glitterings of sword-hilt and armour.|$|R
50|$|ZeLeLi is {{a mighty}} gearwheel-shaped being created {{out of the}} essence of our dying sun 7 billion years in the future. ZeLeLi is the origin of time, life and light so it {{possesses}} power over these universal forces. Travelling through time and space, ZeLeLi spreads the seed of life and light in all time in the whole universe. Its counterpart <b>are</b> the <b>black</b> <b>Shadow</b> Plättchen. Forcefully {{cut out of the}} negative space of a black hole, the <b>black</b> <b>Shadow</b> Plättchen represent exactly the opposite of ZeLeLi. Like the ZeLeLi, Plättchen are not limited within the constrains of time and space.Wherever they come along they spread massive havoc. Central to the plot of the game are two main characters, the games hero Kubi and the game designer Bernd. He appears as a through the air floating pixel head and talks to Kubi during the games sequences.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first model}} from Vincent was the Rapide, {{followed}} by the <b>Black</b> <b>Shadow</b> {{in response to a}} demand for a more [...] "sports oriented model". The <b>Black</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>was</b> developed from an early-model Rapide that had been specially tuned by factory tester and racer George Brown, his brother Cliff and designer Phil Irving. With relatively minor modifications, such as enlarged ports, bigger carburettors and increased compression, the test model, known as [...] "Gunga Din", gave , creating the basis for the <b>Black</b> <b>Shadow.</b> The <b>Black</b> <b>Shadow</b> proved very popular and its production overtook the Rapide. The <b>Black</b> <b>Shadow's</b> engine, instead of being cradled in a set of frame rails, was suspended from above, becoming a stressed member, or integral part, of the structure.|$|R
60|$|Obs. 6. I placed another Knife by this, so {{that their}} edges might be parallel, and look towards one another, and that the beam of Light might fall upon both the Knives, and some part of it pass between their edges. And when the {{distance}} of their edges was about the 400th part of an Inch, the stream parted in the middle, and left a Shadow between the two parts. This <b>Shadow</b> <b>was</b> so <b>black</b> and dark that all the Light which passed between the Knives seem'd to be bent, and turn'd aside to the one hand or to the other. And as the Knives still approach'd one another the Shadow grew broader, and the streams shorter at their inward ends which <b>were</b> next the <b>Shadow,</b> until upon the contact of the Knives the whole Light vanish'd, leaving its place to the Shadow.|$|R
60|$|The {{moonlight}} {{showed it}} all iron gray, except where some elephants stood upon it, and their <b>shadows</b> <b>were</b> inky <b>black.</b> Little Toomai looked, holding his breath, {{with his eyes}} starting out of his head, and as he looked, {{more and more and}} more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the tens, and his head began to swim. Outside the clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks they moved like ghosts.|$|R
60|$|And now the long, cold, weary {{night was}} over, {{and the deep}} blue-black sky had {{lightened}} to a wonderful mauve-violet, with the larger stars still glinting brightly out of it. Behind them the grey line had crept higher and higher, deepening into a delicate rose-pink, with the fan-like rays of the invisible sun shooting and quivering across it. Then, suddenly, they felt its warm touch upon their backs, and there <b>were</b> hard <b>black</b> <b>shadows</b> upon the sand in front of them. The Dervishes loosened their cloaks and proceeded to talk cheerily among themselves. The prisoners also began to thaw, and eagerly ate the doora which was served out for their breakfasts. A short halt had been called, {{and a cup of}} water handed to each.|$|R

60|$|After {{that they}} set out {{together}} down the little trail that led past the willows to the lode, slipping as silently as possible through the shadows, though {{now and then a}} stone clinked beneath their feet, or a stick or twig snapped as they passed, with a sound that seemed startlingly loud. Nobody, however, seemed to hear them, and at last they sank down amidst a brake of tall fern near a little, neatly-squared stake which had been driven into the soil. The brake <b>was</b> in <b>black</b> <b>shadow,</b> but a broad patch of moonlight fell on the green carpet of wineberries a yard or two away. The rustling had ceased, and they could hear nothing for several anxious minutes; then it commenced again. A man floundering through that kind of bush makes considerable noise, even when it is daylight and he can see where he is going. Then one of the jumpers, who apparently had fallen into a clump of thorns, broke out into half-smothered expletives, and there was a soft laugh, evidently from a comrade.|$|R
