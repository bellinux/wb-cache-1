5|$|After {{driving home}} from work, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{is struck by}} a drunk driver and transported to a hospital, where she is {{examined}} by Dr. Preijers (Jack Blessing) and Nurse Edwards; she soon slips into a coma. Reyes, however, wakes up moments later {{in the same room}} all alone. Running to the door, she discovers that the hospital is floating in a dark void. She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are dead. Reyes, however, maintains that they are still alive.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} point of Jewish Law arises in that Rav Yisroel {{raised the question}} how could the Tribe of Reuven have kept the semikhah alive, since they were outside the Land of Israel and the semikhah can be granted only in Land of Israel. He answered that since the Bnei Reuven had been distant {{from the rest of}} Klal Yisroel before this ruling had been accepted, {{there is no reason to}} <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> accepted this ruling, and there was a chance that they were still keeping the institution of semikhah alive.|$|E
25|$|Some {{proponents of}} Philosophy of Life, Vitalism, Critical realism (in German {{speaking}} countries) {{argued that there}} is a fundamental difference between physical, biological and psychological phenomena. For example, Henri Bergson (1921), who otherwise was a proponent of special relativity, argued that time dilation cannot be applied to biological organisms, therefore he denied the relativistic solution of the twin paradox. However, those claims were rejected by Paul Langevin, André Metz and others. Biological organisms consist of physical processes, so {{there is no reason to}} <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not subject to relativistic effects like time dilation.|$|E

25|$|The {{last two}} chapters, also called 6 Ezra by scholars, and {{found in the}} Latin, {{but not in the}} Eastern texts, predict wars and rebuke sinners. Many <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{probably}} date from a much later period (perhaps late third century) and may be Christian in origin; it is possible, though not certain, that they were added {{at the same time as}} the first two chapters of the Latin version. It is possible that they are Jewish in origin, however; 15:57–59 have been found in Greek, which most scholars agree was translated from a Hebrew original.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{lifespan}} of drones and Minds, {{given the}} durability of Culture technology and the aforementioned options of mindstate backups, {{it is reasonable to}} <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> live as long as they choose. Even Minds, with their utmost complexity, are known to be backed up (and reactivated if they for example die in a risky mission, see GSV Lasting Damage). It is noted that even Minds themselves do not necessarily live forever either, often choosing to eventually sublime or even committing suicide (as does the double-Mind GSV Lasting Damage due to its choices in the Culture-Idiran war).|$|E
25|$|The Daleks {{also appear}} in Lego Dimensions where they ally {{themselves}} with Lord Vortech and possess the size-altering scale keystone. When Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle encounter them, they <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{allies of the}} Doctor and attack the trio. The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until they call the Doctor to save them. A Dalek saucer also appears in the level based on Metropolis, in which {{the top of it}} serves as the stage for the boss battle against Sauron and includes Daleks among the various enemies summoned to attack the player. A Dalek is also among the elements summoned by the player to deal with the obstacles in the Portal 2 story level.|$|E

25|$|Higher male {{secondary}} school enrollment, {{per capita income}} and economic growth rate all had significant effects on reducing the chance of civil war. Specifically, a male {{secondary school}} enrollment 10% above the average reduced {{the chance of a}} conflict by about 3%, while a growth rate 1% higher than the study average resulted in a decline in the chance of a civil war of about 1%. The study interpreted these three factors as proxies for earnings forgone by rebellion, and therefore that lower forgone earnings encourage rebellion. Phrased another way: young males (who make up the vast majority of combatants in civil wars) are less likely to join a rebellion if they are getting an education or have a comfortable salary, and can reasonably <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will prosper in the future.|$|E
25|$|All three enclosures, {{the only}} sites {{of this type}} known from the county, are notable for their small size and {{circular}} shape. In national terms their morphology is rather anomalous, a characteristic which can be interpreted {{in a number of}} ways. It has been suggested that they may {{have more in common with}} hengiform monuments of the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age than with 'normal' causewayed enclosures of the fourth millennium BC. Alternatively, they might represent a regional tradition distinct to this part of the country. In addition, the geographical distribution of the sites is confined to north-east Norfolk. While some allowance can be made for the usual factors associated with the distribution of cropmark sites (soils, geology, etc.), at present it seems that the clustering of the three sites in the north-east of the county may be of archaeological significance. The smaller dimensions of the Norfolk sites may be a reflection of the size and dispersal of the communities creating, maintaining and using them and it may not be necessary to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> occurred later than elsewhere in Britain. Although at present no excavation has taken place on any of the Norfolk 'causewayed' enclosures so these questions have yet to be answered.|$|E
500|$|Chinese diplomats {{moved to}} {{pressure}} other countries not {{to attend the}} award ceremony, which was scheduled for 10 December. The diplomatic missions of democratic countries in Oslo received warning letters from their Chinese counterparts; the deputy foreign minister also warned countries of [...] "the consequences". In December, the Chinese foreign ministry continued the rhetorical assault, claiming [...] "more than 100 countries and international organisations [...] expressed explicit support of China's position". In the end, 46 countries attended of the 65 invited (People's Republic of China and 19 other nations declined invitations). China's official news agency, Xinhua, attacked the West for its [...] "Cold-War or even colonial mentality", and for daring to [...] "regard themselves as the judge, the teacher [...] <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can forever distort the fact and block the truth by using political maneuvers." [...] Strong rhetoric and denunciations {{of the free world}} continued from official sources until after the ceremony.|$|E

500|$|The Guitar Trio {{continued}} touring in 1980. De Lucía reportedly {{suffered from}} headaches and backaches while performing because {{he found it}} difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, [...] "Some people <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were learning from me, but I can tell you it was me learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don't have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things." [...] In 1981, Coryell was replaced with Di Meola, and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, Friday Night in San Francisco, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed Monasterio de Sal and Montino among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.|$|E
500|$|Dana Jan {{stated the}} reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because [...] "It seemed {{to make a lot}} of sense to fill in that void." [...] Jan said with some scenes, [...] "the team wasn't sure how gamers would react" [...] because [...] "God of War usually doesn't slow...down" [...] and the team [...] "worried if these scenes would be {{captivating}} enough to keep player interested and still feel like God of War." [...] For puzzles, Jan stated that they tried to make the outcomes unexpected because players <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will have to [...] "push something, carry a body or smash something with [...] blades." [...] Hinting at a possible future installment from Ready at Dawn, Jan stated that he is [...] "intrigued" [...] by the flashbacks in God of War and God of War II and that [...] "There's definitely a back story to Kratos that nobody's touched on." [...] For the character Deimos, Jan stated that the first reference was actually in the Chains of Olympus finale. In the game, Helios states [...] "Do you think that they'll survive?" [...] and Athena says [...] "They must." [...] Jan said that this line was [...] "purposefully put" [...] in that game and that there are also references to Deimos in God of War III. He confirmed that Kratos and Deimos are not twins and that while Kratos' father is Zeus, [...] "Deimos' father is more of a mystery." [...] He confirmed that a character named Dominus appears in the game (Kratos' original name) and [...] "the scene featuring a soldier named Dominus was a nod to that." [...] He also stated that he does not know where God of War: Betrayal fits chronologically in the series.|$|E
2500|$|As the Futurists {{advocated}} the aforementioned intuition and the bucking of tradition, one might <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would suppress {{the use of}} irony. On the contrary, irony proved to be [...] "so old and forgotten that it looked almost new when the dust was brushed away from it. What was new and untried, at least more so than their principles and theories, were the futurists' stylistic devices".|$|E

2500|$|The {{involvement}} of the Carpi in attacks by the Free Dacians into Roman Dacia is also uncertain. Supporters of a Dacian ethnicity for the Carpi have tended to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> participated in campaigns where Roman emperors claimed the title Dacicus Maximus, {{in addition to those}} resulting in a Carpicus Maximus acclamation. But all incursions in which the Carpi are specifically reported by ancient sources were into Moesia Inferior, not Dacia. The following is a list of recorded incursions in which Carpi participation is specifically attested to by the sources: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{was done}} in 1900, when Poincaré derived local time by {{assuming}} that {{the speed of light}} is invariant within the aether. Due to the [...] "principle of relative motion", moving observers within the aether also <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are at rest and that the speed of light is constant in all directions (only to first order in v/c). Therefore, if they synchronize their clocks by using light signals, they will only consider the transit time for the signals, but not their motion in respect to the aether. So the moving clocks are not synchronous and do not indicate the [...] "true" [...] time. Poincaré calculated that this synchronization error corresponds to Lorentz's local time.|$|E
2500|$|All {{lakes and}} ponds receive {{sediment}} inputs. [...] Since these {{systems are not}} really expanding, it is logical to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will become increasingly shallower in depth, eventually becoming wetlands or terrestrial vegetation. [...] The length of this process should depend upon a combination of depth and sedimentation rate. Moss gives the example of Lake Tanganyika, which reaches a depth of 1500 m and has a sedimentation rate of 0.5nbsp&mm/yr. [...] Assuming that sedimentation is not influenced by anthropogenic factors, this system should go extinct in approximately 3 million years. [...] Shallow lentic systems might also fill in as swamps encroach inward from the edges. [...] These processes operate on a much shorter timescale, taking hundreds to thousands of years to complete the extinction process.|$|E

2500|$|Besides liberty, {{liberals have}} {{developed}} several other principles {{important to the}} construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism, and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, Voltaire commented, [...] "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things." [...] All forms of liberalism assume, in some basic sense, that individuals are equal. In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all possess the same right to liberty. In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else, and all people are equal subjects before the law. Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher John Rawls emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their aspirations in life. Libertarian thinker Robert Nozick disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of Lockean equality instead.|$|E
2500|$|While al-Kindi {{appreciated}} {{the usefulness of}} philosophy in answering questions of a religious nature, there would be many Islamic thinkers who were not as enthusiastic about its potential. But it would be incorrect to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> opposed philosophy simply {{because it was a}} [...] "foreign science". Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even al-Ghazali, who is famous for his critique of the philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic. And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. The three most serious of these, in his view, were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things (not all philosophers subscribed to these same views).|$|E
2500|$|As Asher {{explains}} in Danse Macabre, he is bisexual and deeply {{in love with}} Jean-Claude. [...] Realizing that Jean-Claude, although bisexual, prefers women, Asher was able to form a stable relationship only with their mutual lover, Julianna. [...] After arriving in St. Louis, Asher {{fell in love with}} both Jean-Claude and Anita, but feared that they could not love him fully, either because of his scars or because of their feelings for each other. [...] Recently, he has accepted that both Jean-Claude and Anita love him for himself, although he is unwilling to be restricted to one-way monogamy with Anita, resulting in a longtime dalliance with Narcissus. (Many of Jean-Claude's vampires, and even Anita herself, <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have an affair but this relationship is denied by both of them.
