5|$|The canal {{was absorbed}} by the British Waterways Board in 1962. The Conservators carried out an <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> in 1965, the first since 1947, but had to use a motor coach {{for most of the}} journey, as the locks were unusable. With the passing of the Transport Act 1968, the canal was {{classified}} as a remainder waterway – little more than a drainage channel. Only essential maintenance to keep it safe was to be carried out. Soon afterwards, part of the cutting wall between West Street and Albert Street collapsed, and although the bed of the canal was cleared to ensure water could reach the dock, the towpath remained blocked for another nine years. Bridgwater Docks, which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping, were finally closed in 1971: the connection at the docks was stopped up, and the British Waterways Board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the act, the canal company {{inherited}} the debts of the Conservators, and paid them an additional £2,000. They were required to rebuild part of the North Town Bridge in Taunton, and to return the Tone Navigation to good order. The Conservators were empowered to carry out an <b>annual</b> <b>inspection,</b> and to re-possess the river if the canal was not properly maintained. The £2,000 was held by the Conservators until 1838, when they applied for an order to dispose of it, {{but it was not until}} 1843 that the order was granted. £1,000 was used to build a new wing for the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and £1,000 was invested in the Taunton Market Trust, in line with the intentions of the 1699 act.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the new canal were marred by legal {{disputes}} with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to the Tone at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the Canal Company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that they were taking over the Tone, and evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King's Bench that their action was illegal, the Canal Company held on to the river until a High Court judgement in February 1830. The Conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which they removed after further legal action and an Order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new Act of Parliament to authorise the sale of the Tone Navigation to the Canal Company. This was obtained in July 1832, and required the Canal Company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the wharfs in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the Conservators were allowed to conduct an <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.|$|E

25|$|The {{battalion}} did {{not have}} its own drill hall, and drill parades were held at Regent's Park, the Ditch of the Tower of London and at Gray's Inn Square. Prize-givings and inspections were held in the Guildhall, and the <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> was carried out at Horse Guards Parade. Church parades were held at St Bride's Church, Fleet Street. The headquarters was first at 26 Great Tower Street, then 38 New Broad Street, both in the City, and afterwards at 76 Farringdon Road in Clerkenwell, but in 1903 the battalion raised enough money to obtain larger premises at Sun Street, Finsbury Square.|$|E
25|$|The Inquiry heard {{evidence}} that the <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> of VH-UYY had been completed on 2 November 1944 and since then it had flown for 525 hours. At an inspection of this kind {{it was possible to}} examine most of the welded joints in the wing, but not the welded spar joint that ultimately failed. That joint had not been inspected since installation of Pratt & Whitney engines in 1943. The Inquiry also heard that the maximum weights of all civil aircraft registered in Australia were determined conservatively and in a manner that was consistent with the International Convention on Aerial Navigation. The increase in maximum weight of VH-UYY was only granted after all appropriate calculations had been performed to ensure the aircraft was safe at the increased weight.|$|E

25|$|On 15 June 1936, Jones {{departed}} New York with reserve {{officers on}} board for training cruises in the Caribbean which continued through September. In October, she participated in joint Army-Navy coastal maneuvers; and, following her <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> at Norfolk, she participated in minesweeping training during February 1937. In March, she trained {{officers of the}} 5th Fleet Reserve and in June she resumed training cruises for midshipmen. She continued to operate as a practice ship for reserve officers until 15 January 1938, when she departed Norfolk for fleet landing exercises and battle maneuvers in waters off Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Jones returned to Norfolk 13 March for overhaul. In June she resumed operations out of Norfolk, serving as a carrier plane guard and conducting torpedo and gunnery practice.|$|E
25|$|On October 25, 2016, four people—two men aged 35 and 38, and {{two women}} aged 32 and 42—were killed when the raft they were riding hit another stopped raft, causing it to flip. Eyewitness {{accounts}} noted that the water level in the channel had dropped prior to the incident, but the drop did not trigger a sensor that would have stopped the ride. Investigators believe that the occupied raft was pushed up onto a stopped raft by a conveyor belt, at first mounting the stopped raft then flipping over. Of the six passengers aboard the raft, two children—aged 10 and 12—were ejected from the raft but survived, while {{the two men were}} believed to be crushed under the raft and the two women were trapped underneath the conveyor belt. Dreamworld officials stated that the ride had just passed its <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> in September. On November 9 Ardent Leisure chief executive Deborah Thomas announced that the ride would be permanently closed and demolished.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} {{airworthiness}} directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator control cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the <b>annual</b> <b>inspection.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 3 December 1906 Alfred Richardson, {{was given}} {{permission}} {{to join the}} General and Finance Committee of the Northern Police Orphanage and Convalescent Home in Halifax. Chief Constables were encouraged to add their patronage. He wrote a booklet for his men which was an extract from a Council meeting held on 7 May 1906. It was written so that {{all members of the}} Force could know the regulations to which it was their duty to confirm. In 1907 there were several disturbances in Commercial Road, Halifax, during the tram drivers strike, causing much extra work for the police. The local press praised the constabulary for their restraints in handling this situation. By this time Richardson had increased further the reputation of the force as one with a strict sense of discipline and generally having a smart turn out, a sentiment reflected in the local newspapers. Richardson was known to have a love of horses, even to wearing spurs in his office at Harrison Road. Halifax was soon to have its own horses and stables, rather than hire them. Horses were increasingly seen as effective in crowd control. In the <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> by His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Sir Llewelyn Atcherley in 1930, the Borough Mounted Police in full dress uniform were presented by Richardson to the Inspector.|$|E
