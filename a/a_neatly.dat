5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E

Sehwag completed his hundred with <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> timed, and powerful drive through midwicket for four, from just 144 balls. He had by that time, 16 boundaries and a six to his credit.|$|E
25|$|Although Gull {{variants}} were {{powered by}} five different engines, those were all inverted inline air-cooled types driving two-bladed propellers, making for <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> faired installation. The rear fuselage was of square cross section with a rounded top. The glazed cabin joined smoothly into a raised dorsal fairing, {{and placed the}} pilot in front and two passenger seats, slightly staggered behind. Entry into the early models was via the sliding canopy. The main undercarriage was fixed and spatted, each wheel mounted on three struts in the early models; {{there was a small}} steerable tail wheel.|$|E

He worked at The New York Times but was fired for refusing to cross a picket line during a typesetters' strike. A leader in the East River chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Kemble helped to organize a non-violent blockade of the Triborough Bridge during rush hour, to raise consciousness among suburbanites {{of the lives of}} Harlem residents. Kemble was a founder of Negotiation Now!, a group which {{called for an end to}} the bombing of North Vietnam and a negotiated settlement of the Vietnam War.

25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E

500|$|Some {{sixty years}} prior to the series, Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko founded the United Republic of Nations, and its capital Republic City. In the {{following}} years, Aang married Katara and they have three children: Bumi [...] (named for Aang's old friend), Kya (after Katara's deceased mother), and Tenzin. In his adult years, Aang grew <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> cropped chinstrap beard, which many statues of Aang's adult form depict him with, including the one in the restored Southern Air Temple. He also founded the Air Acolytes, a sect who eschewed their home cultures in favor of following the Air Nomads' way of life (the comics reveal that the first Air Acolytes were the reorganized Avatar Fan Club). [...] A forty-year-old Aang assisted Toph in arresting Water Tribe crime lord Yakone. As Aang watched the trial where Yakone was convicted of using the rare and illegal technique Bloodbending, Yakone tried to escape Republic City, using his unique abilities to subdue everyone in the court room, thus leaving them unconscious. Able to resist Yakone's Bloodbending through the Avatar State, Aang used his Energybending abilities to put a halt to Yakone's plans.|$|E

Though {{there is no evidence that}} priests or monarchs ruled Mohenjo-daro, archaeologists dubbed this dignified figure a [...] "Priest-King." [...] The sculpture is [...] tall, and shows <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> bearded man with pierced earlobes and a fillet around his head, possibly all that is left of a once-elaborate hairstyle or head-dress; his hair is combed back. He wears an armband, and a cloak with drilled trefoil, single circle and double circle motifs, which show traces of red. His eyes might have originally been inlaid.|$|E
2500|$|Stephens {{rose to the}} top of his {{profession}} as a test pilot for some of the most exotic aircraft in the USAF inventory. In 1949, he graduated from the Air Materiel Command Experimental Test Pilot School at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base with Class 49D. He was called the [...] "Silver Fox" [...] due to his prematurely gray hair which he kept in <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> trimmed crew cut. In 1952, Stephens arrived at Edwards Air Force Base, California to serve as Chief of Fighter Operations. From 1963 to 1968, he served as test director of the YF-12 and SR-71 test force. He was the first military pilot to fly the YF-12A interceptor and the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up on four longerons, spruce {{at the rear}} where they were linked into a tapering Warren girder, and ash ahead of the rear cockpit where more traditional wire braced rectangular forms were used. [...] It was topped with a standard rounded decking. [...] The two open cockpits were placed at the leading and trailing [...] upper wing edges and fitted with dual controls. [...] The [...] flat twin Bristol Cherub III was mounted on a steel plate and smoothly partially cowled to <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> pointed nose, but with the cylinder heads exposed for cooling. [...] At {{the rear of the}} fuselage the fin and tailplane were fabric covered metal structures, though the generous control surfaces were wood framed. [...] Fin and rudder together formed a shape not unlike that of many de Havilland aircraft though more rounded and unbalanced. [...] The main undercarriage was built from a pair of steel V-shaped tubes bearing a single axle and rubber cord shock absorbers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1863 {{he moved}} for {{separate}} schools for juvenile delinquents rather than flogging and imprisonment which {{he saw as}} producing hardened criminals. His efforts led to a juvenile reformatory not far from Etawah. He also started free schools in Etawah and by 1857 he established 181 schools with 5186 students including two girls. The high school that he helped build with his own money is still in operation, now as a junior college, and it {{was said to have}} a floor plan resembling the letter [...] "H". This, according to some was an indication of Hume's imperial ego. Hume found the idea of earning revenue earned through liquor traffic repulsive and described it as [...] "The wages of sin". With his progressive ideas on social reform, he advocated women's education, was against infanticide and enforced widowhood. Hume laid out in Etawah, <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> gridded commercial district that is now known as Humeganj but often pronounced Homeganj.|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{heard about}} the {{disaster}} by noon that day. He immediately beat a retreat toward Alicante, dropping off a 2,200-man all-arms brigade under Colonel Frederick Adam at the pass of Biar to cover his withdrawal. On the morning of 12 April, Suchet captured a Spanish battalion at Villena and set out in pursuit of Murray. At Biar, the French came up with Adam's rearguard but were unable to overrun the well-handled force, which consisted of British, King's German Legion, Italian and Spanish elements. In a brilliant five-hour action, Adam successfully fended off his French pursuers, allowing Murray to concentrate his army at Castalla. In one incident, Suchet's cavalry raced after their enemies after flushing the Allied soldiers from Biar. But this attempt to turn a retreat into a rout failed when the French troopers charged into <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> executed ambush by three companies of the 2/27th Foot. During the action, the French suffered about 300 casualties and Adam lost 260 killed and wounded plus 41 missing. The British colonel was forced to abandon two of his four cannons.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, {{there is quite a}} bit of roiling darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and light, control of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (do they really have any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne into the middle of next week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, <b>a</b> <b>neatly</b> segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E
