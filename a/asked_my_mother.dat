He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times." ...|$|E

60|$|Whether {{it was the}} {{following}} Sunday when I saw the gentleman again, or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared, I cannot recall. I don't profess {{to be clear about}} dates. But there he was, in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too, to look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour-window. It did not appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose it for himself, but he refused to do that--I could not understand why--so she plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would never, never part with it any more; and I thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had often}} heard allusions of this nature, and I had several times {{observed}} the quiet smile of my mother, {{as she listened}} to them; smiles that seemed to contradict the opinion to which my grandmother's mistaken notions of her own influence had given birth. On one occasion (I was still quite a boy), I remember to have <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> how the fact was, when the answer was, [...] "I married your father through the influence of a butcher's boy;" [...] a reply that had some reference to a very early passage in the lives of my parents. But I well know that Cornelius Littlepage, nor Anneke Mordaunt, was a person to be coaxed into matrimony; and I resolved on the spot, their only son should manifest an equal independence. I might have answered my grandmother to this effect, and in language stronger than was my practice when addressing that reverend parent, had not the two girls appeared on the piazza at that moment, and broke up our private conference.|$|E

I believed that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was accredited to being the first to incorporate green tea powder with ice cream! More of my recollections were of the koi pond. It contained 50-100 koi and the famous wisteria arbors.

It is not because they do not like you, you know; and the Admiral said that he could very well trust me with you. But when my mother told him that I had ridden with you for the last four days, he said that it would cause jealousy, when there were so many young French nobles and gentlemen in the camp, if I were to choose you in {{preference}} to them as my companion; you being only French on your mother's side, and having an English name. I begged them to let me tell you this, for I would rather ride with you than with any of them; and I should not like you to think that I did not care to have you with me, any more.|$|E
6000|$|Hillside Church was {{the only}} one in the {{neighbourhood}} where Holy Week or Ascension Day had been observed in the memory of man. When we proposed going to church on the latter day the gardener <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> 'if it was her will to keep Thursday holy,' as if he expected its substitution for Sunday. Monthly Communions and Baptisms after the Second Lesson were viewed as 'not fit for a country church,' and every attempt at even more secular improvements was treated with the most disappointing distrust and aversion. When my father laid out the allotment grounds, the labourers suspected some occult design for his own profit, and the farmers objected that the gardens would be used as an excuse for neglecting their work and stealing their potatoes. Coal-club and clothing-club were regarded in like manner, and while a few took advantage of these offers in a grudging manner, the others viewed everything except absolute gifts as 'me-an' on our part, the principle of aid to self-help being an absolute novelty. [...] When I look back to the notes in our journals of that date I see how much has been overcome.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} accompanying {{my mother}} {{on a visit to}} the old house we have just left, in the summer, when I was at home for the holidays. It was a lovely, sunshiny morning. There was nobody indoors, and we walked out into the garden. As we approached that lawn yonder, {{on the other side of}} the shrubbery, I saw, first, a young woman in mourning (apparently a servant) sitting reading; then a little girl, dressed all in black, moving toward us slowly over the bright turf, and holding up before her a baby, whom she was trying to teach to walk. She looked, to my ideas, so very young to be engaged in such an occupation as this, and her gloomy black frock appeared to be such an unnaturally grave garment for a mere child of her age, and looked so doubly dismal by contrast with the brilliant sunny lawn on which she stood, that I quite started when I first saw her, and eagerly <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who she was. The answer informed me of the sad family story, which I have been just relating to you. Mrs. Welwyn had then been buried about three months; and Ida, in her childish way, was trying, as she had promised, to supply her mother's place to her infant sister Rosamond.|$|E

Nader, remembered today as “the reason why Al Gore lost”, was a progressive politician who ran as a Green Party candidate and my mom, a leftist single-mother, was ideologically much closer to him than Gore (something even a nine year old could recognize). But my Mom responded, “because I’m a Democrat (the equivalent of Labour), I’ve always voted Democrat, and they need me more”. The latter statement proved true, but the ones that preceded it stuck with me as problematic...|$|R

40|$|The {{story behind}} this {{research}} project begins in 1962 when, at age 11, I developed {{an eating disorder}} and began to keep a diary. The themes and threads that bind the story together, however, began to weave a pattern {{almost as soon as}} I was born. In early childhood, the world through my eyes comprised a small, beautiful valley adjoining the Mitchell River National Park in Victoria, Australia. I lived on a dairy farm with my parents and sister. For my first 11 years, my home had no electricity, television or Internet, but my days were full. The farm, river and adjacent bushland provided a natural outdoors playground, seeding my imagination. Indoors, on rainy days and at night by lantern-light, at the solid oak kitchen table, I would <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> for pen and paper and write a note or two about my day. A friendship with words was already taking hold. Associated Grant:RTP; RT...|$|R
6000|$|From October 1779 to 1781. I had <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> {{one evening}} to cut my cheese entire, so that I might toast it. This was no easy matter, {{it being a}} [...] "crumbly" [...] cheese. My Mother however did it. I went into the garden for {{something}} or other, and in the mean time my brother Frank minced my cheese, to [...] "disappoint the favourite." [...] I returned, saw the exploit, and in an agony of passion flew at Frank. He pretended to have been seriously hurt by my blow, flung himself on the ground, and there lay with outstretched limbs. I hung over him mourning and in a great fright; he leaped up, and with a horse-laugh gave me a severe blow in the face. I seized a knife, and was running at him, when my Mother came in and took me by the arm. I expected a flogging, and, struggling from her, I ran away to a little hill or slope, {{at the bottom of}} which the Otter flows, about a mile from Ottery. There I staid; my rage died away, but my obstinacy vanquished my fears, and taking out a shilling book, which had at the end morning and evening prayers, I very devoutly repeated them--thinking at the same time with a gloomy inward satisfaction--how miserable my Mother must be! I distinctly remember my feelings, when I saw a Mr. Vaughan pass over the bridge at about a furlong's distance, and how I watched the calves in the fields beyond the river. It grew dark, and I fell asleep. It was towards the end of October, and it proved a stormy night. I felt the cold in my sleep, and dreamed that I was pulling the blanket over me, and actually pulled over me a dry thorn-bush which lay on the ground near me. In my sleep I had rolled {{from the top of the}} hill till within three yards of the river, which flowed by the unfenced edge of the bottom. I awoke several times, and finding myself wet, and cold, and stiff, closed my eyes again that I might forget it.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2008 If I Were to <b>Ask</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> is a {{collection}} of personal essays that focuses on the [...] narrator’s attempt to recreate her past through exploring childhood memories and entries [...] of family diaries and other artifacts. In the first essay, the narrator’s childhood diaries are [...] destroyed by her mother, an act seen by the adult narrator as an attempt by the mother to [...] silence her daughter’s voice. The difficult mother/daughter relationship is a theme in the [...] remaining essays as the narrator attempts to recreate the destroyed past by exploring her [...] childhood memories.

Just so, in that limbo of nonexistent spare time, our Association has published its Journal. The charter members who foresaw its need were busy men.
