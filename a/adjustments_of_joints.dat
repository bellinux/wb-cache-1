40|$|We {{present a}} general joint {{component}} framework model that {{is capable of}} exhibiting complex behavior <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> in articulated figures. The <b>joints</b> are capable <b>of</b> handling non-orthogonal, non-intersecting axes of rotation and changing joint centers that are often found in the kinematics <b>of</b> real anatomical <b>joints.</b> The <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> articulation is done with a relatively small set of intuitive parameters compared to the number of articulations in the motions they parameterize.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Purpose: To {{establish}} the immediate effect <b>of</b> sacroiliac <b>joint</b> <b>adjustment</b> on functional leg length Method: Seventy participants were randomly divided in two equal groups. Participants of Group A (n= 35) leg length was measured pre and immediately post <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> dysfunctional sacroiliac <b>joint.</b> Group B (n= 35) {{received the same}} assessment protocol with no adjustment being administered. The trial consisted of one treatment session only in which all data was obtained. Objective data consisted of measuring participant’s leg length from the anterior superior iliac spine to {{the apex of the}} medial malleolus using the standardized tape measure method. Subjective data was obtained through performing four sacroiliac joint orthopaedic tests or each participant’s and recording the results. Results: The subjective results showed positive results in at least three out of four of the orthopedic tests for the participants of both groups. The sacral thrust technique and sacroiliac joint compression showed a greater percentage positive result in Group A at 91. 4 % where as the sacroiliac joint distraction was positive in 94. 3 % of the participants in Group B. Gaenslen’s showed the least accuracy with a positive result in 82. 9 % of participants in Group A and 74. 3 % in Group B. Objectively, Shapiro-Wilk analysis indicated a statistically significant (p = 0. 014) change in the length of the left leg after treatment in Group A. A significant change in the length of both the right (p = 0. 002) and left (p = 0. 034) leg was found in Group B following assessment. Conclusion: The study showed that <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the sacroiliac <b>joint</b> does not consistently result in change in functional leg length inequality. This information suggests that the assessment of functional leg length should not be used as the sole assessment tool in the diagnosis <b>of</b> sacroiliac <b>joint</b> dysfunction. Practitioners should rather incorporate a variety of assessment methods as the inequality may be caused by factors unrelated to the dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Luminous {{efficiency}} and color temperature of LED chip {{are affected by}} current and temperature. PWM dimming mode only works at two kinds of current levels-rated current and zero current. It has smaller effect on color temperature compared with linear dimming mode, but it will reduce the luminous efficiency of lamps. Linear dimming mode has higher luminous efficiency by comparison. The two dimming modes above cannot keep color temperature stable and Luminous efficiency high. Therefore, the paper designed a joint dimming mode by integrating advantages of the two modes. The dimming method not only adjusts peak current, but also changes the duty cycle of dimming signals. The injected average current is kept stable by reducing peak current and increasing the duty cycle. The decreased luminous efficiency by the raise of temperature was made up for. Then according to the mathematical model of total flux and current, the author calculates the mathematical mode of flux affected by temperature. It proves the fact that adjusting peak current slightly can compensates for the reduced luminous efficiency affected by temperature through theoretical calculation. In addition, the final peak current after calculation {{can contribute to the}} <b>adjustment</b> parameter <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> dimming modes...|$|R
40|$|Anticipatory {{control of}} motor output enables fast and fluent {{execution}} of movement. This applies also to motor tasks {{in which the}} performance of movement brings about a disturbance to balance that is not completely predictable. For example, in bi-manual lifting the pick-up of a load causes a forward shift of the centre of mass with consequent disturbance of posture. Anticipatory postural adjustments are scaled to the expected magnitude of the perturbation and are initiated well before the availability of sensory information characterising the full nature of the postural disturbance. However, when the postural disturbance unexpectedly changes, the anticipatory <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> torques is not equilibrated and {{may result in a}} disturbance to balance. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that apart from anticipatory postural adjustments, corrective responses after load pick-up are used to further compensate the postural disturbance. In this study it was examined whether the central nervous system (CNS) assembles a strategy that incorporates both anticipatory control and corrective responses, in which the magnitude of the anticipatory postural adjustments depends on the perceived level of predictability of the postural disturbance. Subjects performed series of lifts in which the magnitude of the load was never revealed to the subject. Two boxes equal in size and colour, but different in mass (6 and 16 kg), were used. Differences in expectation were created by several lifts with the 16 -kg load before the 6 -kg box was presented. It was observed that the number of strong corrective responses (stepping) varied with the number of 16 -kg trials that formed the prior experience when the final 6 -kg trial was presented. The follow-up question was whether control relied more on anticipation in the stepping trials, compared with trials in which such gross signs of imbalance were absent. In this study it was shown that subjects when stepping (i) exhibited differential anticipatory postural adjustments in comparison with 6 -kg trials in which expectation was not shaped by preceding 16 -kg trials, and (ii) scaled the anticipatory postural adjustments similar to those preceding lift-off of the 16 -kg trial preceding it. These findings emphasise the programmed nature of the anticipatory postural adjustments and the ability of the CNS to selectively tune the anticipatory postural adjustments to stored information gained during the previous lift(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many sport {{activities}} are {{a sequence of}} jumps (running, jumping, hurdling etc.). Each jump flight phase {{is the result of}} the execution of the previous support phase. Objective: The goal of the research was to identify differences in <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the support lower limb and differences in take-off kinematics in specific take-off movement task. Methods: 14 male athletes (22. 6 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 4. 4 &#x 202 F;years; 182. 4 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 5. 3 &#x 202 F;cm; 74. 7 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 6. 2 &#x 202 F;kg) took part in a laboratory experiment. Each athlete performed five different take-off movements (running, acceleration running - second step, long jump take-off, high jump take-off and take-off to the hurdle). System Qualisys was used to analyze the kinematics of the support limb. Dynamics of the support phase was monitored via force plate. ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test were used to measure the significance of the differences between different take off tasks. Results: Dynamic characteristic showed significant differences in take-off (p&#x 202 F;<&#x 202 F;. 001). This variability is caused by differences in kinematic parameters at the instant <b>of</b> touch-down, minimum <b>joint</b> angles and take-off. The most important finding was different variability in range of motion in eccentric or concentric phases of each jump. Vertically orientated jumps are terminated in a higher degree of extension. Horizontal take-off types are characterized by the highest ranges of motion especially in the ankle joint. Conclusions: The support lower limb compliance is adjusted to the required task, which is related to lower limb kinematics during the support phase. High range of motion in each joint refers to more compliant <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>joint...</b>|$|R

Purpose: Many {{studies have}} shown the effect of {{treatment}} of the cervical spine on parts distant to the spine itself, which are linked anatomically, biomechanically or neurologically, e. g. the temporomandibular joint (Curl, 1994). Curl (1994) reports a neurological link between the cervical spine and the temporomandibular joint, and Reggars (1994) reports a biomechanical link between the temporomandibular joint and cervical spine. These links may affect the cervical spine when adjusting the temporomandibular joint. For these reasons, further study is necessary to establish the possibility <b>of</b> temporomandibular <b>joint</b> involvement {{in the formation of}} neck pain, and the possibility of chiropractic manipulative therapy delivered to the temporomandibular joint as a successful alternative treatment for neck pain.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for computing joint state, smoothed, density estimates for non-linear dynamical systems in a Bayesian setting. Many visual tracking {{problems can be}} formulated as probabilistic inference over time series, {{but we are not}} aware of mixture smoothers that would apply to weakly identifiable models, where multimodality is persistent rather than transient (e. g. monocular 3 D human tracking). Such processes, in principle, exclude iterated Kalman smoothers, whereas flexible MCMC methods or sample based particle smoothers encounter computational difficulties: accurately locating an exponential number <b>of</b> probable <b>joint</b> state modes representing high-dimensional trajectories, rapidly mixing between those or resampling probable configurations missed during filtering.

40|$|Abstract Background The rear-wheel camber, {{defined as}} the {{inclination}} of the rear wheels, is usually used in wheelchair sports, but {{it is becoming increasingly}} employed in daily propulsion. Although the rear-wheel camber can increase stability, it alters physiological performance during propulsion. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of rear-wheel cambers on temporal-spatial parameters, joint angles, and propulsion patterns. Methods Twelve inexperienced subjects (22. 3 ± 1. 6 yr) participated in the study. None had musculoskeletal disorders in their upper extremities. An eight-camera motion capture system was used to collect the three-dimensional trajectory data of markers attached to the wheelchair-user system during propulsion. All participants propelled the same wheelchair, which had an instrumented wheel with cambers of 0 °, 9 °, and 15 °, respectively, at an average velocity of 1 m/s. Results The results show that the rear-wheel camber significantly affects the average acceleration, maximum end angle, trunk movement, elbow joint movement, wrist joint movement, and propulsion pattern. The effects are especially significant between 0 ° and 15 °. For a 15 ° camber, the average acceleration and joint peak angles significantly increased (p Conclusions The rear-wheel camber affects propulsion patterns and <b>joint</b> range <b>of</b> motion.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the ability of senior {{students}} within a chiropractic educational setting to apply a scholarly approach to identifying and describing myofascial trigger points and mechanical low back pain. Clinical features: 6 patients with a median age of 21 years consulted the RMIT University chiropractic teaching clinics with uncomplicated subacute mechanical low back pain and were treated with spinal manipulation and trigger point therapy. Intervention and Outcomes: All cases were assessed for change in the prevalence of trigger points by the Specified Myofascial Trigger Point Count (SMTPC). Low back pain and functional disability were evaluated using the Modified Oswestry Questionnaire, Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale (QVAS) and the Modified-Modified Schober¿s Technique. Monitoring was completed prior to commencement of therapy and after 6 treatments provided on a weekly basis. Spinal manipulative therapy included high-velocity, low-amplitude chiropractic <b>adjustments</b> to areas <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> dysfunction and myofascial trigger point therapy in the form of static digital compression.

The participants were recruited randomly and placed in 3 different groups. Participants in group 1 were treated with an <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the sacroiliac <b>joint,</b> as well as needling of the most prominent gluteus medius trigger point. Participants in group 2 were adjusted only and participants in group 3 were needled only. The treatment of the participants took place at the University of Johannesburg’s chiropractic day clinic. The objective data was acquired using a Digital Inclinometer to measure the ranges of motion at the spinal levels of the 5 th lumbar vertebra and the first sacral vertebra (L 5 / S 1). An Algometer was used to measure the amount of pressure required to evoke pain, within the most prominent trigger point being treated. The subjective data was acquired using the Oswestry Pain and Disability Questionnaire, as well as the Numerical Pain Rating Scale. The results of the trial were of no statistical significance, but clinical improvement in both objective and subjective data was found. Group 2 ’s mean value percentage improvement was the greatest, when looking at range of motion. Group 1 ’s mean value percentage improvement was the greatest, with the Algometer and the subjective readings.
