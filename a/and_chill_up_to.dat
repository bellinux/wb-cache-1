The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] largest known Quaternary silicic lava body in the world is Cerro Chao in north Chile, a 14 -km-long coulée with a volume of at least 26 km³. It is the largest of a group of several closely similar dacitic lavas erupted during a recent (< 100, 000 year old) magmatic episode in the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC; 21 - 24 °S) of the Central Andean Volcanic Zone. The eruption of Chao proceeded in three phases. Phase 1 was explosive and produced ∼ 1 km³ of coarse, nonwelded dacitic pumice deposits and later block and ash flows that form an apron in front of the main lava body. Phase 2 was dominantly effusive and erupted ∼ 22. 5 km³ of magma {{in the form of a}} composite couleé covering ∼ 53 km² with a 400 -m-high flow front and a small cone of poorly expanded pumice around the vent. The lava is homogeneous with rare flow banding and vesicular tops and selvages. Ogives (flow ridges) reaching heights of 30 m form prominent features on its surface. Phase 3 produced a 6 -km-long, 3 -km-wide flow that emanated from a collapsed dome. Ogives are subdued, and the lava is glassier than that produced in previous phases. All the Chao products are crystal-rich high-K dacites and rhyodacites with phenocrysts of plagioclase, quartz, hornblende, biotite, sphene, rare sanidine, and oxides. Phenocryst contents reach 40 – 60 vol % (vesicle free) in the main phase 2 lavas but are lower in the phase 1 (20 – 25 %) and phase 3 (∼ 40 %) lavas. Ovoid andesitic inclusions with vesicular interiors <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> margins <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 cm are found in the later stages of phase 2 and compose <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5 % of the phase 3 lava. There is little evidence for preemptive zonation of the magma body in composition, temperature (∼ 840 °C), fO₂ (10 ⁻¹¹), or water content, so we propose that eruption of the Chao complex was driven by intrusion of fresh, hot andesitic magma into a crystallizing and largely homogeneous body of dacitic magma. Morphological measurements suggest that the Chao lavas had internal plastic viscosities of 10 ¹⁰ to 10 ¹²Pa s, apparent viscosities of 10 ⁹ Pa s, surface viscosities of 10 ¹⁵ to 10 ²⁴ Pa s, and a yield strength of 8 × 10 ⁵ Pa. These estimates indicate that Chao would have exhibited largely similar rheological properties to other silicic lava extrusions, notwithstanding its high phenocryst content. We suggest that Chao's anomalous size is a function of both the relatively steep local slope (20 ° to 3 °) and the available volume of magma. The eruption duration for Chao's emplacement is thought to have been about 100 to 150 years, with maximum effusion rates of about 25 m³ s⁻¹ for short periods. Four other lavas in the vicinity with volumes of ∼ 5 km³ closely resemble Chao and are probably comagmatic. The suite as a whole shares a petrologic and chemical similarity with the voluminous regional Tertiary to Pleistocene ignimbrites of the APVC and may be derived from a zone of silicic magmatism that is thought to have been active since the late Tertiary. Chao and the other young lavas may represent either the waning of this system or a new episode fueled by intrusions of mafic magma...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve our}} {{understanding}} of the mechanism of chilling injury in chill-sensitive callus (Cornus stolontfera), early changes in cell permeability and respiratory activity were studied. Partial leakage of amino acids and an abrupt increase in permeation and oxidation of added dopamine were characteristic of chilled callus in the late stage of chilling at 0 °C (48 hr), when most of the callus sustained severe injury. However, little or no change in cell permeability was observed in the early stage of chilling (within 24 hr), when calli retained their viability for growth after transfer to a warm temperature. These results suggest that changes in the cell membranes per se are by no means the pri-mary step in cell injury. Temporary depression of respiratory activity was detected soon after chilling for 12 hr, but activity appeared to return to the original level on further <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 24 hr.

The temperature of the breast muscle before <b>and</b> after <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle after combined chilling method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and after cutting were <b>chilled</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a temperature below 4 °C.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chilling}} on photosystem II (PSII) efficiency was {{studied in the}} variegated leaves of Calathea makoyana, {{in order to gain}} insight into the causes of chilling-induced photoinhibition. Additionally, a relationship was revealed between (<b>chilling)</b> stress <b>and</b> variation in photosynthesis. Chilling treatments (5 degrees C and 10 degrees C) were performed for different durations (1 - 7 d) under a moderate irradiance (120 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)). The individual leaves were divided into a shaded zone <b>and</b> two illuminated, <b>chilled</b> zones. The leaf tip and sometimes the leaf base were not chilled. Measurements of the dark-adapted F-v/F-m were made on the different leaf zones {{at the end of the}} <b>chilling</b> treatment, <b>and</b> then for several days thereafter <b>to</b> monitor recovery. <b>Chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 d in the dark did not affect PSII efficiency and visual appearance, whereas chilling in the light caused severe photoinhibition, sometimes followed by leaf necrosis. Photoinhibition increased with the duration of the chilling period, whereas, remarkably, chilling temperature had no effect. In the unchilled leaf tip, photoinhibition also occurred, whereas in the unchilled leaf base it did not. Whatever the leaf zone, photoinhibition became permanent if the mean value dropped below 0. 4, although chlorosis and necrosis were associated solely with chilled illuminated tissue. Starch accumulated in the unchilled leaf tip, in contrast to the adjacent chilled irradiated zone. This suggests that photoinhibition was due to a secondary effect in the unchilled leaf tip (sink limitation), whereas it was a direct effect of <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> irradiance in the chilled illuminated zones. The PSII efficiency and its coefficient of variation showed a unique negative linearity across all leaf zones and different tissue types. The slope of this curve was steeper for chilled leaves than it was for healthy, non-stressed leaves, suggesting that the coefficient of variation may be an important tool for assessing stress in leaves...|$|R
40|$|Woody {{perennial}} plants including blackberries (Rubus subgenus Rubus Watson) require certain amounts of chilling or rest hours below 7 T during the dormant season for successful bud break the following year. Blackberry cultivars developed in Arkansas are being grown in various climates worldwide, and all cultivars need chilling requirement estimates for accurate recommendations of adaptation. Determining chilling requirements using stem cuttings collected from field-grown plants rather than whole plants is a desirable system. We {{conducted a study}} to evaluate both artificial- and field-chilling of six cultivars. For the artificial-chilling study, 12 -node stem cuttings were collected 2 days after the first killing frost. These were then placed in a moist medium in a walk-in cooler at 30 C. At- 100 hour chilling intervals, five cuttings of each cultivar were placed under an intermittent mist system. For the field-chilling study, a biophenometer {{was placed in the}} field to measure <b>chill,</b> <b>and</b> ten 12 -node stem cuttings of each cultivar were collected at 100 -lwur intervals of <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1000 hours below 72 ̆ 7 C and placed under intermittent mist. For both studies the mist bench was located in a heated greenhouse (min. temperature of 15 T), and cuttings were placed according to a completely random design. Bud break was recorded weekly. Studies were analyzed separately by SAS. Results for Study One, artificial chilling, were inconclusive {{due to a lack of}} clear differentiation among the cultivars <b>and</b> their <b>chilling</b> intervals. Study Two, using field-chilling, showed a significant chilling-interval x cultivar interaction. 2 ̆ 7 Arapaho 2 ̆ 7 appeared to have a chilling requirement of 400 to 500 hours, 2 ̆ 7 Kiowa 2 ̆ 7 200 hours, 2 ̆ 7 Shawnee 2 ̆ 7 400 to 500 hours. and 2 ̆ 7 Chickasaw 2 ̆ 7 probably near that of Shawnee.

Membrane permeabilization induced by cold shock was assessed by uptake of the fluorescent dye 1 -N-phenylnapthylamine. Slow chilling (2 degrees C min(- 1)) did not induce transient susceptibility to nisin. Combining rapid chilling (2, 000 degrees C min(- 1)) and nisin causes a dose-dependent reduction in the population of cells in both exponential and stationary growth phases. A reduction of 6 log of exponentially growing cells was achieved with rapid chilling {{in the presence of}} 100 IU ml(- 1) nisin. Cells were more sensitive if nisin was present during stress. Nevertheless, addition of nisin to cell suspension after the rapid <b>chilling</b> produced <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5 log of cell inactivation for exponentially growing cells and 1 log for stationary growing cells. This suggests that the rapid chilling strongly damaged the cell membrane by disrupting the outer membrane barrier, allowing the sensitization of E. coli to nisin post-rapid chilling. Measurements of membrane permeabilization showed a good correlation between the membrane alteration and nisin sensitivity. Application involving the simultaneous treatment with nisin and rapid cold shock could thus be of value in controlling Gram negatives, enhancing microbiological safety and stability...|$|R

Losses in unsaturation of tissue phospholipids were first observed only after chilling for 7 days. Phospholipase D activity appeared to be potentiated in fruits rewarmed after 7 days of chilling as indicated by a decrease in phosphatidylcholine (and secondarily phosphatidylethanolamine) with a corresponding increase in phosphatidic acid.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Dormancy of 'Pinot Noir' grapevines was characterized. Primary buds {{required}} ca 300 cumulative chilling hours (CCH) {{to initiate}} the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy, which occurred in mid November. Additional <b>chilling,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1000 CCH, improved budbreak. Changes in bud water content were estimated by gravimetric and spectroscopic methods. Total, intra-, and extracellular water were measured gravimetrically. The total water and the intracellular fraction increased during the ecodormant period. A method to evaluate bud water status by proton-nuclear magnetic resonance was developed. Grape buds present anisotropic behavior. Using this method, water content was partitioned into free and bound fractions. Free water was always larger than bound water. Furthermore, bound water reached its peak in January when ecodormant plants were exposed to colder temperatures. These results support former evidence that bound water is composed of one population with restricted mobility, and another in a transient state. Respiration pattern of overwintering buds was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. Endodormant buds decreased their respiration. In February, an increase in respiration, typical of the period preceding budbreak, was observed in ecodormant buds. Ecodormant and breaking buds were classified into four developmental stages. Those stages were: ecodormant, initial swelling, fully swollen, and broken buds. Isothermal experiments at 25 °C were done to evaluate metabolic heat rate, CO₂ evolution rate, and metabolic efficiency. Also, buds were scanned from 1 to 60 °C (7 °C/hr) to estimate activation energy and Q₁₀ values. Metabolic heat rates were 5, 17, 28, and 29 μW/mg dw, respectively, for the four bud developmental stages listed above. In the same order, CO₂ evolution increased from 2 to 3, 6, and 7 /μW/mg dw. The efficiency of metabolism, however, decreased during the initial swelling stage. High apparent activation energy values for ecodormant and initial swelling buds showed that metabolism at those stages is slow, mostly because it is energetically expensive. As the buds developed, activation energy decreased, indicating a more favorable condition from a thermodynamic standpoint. Q₁₀ values demonstrated that grapevines are highly responsive to temperature. Water content and respiration activity are useful indicators of metabolic activity...|$|R

Storage method played a larger role in quality loss than capture conditions. Refrigerated brine produced the best quality swordfish when the machinery functioned properly closely followed by RSW. Ice slurry chilling of large fish such as swordfish exhibited initial delays in the reduction of core temperature which led to lower quality. This method could be improved with the addition of mechanical circulation.

Immediate sample separation or rapid transport of chilled blood samples {{to a central}} laboratory may be impractical or prohibitively expensive. To assess the feasibility and reliability of transporting blood samples over several days at ambient temperature (e. g. by mail), we evaluated the stability of various plasma analytes in samples stored at room temperature or chilled. METHODS: Multiple vacutainers of blood, containing EDTA and aprotinin as preservative, were drawn from 12 volunteers and stored at 21 degrees C or 4 degrees C. Immediately after collection and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days later, vacutainers stored at each temperature were centrifuged, and the plasma was aliquoted and stored at - 80 degrees C. Subsequently, all aliquots from each individual were analysed in one analytical run {{for a range of}} chemistries. RESULTS: In whole blood stored at room temperature for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 days, concentrations of albumin, apolipoproteins A 1 and B (apoA 1 and apoB), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), total protein, and triglycerides changed by less than 4 %, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) by less than 7 %. Whilst alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) concentrations changed substantially at room temperature, there was less than 4 % change during <b>chilled</b> storage <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 days. By contrast, aspartate transaminase (AST) concentrations increased markedly under both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of important analytes, including lipids, change by only a few per cent in whole blood during storage at room temperature for several days. Mailed transport of whole blood samples may, therefore, be a simple and cost-effective option for large-scale {{epidemiological studies}}...|$|R

5000|$|A {{bag-in-box}} or BiB {{is a type}} of {{container for}} the storage and transportation of liquids. It consists of a strong [...] (or plastic bag), usually made of several layers of metallised film or other plastics, seated inside a corrugated fiberboard box. The bag is supplied to the company which will fill it as an empty pre-made bag. The company filling the bag with its product generally removes the tap, fills the bag (with wine, juice or other liquid) and replaces the tap and then the bag is placed in the box. The bags are available as singles for semi-automatic machines or as web bags, where the bags have perforations between each one. These are used on automated filling systems where the bag is separated on line either before the bag is automatically filled or after. Depending on the end use {{there are a number of}} options that can be used on the bag instead of the tap. The bags can be filled from <b>chilled</b> product temperatures <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 85 degrees Celsius.|$|R
