40|$|We {{describe}} a refinement {{of the natural}} partial order {{on the set of}} idempotents of the Motzkin monoid of general degree n which exhibits its structure as a disjoint union of geometric complexes. This leads to an efficient method for computing the numbers of idempotents and their distribution across ranks. The method extends to idempotent numbers in the Jones (or Temperley-Lieb) and Kauffman monoids. Values are tabulated for monoids of small degree in all three of these families. Ramifications are discussed {{in the case of the}} Jones monoids, and include recurrence relations involving exotic Catalan-like return statistics and connexions with meandric numbers.

40|$|Simple closed-box (CB) {{models of}} {{chemical}} evolution are extended on two respects: (i) simple closed-(box+reservoir) (CBR) models allowing gas outflow {{from the box}} into the reservoir or gas inflow into the box from the reservoir with same composition as the preexisting gas and rate proportional to the star formation rate, and (ii) simple multistage closed-(box+reservoir) (MCBR) models allowing different stages of evolution characterized by different inflow or outflow rates. The stellar initial mass function {{is assumed to be}} universal, and mass conservation holds for the whole system (box+reservoir) while it is violated for each subsystem (box and reservoir). The theoretical differential oxygen abundance distribution (TDOD) predicted by the model, under the assumption of instantaneous recycling, is a continuous broken line, where different slopes are related to different inflow rates. For an application of the model (a) a fictitious sample is built up from two distinct samples and taken as representative of the inner Galactic halo, and (b) different [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations are deduced from five different samples related to different methods, and two of them are selected for determining the empirical differential oxygen abundance distribution (EDOD) with regard to the fictitious sample. In both cases the EDOD is represented, to an acceptable extent, as a continuous broken line. If the inner halo and the metal-poor bulge (after the inflow stage) are represented by the box and the reservoir, respectively, then the inner halo fractional mass (normalized to the halo) is comparable with, or exceeds by a factor up to 4, the metal-poor bulge fractional mass (normalized to the bulge), for current estimates of the halo-to-bulge mass ratio of about 0. 05 - 0. 10.

The report also includes susceptibility data on Escherichia coli isolates recovered from retail meats and chickens in 2004. For comparison purposes, summary data from prior years are included. The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System [...] Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) is a national public health surveillance system in the United States that tracks changes in the susceptibility of certain enteric bacteria to antimicrobial agents of human and veterinary medical importance. The NARMS program was established in 1996 as a collaboration between three federal agencies: the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). NARMS also collaborates with scientists involved in antimicrobial resistance monitoring in other countries, including Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, so that information can be shared on the global dimensions of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne bacteria.

40|$|Percolation theory {{concerns}} {{the emergence of}} connected clusters that percolate through a networked system. Previous studies ignored the effect that a node outside the percolating cluster may actively induce its inside neighbours to exit the percolating cluster. Here we study this inducing effect on the classical site percolation and K-core percolation, showing that the inducing effect always causes a discontinuous percolation transition. We precisely predict the percolation threshold and core size for uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. For low-dimensional lattices the percolation threshold fluctuates considerably over realizations, yet we can still predict the core size once the percolation occurs. The core sizes of real-world networks can also be well predicted using degree distribution as the only input. Our work therefore provides a theoretical framework for quantitatively understanding discontinuous breakdown phenomena in various complex systems.
