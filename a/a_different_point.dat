The Rights of Woman {{is a long}} essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of sensibility.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> of view throughout) technology.

5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2015, Amazon Studios {{released}} a pilot {{episode of the}} American adaptation along with their 4th season of new pilots. The adaptation was written by original series creator and writer Cris Cole, who has also signed on for the whole series if it is commissioned. Also, The Shield creator Shawn Ryan joined Cole as an executive producer on the pilot episode. The series stars Michael Imperioli, Billy Zane, Steve Zahn, and Romany Malco, as well as Ben Chaplin, who appeared in the British Mad Dogs series {{in the role of}} Alvo, played by Zane in the US series. The pilot episode is 55 minutes long and has been rated 18, compared to the 15 rating provided to the original series. The American pilot also ends at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> to the original.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern. The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.|$|E

25|$|Since an {{ordinary}} Laplace transform {{can be written}} as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, {{the theory of the}} Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject.

25|$|The {{classification}} of text {{as belonging to}} the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather {{on the degree of}} similarity demanded.

Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren fig tree, in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> of the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there is the}} order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works.

This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> of entry into the path.

Many results known for smooth surfaces and their geodesics, such as Birkhoff's method of constructing geodesics by his curve-shortening process or van Mangoldt and Hadamard's theorem that a simply connected surface of non-positive curvature is homeomorphic to the plane, are equally valid in this more general setting.|$|E
25|$|For a given subject framing {{and camera}} position, the DOF is {{controlled}} by the lens aperture diameter, which is usually specified as the f-number, the ratio of lens focal length to aperture diameter. Reducing the aperture diameter (increasing the f-number) increases the DOF because the circle of confusion is shrunk directly and indirectly by reducing the light hitting the outside of the lens which is focused to <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> than light hitting the inside of the lens due to spherical aberration caused by the construction of the lens; however, it also reduces the amount of light transmitted, and increases diffraction, placing a practical limit {{on the extent to which}} DOF can be increased by reducing the aperture diameter.|$|E
