On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who I am and what I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been <b>amazing.</b> <b>What</b> a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's <b>amazing</b> <b>what</b> your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel." [...] However, Observer television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic: ...|$|E
500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty <b>amazing</b> <b>what</b> he’s done for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 1961, Combs {{appropriated}} $50,000 {{from the}} governor's contingency fund {{to construct the}} clock on the lawn of the state capitol. Combs had seen a similar clock in Edinburgh, Scotland, and believed it would be a colorful addition to the capitol grounds. When construction was completed on the clock, some ridiculed it as [...] "Combs' Folly" [...] or [...] "Big Bert" [...] (an allusion to London's Big Ben). Combs' political foe, A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler, was particularly critical, declaring [...] "It's <b>amazing</b> <b>what</b> some people will think of when they have nothing better to do." [...] In a subsequent gubernatorial campaign, Chandler mocked the clock, declaring [...] "Well, they don't say it's half past 2 in Frankfort anymore. They say it's two petunias past the jimson weed." [...] Chandler's derision became the minority view in time, however; according to journalist John Ed Pearce, the clock {{became one of the most}} talked-about and visited tourist attractions in the state and the most visited place in Frankfort.|$|E

2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was <b>amazing</b> <b>what</b> I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is <b>amazing</b> <b>what</b> he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

5000|$|By 10 o'clock {{the night}} was very dark and cloudy. Across the Ganges in a {{northern}} direction I suddenly saw a large building flooded with golden light.

In the morning I went back to the roof and looked carefully back across the Ganges. I saw that in the place where I had seen the building was a stand of palm trees.
