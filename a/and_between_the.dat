5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries {{focused on}} Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign {{and the events}} surrounding {{the relationship of the}} Duc d'Épernon and Henry III of France, <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Buckingham and Charles I. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, popular historians such as Charles Dickens and Charles Knight popularised Edward's life with the Victorian public, focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons. Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.|$|E
5|$|In 1683, George and his brother, Frederick Augustus, {{served in}} the Great Turkish War at the Battle of Vienna, and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, George Augustus. The {{following}} year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning {{he would no longer}} receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. It led to a breach between father and son, <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, it was {{reported}} that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the pelvic cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the DelDOT {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a future}} north–south limited access highway in Sussex County. The Sussex County North–South Transportation Study explored routes along <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> US13, US113, and DE1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; {{and the ability to}} build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US113 corridor, using as much of the current US113 route as possible. For its standing US113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are bright in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} after Burebista's death <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rule of Domitian and Tiberius, Dacian {{activity}} was minimal. The Dacians {{were forced into}} a defensive state where their main activity was keeping the Romans out of Dacian territories. The regional factions that remained posed no substantial threat to the Roman empire and the Roman sources themselves stop mentioning plans of Roman invasion during this time. Dacian power, resurged during the reigns of Duras – who reigned 68–87 AD – and peaked {{during the reign of}} Decebalus – who reigned from 85/87-106 AD. By this time the Dacian tribes had united once more, under the ruler of Decebalus, and again posed a threat to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor {{for the rest of the}} day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> first and second funnels.
