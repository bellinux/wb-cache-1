40|$|Abstract. Buckling and {{crushing}} behaviour of hollow {{structure was}} studied through experiments and numerical simulation. The experimental material {{was a thin}} <b>aluminium</b> square <b>tube</b> (38 x 38, 1. 2 mm thick). Quasi-static crushing load was applied using a Universal Testing Machine, Shimadzu Autograph (AG-X) series which uses TRAPEZIUMX software for control and data logging. Finite element simulation of the crushing test was done using LS-DYNA software. Results of the two analyses were compared and found in good agreement. The study provides an insight on ways to increasing energy absorption of light weight <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes.</b> The simulation procedure {{can be used for}} further investigation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes</b> of different cross section areas and geometries...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} take better {{advantage}} of passenger traffic, Boeing decided that it needed a larger aircraft that was more suitable for passenger carrying, and in early 1928 designed a trimotor aircraft capable of carrying 12 passengers, the Model 80. Unlike the Fokker F.VII and Ford Trimotors operated by other airlines, the Model 80 was a biplane, chosen to give good takeoff and landing performance when operating from difficult airfields on its routes, {{many of which were}} at relatively high altitude. The fuselage was of fabric covered steel and <b>aluminium</b> <b>tube</b> construction, and carried its 12 passengers in three-abreast seating in a well-appointed cabin. The flight crew of two sat in an enclosed flight deck forward of the passenger cabin. The wings were of fabric covered steel and duralumin construction, with detachable wingtips to aid storage in hangars.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{diameter}} refrigerant paths {{can also}} be realized with extruded <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes.</b> These have been designed with several microchannels in one flat, ribbon-like <b>tube.</b> <b>Aluminium</b> microchannel technology offers significant advantages over conventional copper-aluminium round tube plate fin coil, including improved heat transfer performance and reduced refrigerant charge.However, copper MicroGroove offers higher heat transfer efficiencies than <b>aluminium</b> microchannel <b>tubes</b> and it enables smaller refrigerant volumes because the tube ends of MicroGroove are connected by small U-joints rather than large headers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} impact of {{different}} semi-solid dosage form components on the leaching of Bisphenol A (BPA) and Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) from the epoxy resin-based inner lacquer of <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes,</b> the tubes were filled with different matrix preparations and stored at an elevated temperature. Despite compliance with the European Standards EN 15348 and EN 15766 on porosity and polymerisation of internal coatings of <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes,</b> the commercially available tubes {{used in the study}} contained an increased amount of polymerisation residues, such as unbound BPA, BADGE and BADGE derivatives in the lacquer, as determined by acetonitrile extraction. Storage of Macrogol ointments in these tubes resulted in an almost quantitative migration of the unbound polymerisation residues from the coating into the ointment. In addition, due to alterations observed in the RP-HPLC chromatograms of the matrix spiked with BADGE and BADGE derivatives it is supposed that the leachates can react with formulation components. The contamination of the medicinal product by BPA, BADGE and BADGE derivatives can be precluded by using <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes</b> with an internal lacquer with a low degree of unbound polymerisation residues...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an <b>aluminium</b> <b>tube</b> with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determination}} of formability limit in the tube drawing process was developed using the position controlled mandrel technique. In this method the mandrel has conical angle {{in a way}} that with change of mandrel position, the distance between die and mandrel will be changed and various combinations of thicknesses can be obtained using just one conic mandrel. The advantage of this method is determining the limit cross-sectional reduction for each tube dimension with just one experiment. The realized drawing limit tests on the <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes</b> show that the average maximum area reduction of AA 6063 tubes is about 40 %. An optimal tube drawing schedule for production of the constant wall thickness <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes</b> with high cross-sectional reduction in one pass was successfully established based on the proposed formability limit test.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} further experimental {{investigations into}} axial compression of thin-walled circular tubes, a classical problem studied for several decades. A total of 70 quasi-static {{tests were conducted}} on circular 6060 <b>aluminium</b> <b>tubes</b> in the T 5, as-received condition. The range of D/t considered was expanded over previous studies to D/t= 10 – 450. Collapse modes were observed for L=D 6 10 anda mode classi 5 cation chart developed. The average crush force, FAV, was non-dimensionalisedandan empirical formula establishedas FAV=MP = 72 : 3 (D=t) 0 : 32.

[...] The whole aircraft is built around a long, high aluminium keel boom, which bears the engine, wings and empennage. [...] The wing is a two spar structure, with surfaces formed by upper and lower battens rather than ribs. [...] It carries conventional, full span, tapering ailerons but no flaps. The tailplane is mounted on the keel and has an anti-balance/trim tab on the starboard elevator. [...] There is a small fixed fin below the keel but none above; the rudder is balanced and extends below the elevators, moving in a cut-out.|$|E
2500|$|Flight {{described}} the L.71 as a flying boat on wheels because, in the 1920s, such aircraft were almost the only modern pusher biplanes. Visually, {{the most unusual}} feature was the extreme stagger, introduced to optimise the view {{for each of the}} occupants of its tandem cockpits. [...] Both wings had spruce spars, continuous from tip to tip, and spruce ribs. The larger upper wing had no dihedral but carried the ailerons; the lower wing had 1.5° of dihedral. Outward leaning, <b>aluminium</b> <b>tube</b> N-form interplane struts braced the wings but there was none of the usual flying wire bracing in the single bay; the wings were aerodynamically quite thick, allowing them to be internally braced cantilevers. The upper wing centre section was supported by a shorter pair of outward leaning N struts from the upper fuselage. Though the lower plane was set at mid-fuselage the interplane gap was large, to provide clearance for the two blade propeller.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Sherwood Ranger has an <b>aluminium</b> <b>tube</b> structure, with ply formers and spruce stringers, and is fabric covered {{apart from}} glass fibre mouldings {{in the engine}} and cockpit areas and forming the rear decking.
