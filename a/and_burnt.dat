5|$|Among the 115 species {{recorded}} in 2004 on the site, 15 {{are included in}} the red list of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. In the shrubs near the path where green waste was deposited by people from outside the organization grow yellow club fungus (Clavulinopsis helvola), gray shag (Coprinopsis cinerea), black earth tongues (Trichoglossum hirsutum), Arrhenia spathulata and Marasmius limosus. Those two last species are also in the Calamagrostide's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch, with moor club (Clavaria argillacea), Geoglossum cookeanum, lilac leg fibrecap (Inocybe griseolilacina), (Stropharia pseudocyanea), girdled knight (Tricholoma cingulatum) <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> knight (Tricholoma ustale). Near orchid stations in the pioneer wood exist golden spindles (Clavulinopsis fusiformis), Hebeloma clavulipes, Hebeloma fusipes, Hebeloma pusillum, and also lilac leg fibrecap <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> knight. Dog stinkhorn (Mutinus caninus) and Scytinostroma hemidichophyticum for their part, were observed in the shaded path north of the site on the edge of mature wood.|$|E
5|$|During the 10th and 11th centuries Worcester spread north {{beyond the}} {{original}} burh walls, and south-east to form Sidbury. In 1041 Worcester {{was attacked by}} the royal army of Harthacnut over a tax-dispute that had led {{to the death of}} two of the king's men; despite the defensive walls, the city was successfully taken <b>and</b> <b>burnt.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1927, a {{separate}} restaurant building with place for 700 diners opened. Open only during summer until September, it {{was aimed at}} cruise ship tourists who took the line from Åndalsnes to Bjorli. Operated by Norsk Spisevognselskap, it was highly profitable. However, during the German occupation of Norway in 1940, the building was bombed <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> down, and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E
5|$|In the {{national}} capital, Delhi, {{political and social}} organisations launched street protests <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> Raj's effigy, while members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Poorvanchal cell held a demonstration demanding that the dismissal of the Maharashtra government. In Allahabad, SP workers tried to obstruct the movement of trains in protest. In Uttar Pradesh's capital, Lucknow, Nationalist Congress Party activists burnt an effigy of Raj. In Patna, capital of Bihar, RJD's youth wing staged a demonstration against Raj and the MNS. Thackeray's effigies were burnt also in Jamshedpur {{in the state of}} Jharkhand.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two centuries, the castle was {{involved}} in many conflicts. It was attacked <b>and</b> <b>burnt,</b> probably in the Welsh uprising of 1151, and was captured {{by the forces of}} Llywelyn the Great in 1215. John de Braose acquired the castle in 1220 and repaired it, constructing a stone curtain wall to replace the older defences. Attacked again in 1251, the castle was reinforced with a stone tower {{in the second half of}} the 13th century. It declined in importance during the late-medieval period, and by the 19th century, the castle was ruinous and overgrown with ivy.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian campaign, in 490 BC, {{was under}} the command of Datis and Artaphernes. The {{expedition}} headed first to the island Naxos, which it captured <b>and</b> <b>burnt.</b> It then island-hopped between the rest of the Cycladic Islands, annexing each into the Persian empire. Reaching Greece, the expedition landed at Eretria, which it besieged, and after a brief time, captured. Eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to Attica, landing at Marathon, en route for Athens. There, it was met by a smaller Athenian army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the Battle of Marathon.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Hercule {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} after attempts to board Mars failed. Both ships were battered <b>and</b> <b>burnt,</b> with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90. Hercule was conveyed to Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810. Both L'Héritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle, which is noted as being a very rare example {{during this period of}} an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence.|$|E

5|$|When dawn came, the Megalopolitans {{realised}} {{that the}} Spartans {{had entered the}} city; some of them fled, while others stood and fought against the invaders. Cleomenes' superior numbers forced the defenders to retreat, but their rearguard action allowed most of the population to escape—only 1,000 were captured. Cleomenes {{sent a message to}} Messene, where the exiles had gathered, offering to give back their city if they became his allies. The Megalopolitans refused; in retaliation the Spartans ransacked the city <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> it to the ground. Nicholas Hammond estimated that Cleomenes managed to accumulate around 300 talents of loot from the city.|$|E
5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} Persian army, which {{captured}} <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> Athens. However, {{a larger}} Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of the}} war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E

The only Venetian loss was David Golia, which was burnt. Venetian casualties exclusive of the sunken ship were 126 killed and 180 wounded. 358 Ottomans were taken prisoner.|$|R

5|$|An {{attack by}} sea across Lake Constance on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 {{was one of}} the few {{successful}} Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was taken by surprise, the villages plundered <b>and</b> <b>burnt.</b> A much larger attack of an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long and hard battle. Their general Heinrich von Fürstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy (1135–1153) rival {{factions of}} King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom and Worcestershire {{proved to be}} a key battleground. The first attack on Worcester itself {{occurred}} in late 1139 when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city. After an attempt to take the castle {{on the south side of}} the city, the Gloucester forces entered from the north, looting and burning. Worcester became a base for Stephen's forces for a period, before joining the Empress's faction. In response, Stephen first stormed <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> the city in 1148, and then attacked it again in 1150, shortly before the end of the conflict. From the accounts of these sieges, it appears that Worcester still lacked substantial walls during this period.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Astrid (then {{known as}} W.U.T.A.) {{was sold to}} Swede J. Jeppson and renamed Astrid. Her port of {{registry}} was changed to Skillinge and the Code Letters SLEK were allocated. By this time, she had been derigged and was operating on her engine alone. Astrid was used on trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea until 1975. Astrid then sailed under a Lebanese flag. She was allegedly used for drug smuggling, and was being shadowed in the English Channel by HM Customs and Excise when she mysteriously caught fire. Astrid was found abandoned <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> to a shell {{off the coast of}} England in the early 1980s by Graham Neilson.|$|E

5|$|In 498 BC, {{supported}} by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they {{were followed by}} Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but {{the spread of the}} revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh <b>and</b> <b>Burnt</b> Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century several changes took place, {{with the}} Ballroom {{becoming}} a cinema, until the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings became the owners in 1931. The building was restored by A Mowbray Green in 1938, with Oliver Messel as the interior designer. During the Bath Blitz of 25/26 April 1942, {{one of the}} retaliatory raids on England by the Baedeker Blitz following the RAF's raid on Lübeck, the Assembly Rooms were bombed <b>and</b> <b>burnt</b> out inside. After the cessation of hostilities in Europe, they were restored by Sir Albert Richardson, with work being completed in 1963. The ballroom ceiling had to be repaired after it collapsed in 1989.|$|E
