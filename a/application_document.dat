2500|$|TVS {{passed the}} quality threshold– indeed, as the {{incumbent}} broadcaster it {{could hardly have}} failed to do as failure would have called the ITC's own regulatory regime into question. The lucrative nature of the TVS contract area made {{it one of the}} most desirable franchises in the UK. Despite preparing vast amounts of audience research, programming proposals and an extremely comprehensive <b>application</b> <b>document</b> for the ITC, the TVS board– now minus its founder James Gatward– calculated that it needed to outbid all opposition to retain its licence. This resulted in the [...] "bid high or die" [...] strategy– in which the management calculated the highest possible bid that TVS could possibly afford. The result of these calculations was a massive £59million per annum payable for the next 10 years. It was the highest bid ever made by any UK television broadcaster.|$|E

50|$|The <b>application</b> <b>document</b> for {{determining}} {{the course of the}} new lines was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Transport in 1994 and the track alignment (including the railway power lines) were confirmed on 23 June 1994; the Federal Environment Ministry endorsed the approval. The selected option, according to Deutsche Bahn, was the shortest route, would have the lowest construction and operating costs and would have the lowest land take. The travel times on the Erfurt-Halle and Erfurt-Leipzig routes would be shortest. The ability to stop at the airport and at the new trade fair and affordable connections to the planned Leipzig/Halle freight transport centre and the Leipzig-Wahren container terminal also favoured the chosen option. The environmental impacts were less than or equivalent to other possible routes. Not least, long-distance trains from the north-west towards Halle/Leipzig and Dresden could use part of the route. As part of the planning work, hundreds of exploratory holes were driven to a depth of up to 70 m.|$|E

30|$|However, {{anonymity}} {{appears in}} stark contrast to the zeitgeist. Millions of individuals increasingly use virtual social networks and similar pages on the internet, where they provide extensive information about themselves—which is moreover often publicly available. The amount of information goes even beyond the amount that is included in very comprehensive <b>application</b> <b>documents.</b> Similarly, in Asian countries such as South Korea, providing very detailed and extensive information in application forms is the standard. On the other hand, there are countries like the United States where applications include much less information than what is typically the case in European countries. Hence, any discussion about anonymous job applications is also related to the question of the optimal amount of information included in <b>application</b> <b>documents.</b>|$|R

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of Knowledge Management System in an organization is to integrate both the tacit and explicit knowledge in one integrated system. Though a lot of organizations have developed their own Information System to capture the explicit knowledge, {{but most of the}} information systems are not knowledge based. The same thing happen when comes to the tacit knowledge, where most of the knowledge portals are just concentrating on the tacit knowledge leaving the explicit knowledge un-captured. This paper then proposes an Integrated Design of Knowledge Management System (KMS). The integrated design of KMS integrates all components of knowledge management system available in the organization. It includes the Knowledge Based Enterprise <b>Application,</b> <b>Document</b> Resource Center, e-learning and Knowledge Portal. All the components will be integrated through an integrated search engine to capture the knowledge. The project has been implemented in e-management environment where it embedded the software in knowledge workers ’ everyday processes and practices. The project has been started i...|$|E
40|$|The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a {{language}} for storing and exchanging structured {{data in a}} sequential format. Though originally designed for the use in document processing, it is by now employed for representation of data in virtually all areas of computing, especially on the Internet. The basis of all XML processing software is an XML parser, which parses a document in XML syntax and exposes it as a document tree to the <b>application.</b> <b>Document</b> processing then basically reduces to tree manipulation. Modern functional programming languages like SML and HASKELL with their treestructured data-types are therefore well-suited for implementing such applications. Nonetheless, the area of XML processing software is dominated by JAVA. Functional programming languages play a minor role, {{partly due to the}} lack of a complete implementation of an XML parser. One of the most important tasks in document processing is querying, that is the extraction of parts of a document that match a structu [...] ...|$|E
