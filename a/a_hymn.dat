5|$|In her puja, Chhinnamasta's {{image or}} her yantra is worshipped, {{along with her}} attendants. The heterodox offerings of Panchamakara– wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and coitus– along with {{mainstream}} offerings such as flowers, light, incense, etc., are prescribed for her worship. A fire sacrifice and repetition of her stotra (hymn of praise) or her nama-stotra (name-hymn) are also prescribed in her worship. The Shakta Pramoda has her sahasranama (thousand name-hymn) {{as well as a}} compilation of her 108 names in <b>a</b> <b>hymn.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} chapter, the {{shortest}} in the Upanishad, {{the students of}} Brahman ask Yajnavalkya to recommend <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> that guides someone to immortality. Yajnavalkya recommends the Satarudriya, the hymn with the hundred names of the god Rudra. This hymn is found in sections 16.1 to 16.66 of the Vajasaneyi Samhita in Yajurveda, and is conceived as many epithets of Atman.|$|E

5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship has been much debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E
5|$|The Adhyatma Ramayana, the Mahavira-charita, the Anargharaghava and the Ramacharitamanas do {{not discuss}} the counsel at all and credit Shabari or Shramana or Guha {{as the one who}} leads Rama to Sugriva. In the Adhyatma Ramayana, Kabandha appears from the pyre as a divine being and reveals his true {{identity}} as a cursed gandharva. He further extols Rama in <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> stating that various worlds and deities are embedded in parts of his body and Rama is the Supreme being and then disappears.|$|E
5|$|The Atharvaveda credits {{him of the}} {{invention}} of ploughing and thus, agriculture. He is also described as one who flattened the Earth's rocky surface, thus encouraging agriculture, cattle-breeding, commerce and development of new cities on earth. In <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> in Rigveda, Prithu {{is described as a}} rishi (seer). D. R. Patil suggests that the Rigvedic Prithu was a vegetarian deity, associated with Greek god Dionysus and another Vedic god Soma.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{used the}} tune as a cantus firmus, {{played by a}} trumpet, in an aria of his cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 (1714). He closed his 1723 Christmas cantata Sehet, welch eine Liebe hat uns der Vater erzeiget, BWV 64, with the fifth stanza, and his 1724 cantata Jesus schläft, was soll ich hoffen? BWV 81, with the second stanza. The closing chorale of cantata Bisher habt ihr nichts gebeten in meinem Namen, BWV 87, (1725) is a stanza from <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> by Heinrich Müller on the same tune.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the mundane}} sight of pebbles {{rolling in the}} Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer of}} 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived of it as <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Markendeya Purana praises Varahi as a granter of boons and the regent of the Northern direction, in <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> {{where the}} Matrikas are {{declared}} as the protectors of the directions. In another instance {{in the same}} Purana, she is described as riding a buffalo. The Devi Bhagavata Purana says Varahi, with the other Matrikas, is created by the Supreme Mother. The Mother promises the gods that the Matrikas will fight demons when needed. In the Raktabija episode, Varahi is described as having a boar form, fighting demons with her tusks while seated on a preta (corpse).|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> processional <b>hymn</b> is <b>a</b> chant, <b>hymn</b> {{or other}} music sung during the Procession, usually {{at the start}} of a Christian service, {{although}} occasionally during the service itself. The procession usually contains members of the clergy and the choir walking behind the processional cross. Occasionally, a service will also contain <b>a</b> recessional <b>hymn,</b> although in the Protestant tradition this is usually an organ voluntary.|$|R
5|$|The {{funerals}} {{were held}} in Scotland with John and Joseph McCaig buried together in Ayr. Their older brother, serving with the Royal Marines in Singapore, was flown home for the service. That day, 20,000 people attended rallies in Belfast and Carrickfergus. In Belfast, the cenotaph at the City Hall {{was the focus of}} the mourning with 10,000 people attending including workers from factories in a gathering that stopped the traffic in the city centre. Many wept openly. The Reverend Ian Paisley led the mourners in laying dozens of wreaths. The crowd observed a two-minute silence and sang <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> and the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that it is our souls, not our bodies, that we should seek to beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of <b>a</b> <b>hymn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. <b>A</b> <b>hymn</b> in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>hymn</b> singing {{became popular}} {{and a number}} of groups were formed, there was a move towards making the songs {{educational}} instead of keeping them purely devotional. So from 1943, the hymns and hymn groups were called Gyānmālā ("garland of wisdom").|$|R
5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build a fire and sing <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> to guide them back to the shore.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a clock on the tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower. Tenor 28cwt (3,136lb/1,422kg) in C. The {{original}} five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie bells. The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> every four hours, at 8am, noon, 4 and 8pm, with a different hymn tune for {{every day of the}} week. The church is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts {{her to be}} brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly (""). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from <b>a</b> <b>hymn</b> book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
