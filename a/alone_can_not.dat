25|$|Plasma glucose {{is said to}} be {{maintained}} when there is an equal rate of glucose appearance (entry into the blood) and glucose disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point glucose levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of glucose appearance is dictated by the amount of glucose being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) glucose output. Although glucose absorption from the gut is not typically a source of glucose appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) as well as synthesizing new glucose from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called gluconeogenesis. The ability of the liver to release glucose into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme glycogen phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release free glucose. In order for glucose to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic glucose output, it <b>alone</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, glucose levels fall and fatigue sets in. Glucose disposal, {{the other side of the}} equation, is controlled by uptake of glucose at the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased insulin concentrations, muscle increases GLUT4 translocation of and glucose uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research.|$|E

40|$|Sampling {{small scale}} ocean {{turbulence}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in oceanography. The turbulence can be near the noise level of current microscale profiling techniques and these techniques do not provide spatially and temporally dense measurements and can be labor intensive. A 5 beam acoustic Doppler current profiler (VADCP) can more accurately measure three components of fluid velocity in a column. By towing such a device in a sensor platform, called a towfish, one may measure turbulent mixing in a vertical swath of the ocean. If the towfish attitude is not precisely regulated, however, the turbulence measurements can be irreversibly corrupted. A two-part tow that includes a depressor weight between the towing vessel and the towfish can provide some degree of disturbance rejection. Passive devices <b>alone,</b> however, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> meet the performance requirements for measuring ocean turbulence.
