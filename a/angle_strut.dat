40|$|A variational {{model that}} {{describes}} the interactive buckling of a thin-walled equal-leg <b>angle</b> <b>strut</b> under pure axial compression is presented. A formulation combining the Rayleigh-Ritz method and continuous displacement functions is used to derive a system of differential and integral equilibrium equations for the structural component. Solving the equations using numerical continuation reveals progressive cellular buckling (or snaking) arising from the nonlinear interaction between the weak-axis flexural buckling mode and the strong-axis flexural-torsional buckling mode {{for the first time}} - the resulting behaviour being highly unstable. Physical experiments conducted on 10 cold-formed steel specimens are presented and the results show good agreement with the variational model...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, a {{thorough}} review of some typical models adopted {{to represent the}} effect of EBR FRP systems on the shear capacity of RC elements is carried out, by comparing their advantages, their accuracy and also by highlighting their possible weaknesses. Then, more light is shed upon the so-called “variable <b>angle</b> <b>strut</b> model”, commonly adopted in RC structures, but whose application in the FRP field raises some concerns. Along the same line, the formulations provided by current Codes {{for the evaluation of}} the shear capacity of FRP-RC elements are widely discussed and proved to overestimate the actual shear capacity. Having assessed some of the shortcomings of such models, an alternative approach is proposed. The final outcome is a revised model for EBR FRP shear-strengthening that accounts for the actual contribution of steel stirrups and FRP strips/sheets to the shear capacity, {{while at the same time}} checking the stress in concrete...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the inelastic buckling of axially loaded pin-ended single angle, tee, and double <b>angle</b> <b>struts</b> is described. A total of 54 struts with modified slenderness ranging from 0 · 33 to 1 · 08 were tested. Specially designed supports allowed the end cross-sections to rotate about the major and minor axes, but prevented twisting about the longitudinal axis. All struts failed in the inelastic range by excessive bending and twisting. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions and with other test results. It is shown that the relevant design rules in the current Australian Standard AS 1250 - 1981 and the AISC Specification are satisfactory for single and double <b>angle</b> <b>struts,</b> but are slightly unconservative for tee struts. Experimental results are compared with the SSRC multiple column curves. It is recommended that Curve 2 be adopted for single and double <b>angle</b> <b>struts</b> and Curve 3 for tee struts...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the correlation of stent <b>strut</b> <b>angle</b> to blood flow and also to determine the flow behavior in stented aneurysm. The computational fluid dynamics was applied to access the changes of velocity and pressure in aneurysms. For this study, there are five stent with the same design but different in <b>strut</b> <b>angle</b> of the stent. The <b>strut</b> <b>angle</b> used in this study was 30 °, 35 °, 35 °, 40 °, 45 ° and 50 °. By using 30 ° of <b>strut</b> <b>angle</b> as the control model and the other angle as the experimental model, there are referred to as type I, type II, type III and type IV. The simulation of the model was studied under incompressible, Newtonian, viscous and non-pulsatile condition. The results for all stents analyzed in the current study showed that the stent with higher angle are more efficient than stent with lower angle. The minimum velocity increased with the implacement of stent type IV which is the higher <b>strut</b> <b>angle.</b> Meanwhile, for the pressure distribution of all type of stents indicate that lowest peak pressure obtained by stent type III. Therefore, <b>strut</b> <b>angle</b> used should be suitable to satisfy the requirement of lowest peak pressure and highest minimum velocity.

40|$|Objectives: The angled {{blade plate}} {{has been the}} {{historical}} standard in fixed-angle extramedullary subtrochanteric femur fracture fixation, but it requires an extensile lateral approach to the femur. Little formal evaluation exists for specifically designed percutaneous extramedullary implants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 locked plating constructs, all with percutaneous insertion capability, with the standard 95 -degree angled blade plate to determine whether specifically designed fixed-angle extramedullary implants for subtrochanteric femur fractures were biomechanically comparable to the angled blade plate. Methods: Forty composite adult femurs were divided into 4 equal groups. The constructs evaluated included a 95 -degree angled blade plate, a broad 4. 5 -mm combination locking plate, and a precontoured proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) with and without an oblique, <b>angled</b> <b>strut</b> or ‘‘kickstand’’screw.

40|$|Internal weapons bays are {{becoming}} increasingly common on aircraft for reasons of stealth and aerodynamic performance, and {{will be even more}} prevalent on coming generations of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). Wind tunnel testing of store releases to assess forces and moments for safety and clearance must be conducted with a store mounted to an <b>angled</b> <b>strut</b> rather than a conventional rear sting, to allow the full range of motion as the store "drops" from inside the aircraft. Interference from this strut can disrupt the flowfields and thus the reliability of moments obtained, and therefore an investigation was conducted to quantify the potential extent of discrepancies; original small-scale transonic wind tunnel testing was undertaken in a limited program which was supported by extensive numerical work. It was concluded that the precise geometry of the strut/store interface was of critical importance, with a typical design producing non-linear interference at high angles of attack.

The previous code was following the working stress method (WSM) whereas the revised code {{is based on the}} Limit State Method (LSM). The revised code was drafted incorporating the knowledge gained about the behaviour of members and systems over the years. Original research was carried out to arrive at suitable provisions, where required. The new code addresses the phenomena of shear lag in tension members and block shear failure in their connections. It tackles the effect of initial imperfections and residual stresses in compression members by advocating the use of multiple column strength curves. The flexural-torsional buckling of <b>angle</b> <b>struts</b> connected by one leg is taken care of by an equivalent slenderness approach.

40|$|Aerojet is {{currently}} executing two Strutjet propulsion contracts: one a Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine for a NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Reusable Transportation Technology (ARTT) program, the second a Dual Mode Ram/Scramjet engine for a USAF Wright Laboratories Storable Fuel Scramjet Flow Path Concepts program. The engines employed in both programs operate at supersonic and low hypersonic speeds and use inlets employing forebody external and sidewall compression. Aerojet has developed and validated a successful design methodology applicable to these inlet types. Design features include an integrated vehicle forebody, external side compression struts, strut sidewall and throat bleed, a throat shock trap, and variable geometry internal contraction. Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) predictions and test data show these inlets allow substantially increased flow turning angles over other designs. These increased flow turning angles allow shorter and lighter engines than current designs, {{which in turn}} enables higher performing vehicles with broad operating characteristics. This paper describes the designs of two different inlets evaluated by the NASA-MSFC and USAF programs, discusses the results of wind tunnel tests performed by NASA-Lewis Research Center, and provides correlations of test data with CFD predictions.

40|$|AbstractTitanium and its alloys are {{successfully}} used in aerospace through to marine applications. Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing technique, which promises to allow production of novel Ti structures. However, {{there is still}} a paucity of accepted methods for quantifying build quality. The viability of using X-ray microtomography (μCT) to quantify and track changes in morphology of SLM Ti porous structures at each stage of the post-laser melting production was tested, quantifying its quality through process. Quantification was achieved using an accessible volume tool to determine pore and strut sizes. Removal of partially sintered struts by cleaning was visualised and quantified. Eighty-eight percent of the struts broken by the cleaning process were found to have connecting neck diameters of less than 180 μm with a mean of 109 μm allowing build criteria to be set. Tracking particles removed during cleaning revealed other methods to improve build design, e. g. avoiding low <b>angle</b> <b>struts</b> that did not sinter well. Partially melted powder particles from strut surfaces were quantified by comparing surface roughness values at each cleaning step. The study demonstrates that μCT provides not only 3 D quantification of structure quality, but also a feedback mechanism, such that improvements to the initial design can be made to create more stable and reliable titanium structures {{for a wide variety of}} applications...|$|R

These elements {{may be subject}} to only shear, pure torsion or both, torsion and shear combined. The Brazilian Standard Code ABNT NBR 6118 : 2007 [1] fixes conditions to calculate the transverse reinforcement area in beam reinforced concrete elements, using two design models, based on the strut and tie analogy model, first studied by Mörsch [2]. The <b>strut</b> <b>angle</b> &# 952; (theta) can be considered constant and equal to 45 º (Model I), or varying between 30 º and 45 º (Model II). In the case of transversal ties (stirrups), the variation of angle &# 945; (alpha) is between 45 º and 90 º. When the equilibrium torsion is required, a resistant model based on space truss with hollow section is considered. The space truss admits an inclination angle &# 952; between 30 º and 45 º, in accordance with beam elements subjected to shear.
