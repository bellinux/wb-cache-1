5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense.

Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>that</b> could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>that</b> combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The Clock drawing test (CDT) {{is a brief}} {{cognitive}} {{task that}} can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination.

25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>that</b> the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E
25|$|While {{creosote}} treated wood is {{no longer}} used {{in the building of}} structures and piers, old broken down piers still could contain these creosote preservatives. Many properties contain piers that were built before 2008 with creosote preservatives, and now remain in the water even if they are broken down. One simple remedy for this would be removing the pilings after they are broken down or are no longer in use. On the coast, after storms pass through, debris and wreckage breaks piers that are built on the water. One of the harder remedies is for pilings that have sunk {{to the bottom of the}} water and settled on the sediment. These pilings are not visible and are harder to detect. The pilings will then sit on the bottom and leach chemicals out into the sediment and ecosystem. A solution to the problem of hidden pilings could be an analytical method or technique that could be used to track creosote compounds or byproducts in situ (the original place of contamination). If there was a technique that could be used out in the field that could trace higher concentrations of the chemical in the sediment, then hidden pilings could be isolated and removed from the environment. Many methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), have been used to identify creosote preservatives in the ground water and sediment, but most methods must be taken back to the lab in order to be properly conducted due to the run time and size of the instrument. New studies have shown that the use of smaller, more user friendly bio-assays are available to researchers so they can be used in the field for faster identification of chemical compounds. <b>A</b> <b>test</b> <b>that</b> could identify creosote compounds or other toxic byproducts quickly and efficiently in the field would allow researchers to remove contaminated pilings before further damage can be done.|$|E
