40|$|In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have {{polarized}} {{the interest}} of the scientific community as a new category of gene expression regulators, present in both plants and animals. Plant miRNAs are involved in processes such as plant development, organ identity, and stress response. Nonetheless, knowledge of their functions is still incomplete, and it is conceivable that further new processes in which they are involved will be discovered. For these reasons, structural and functional characterization of MIR genes, that are also in crop species such as Zea mays L., becomes instrumental in addressing genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling phenotype determination and phenotypic <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The present study contributes to the characterization of five miRNA families in maize, from the determination of their expression pattern in different maize tissues and genotypes, to the identification of putative targets by bioinformatic means and subsequent experimental validation of three targets by modified 59 RACE experiments. Furthermore, 30 different MIR genes belonging to these five miRNA families were analysed by their attribution to maize chromosomes using oat– maize addition lines and by investigating their phylogenetic relationship with genes from other cereals. In particular, sequence homology was determined by the reciprocal best BLAST hit approach, to define groups of homologous genes between maize, rice, and sorghum...|$|E
40|$|In {{the lowland}} regions of Latin America, a large {{proportion}} of beans are sown {{at the beginning of a}} dry season where a guaranteed terminal (end-of-season) drought will reduce yields. This study was undertaken to identify lines within two black bean recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations with resistance to terminal drought. The two RIL populations were developed from crosses between a drought resistant line, B 98311 from Michigan, with TLP 19 and VAX 5, two lines from CIAT with improved disease resistance and <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> in Latin America. The RIL populations were evaluated in experiments conducted in Zamorano, Honduras and Veracruz, Mexico under drought stress and well-watered (non-stress) treatments. Yields were reduced in each experiment by drought and the fungal pathogen, Macrophomina phaseolina. Drought stress, disease pressure and low yields contributed to high coefficients of variation (CV), which made it difficult to select superior lines. Selection was based on rank of geometric mean (GM) yield calculated from the yield in the stress and non-stress treatments. One RIL, L 88 - 63, ranked first in GM yield at both locations. Subsequent testing in Honduras and Michigan confirmed the high yield potential and broad adaptation of L 88 - 63. Breeding beans for drought resistance in lowland tropical environments should also include breeding for resistance to M. phaseolina...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Food Science, Washington State UniversityQuinoa is a grain {{that has}} {{garnered}} increasing interest {{in recent years}} from global markets, {{as well as in}} academic research. The studies in this dissertation focused on quinoa seed quality and sensory evaluation among diverse quinoa varieties with potential <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> in Washington State. The objectives in the dissertation were to study quinoa seed quality, as well as the sensory attributes of cooked quinoa as defined by both trained and consumer panelists. Regarding quinoa seed quality, we investigated seed characteristics (diameter, weight, density, hardness, seed coat proportion), seed composition (protein and ash content), flour viscosity and thermal properties, quinoa cooking quality, and texture of cooked quinoa. Additionally, the functional characteristics of quinoa were studied, including the determination of amylose content, starch swelling power and water solubility, texture of starch gel, and starch thermal properties. Results indicated texture of cooked quinoa was significantly influenced by protein content, flour viscosity, quinoa cooking quality, amylose content, and starch enthalpy. In addition, the influences of soil salinity and fertility on quinoa seed quality were evaluated. The variety ‘QQ 065 ’ exhibited increased protein content and maintained similar levels of hardness and density under salinity stress, and is considered to be the best adapted variety among four varieties. Finally, sensory evaluation studies on cooked quinoa were conducted. A lexicon of cooked quinoa was developed including the sensory attributes of aroma, taste/flavor, texture, and color. Results from the trained and consumer panel indicated that consumer liking of quinoa was positively influenced by grassy aroma, and firm and crunchy texture. These results represent valuable information to quinoa breeders in the determination of seed quality of diverse quinoa varieties. In the food industry, the results of seed quality and sensory studies (lexicon and consumer-liking) can be utilized to evaluate quinoa ingredients from multiple locations or years, determine the efficiency of post-harvest processing, and develop appropriate products according to the properties of the specific quinoa variety. Overall, this dissertation contributed to the growing body of research describing the chemical, physical and sensory properties of quinoa. Food Science, Washington State Universit...|$|E

Over two growing seasons (2007 - 2008), apple trees growing in a large weighing lysimeter were used to measure daily canopy transpiration (Td). Seasonal patterns of daily canopy intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPARd) and midday stem water potential were also measured. In 2007, irrigation was withheld in two different times to study Td responses to midday stem water potential. Before harvest, under full irrigation, Td increased linearly with IPARd (R 2 = 0. 81 in 2007 and 0. 84 in 2008). With the two year data combined, R 2 increased from 0. 74 to 0. 80 when VPD was considered as a second variable. When irrigation was withheld in 2007 the ratio between Td and IPARd, which is defined here as transpiratory radiation use efficiency (TRUE), decreased linearly (R 2 = 0. 49) as midday stem water potential decreased.

However, future growth rates could decline if U. S. agriculture does not sufficiently adapt to climate change. We examine the magnitudes of weather impacts on U.

40|$|Naked oat is an under-utilised crop, which {{contributes}} {{less than}} 0. 1 % {{to the total}} oat acreage in Finland. Such low area under naked oat compared to conventional indicates, however, the potential for more comprehensive production. Limited interest in growing naked oat more extensively is attributed to its weaknesses, which ironically result from nakedness that is the factor making naked oat also an exceptionally attractive crop. To be able to weight the potentiality of naked oat, an analysis of weaknesses, strengths, opportunities and threats (SWOT) was carried (Peltonen-Sainio et al. 2004). Based on the relevant literature and our own experiences in growing and handling naked oat we {{ended up in the}} following results of SWOT-analysis: Strengths are 1) experience and long traditions in cultivating oat in Finland, 2) <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> northern <b>growing</b> <b>conditions,</b> 3) crop management comparable to that in conventional oat, 4) exceptionally high quality grain and 5) storability; Weaknesses are 1) need for compensating the reduced seed vigour by using 10 % higher seeding rate, 2) sensitivity to grain damage caused by mechanical stress and 3) incomplete expression of nakedness; Opportunities are 1) potential substitute for imported energy, 2) potential for specific, high value applications, 3) potential for future breeding success and 4) lack of economic losses related to hulls; Threats are 1) problems in availability regarding modern cultivars for farmers and lot quantities for industry, 2) lack of signs of increasing production intensity and 3) problems in producing high germination seed in northern <b>growing</b> <b>conditions.</b> After weighting all these SWOT-factors thoroughly, we ended up in concluding that naked oat is particularly attractive as on-farm feed in Finland.

At {{the same time}} growth parameters of shoots and roots were measured. It was shown that resistant cultivar reacts on iron deficiency and low pH by alkalization of shoot and root tissues and increase in growth of these organs compared to control. After prolonged growth under these conditions alkalization of shoots and roots was changed to acidification and slowing down of their growth. Nonres istant cultivars quickly undergo tissue acidosis of shoots and roots and slowing down of their growth under iron deficiency and low pH. Alkalization of tissues is considered as nonspecific adaptation reaction of plants on stress-factors and acidification- as a nonspecific destructive process, as responses on high intensity or prolonged action of a stress- factor or at a mild effect of a stress factor at low activity of defense systems. Ratios of pH values of shoot to root tissue homogenates were calculated. They are constant values under normal conditions. They remain constant at increase of age of plants, change insignificantly under <b>adaptation</b> of plants <b>to</b> iron deficiency and low pH and change considerably at development of pathological state of plants.

40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) are trace gases other than CO 2 and CH 4 produced and emitted by the vegetation. The group consists of thousands of compounds in various shapes and sizes and with short atmospheric lifetimes. Some {{of the most common}} BVOC groups are called isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. For the plant, the emission of BVOCs is used for plant communication, attracting pollinators, to deter herbivores and to enhance abiotic stress defense against for example high temperatures, irradiation or oxidative stresses. But once released into the atmosphere, they are affecting the atmospheric chemistry which in effect alters our climate. Depending on the atmospheric composition, BVOC emissions can either enhance tropospheric ozone and indirectly prolong the lifetimes of greenhouse gases such as methane by reducing the concentration of hydroxyl radicals, or increase the formation of aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei which may mitigate the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming. It is fairly well known that BVOCs {{have an impact on the}} climate. However, whether the BVOC emissions have a warming or cooling effect on the overall climate is difficult to determine due to existing emission pattern variations both between individuals of the same species and between species. Some of the reasons which are often discussed to be influential and where there is relatively little data available are within-species genetic variation, stress response, <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> different weather and climatic conditions and seasonality. In this thesis, focus has been given to the importance of genetic diversity and <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> different <b>growing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Studies have been conducted on three European tree species with genetically identical individuals across a latitudinal gradient, stretching from Slovenia to southern Finland. The main results were that even though the emission amounts varied between sites due to differences in weather events, the progression of the growing season and insect outbreaks, the compound composition between individuals were similar both across latitudes and between measurement years. By showing compound composition stability for genetically identical trees, the results highlights the importance of taking genetic diversity into account in terms of observed emission pattern variations. The response to changing light conditions on the emission amount of different compounds was also investigated. The results uncovered that different compounds had different emission responses to changing light conditions, but that the response of the compounds were fairly similar across different species...|$|R
40|$|Propagation {{material}} {{is an integral}} part of the crop produc­ tion chain. The genetic constitution of the cultivar should guar­ atee optimal <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> and a good yield with the desired quality characteristics. Healthy and vig­ orous seeds, seed tubers, or transplants are essential for rapid establishment of the crop. Use of poorly germinating seeds or seed bers infected with pathogens results at least in losses bu t often Ill crop failure. The term "propagation material" refers to seeds and· veg­etatitve material such as seed tubers (e. g., potato), bulbs (e. g., onions, shallots, and some ornamentals), cuttings (trees and shrubs), young plants (transplants) produced from either cut­tings or seeds, and grafted plants (as is common for fruit trees and becoming increasingly important for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucurbits) Although the genetic material used in organic farming i s often the same as that used in con­ ventional production, cultivars with trait 5 that are less impor­ tant or even unwanted in conventional farming are sometimes preferred in organic farming. This holds true, for example, for cultivars that are adapted to the local soils and are resistant to pests and diseases common to the area or for those that exhibit structural features that contribute to disease control or weed suppression. Examples of the latter are tall wheat cultivars that provide greater ground cover or have a higher light interception level or leaf area index than shorter and less competitive culti­ vars (Drews et al., 2009). The use of chemical crop protectants and fertilizers in the production of conventional propagation material has enabled improvement in the quality of seeds and seed tubers, especially in the high-value seed market. Obtain­ ing similar high-quality propagation material under organic production conditions presen ts a challenge, especially with crops for which the seeds are not the product that is normally harvested. The term "vigor" is defined as the potential of seeds to germinate and produce good-quality seedlings, even under suboptimal field conditions. Making nutrients available from organic fertilizers requires microbial activity. With cold soils in the spring, microbial activity is low. In order to mobilize enough nutrients, the use of highly vigorous seeds that ger­ minate rapidly and produce seedlings with fast-growing root systems is important in establishing a new organic crop. Fewer options for disease control are available in organic farming, so avoidance of seedborne diseases is more important than in con­ ventional crop production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Plant {{registration}} and selection work aimed at identifying the best genotypes for northern landscaping {{has been carried}} out in Finland since the 1980 ’s. In the University of Oulu Botanical Gardens, micropropagation methods have been developed for several woody plant taxa registered during the POHKAS (Northern Hardy Plants) project. Micropropagation is an effective method to conserve valuable genetic characteristics and to produce plantlets from woody species with limited mother stock material and in a limited time period. In this study the long-term field phenology and success of 19 micropropagated shrub and tree taxa was followed in plant selection experiments. Experiments were conducted at four northern field sites presenting different climatic conditions. Of the phenological monitoring parameters, the onset of foliation and flowering in the field revealed a strong relation to spring time temperature, being obviously latest to occur in northernmost site. The gradient between southern and northern sites for autumn phenology was not so obvious. However, between the different genotypes, the greatest differences were observed in the timing of autumn colouration and defoliation. Winter hardiness also showed clear differences between genotypes. Of the success parameters, it was most decisive as winter hardy genotypes had a higher occurrence of flowers and ornamental appearance, for example in Rosa majalis ‘Tornedal’. Some of these hardy genotypes with known characteristics were introduced to northern tourism areas to create examples of sustainable landscaping. Further, a list of potential plants for different northern sites was compiled. Special forms with both scientific and ornamental value are occasionally found in wild species. One example of this is the red-leaved form of a pubescent birch, Betula pubescens f. rubra, which was studied in the plant selection experiments, and was used as a model tree to evaluate the role of anthocyanins in northern plants in a case study of northern birches. In the case study, the red-leaved pubescent birch showed some differences in flavonoid responses and growth rate in comparison to Betula pubescens and Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii. Phenology of the B. p. f. rubra was corresponding to that of the B. pubescens. For cultivated woody plants the most important selection criteria for the northern areas are the suitability to local climate i. e. timing of phenological events and winter hardiness.

The effects of weeding regimes and rice cultivars on weed growth and rice yield were investigated at two upland locations (Abomey-Calavi and Niaouli) in the degraded coastal savanna zone of Benin in 2005 and 2006 with below-average rainfall. Four weeding regimes (hoe weeding at 21 d after sowing [DAS], delayed hoe weeding at 31 DAS, hoe weeding at 21 and 42 DAS, and a no weeding control) were the main plot treatments. Cultivars comprising three interspecific upland rice cultivars (NERICA 1, NERICA 2, and NERICA 7) and the parents (Oryza sativa WAB 56 - 104 and O. glaberrima CG 14) were tested in subplots. The most dominant weed species identified were Jamaican crabgrass, Mariscus, and silver spinach. Rice yield was generally low because of drought stress; none of the experiments had a higher mean yield than 1, 400 kg ha- 1 across cultivars. Across cultivars, the best weeding regimes in terms of weed control and rice yields were single weeding at 31 DAS (W 31) and double weeding at 21 and 42 DAS (W 21 + 42). Under these weeding regimes, WAB 56 - 104 out-yielded the three NERICA cultivars. CG 14 showed the strongest weed suppressive ability (WSA) in Abomey-Calavi but did not have strong WSA in Niaouli because of lower biomass accumulation.

40|$|Crop {{species have}} been deeply {{affected}} by the domestication process, {{and there have been}} many efforts to identify selection signatures at the genome level. This knowledge will help geneticists to better understand the evolution of organisms, and at the same time, help breeders to implement successful breeding strategies. Here, we focused on domestication in the Mesoamerican gene pool of Phaseolus vulgaris by sequencing 49 gene fragments from a sample of 45 P. vulgaris wild and domesticated accessions, and as controls, two accessions each of the closely related species Phaseolus coccineus and Phaseolus dumosus. An excess of nonsynonymous mutations within the domesticated germplasm was found. Our data suggest that the cost of domestication alone cannot explain fully this finding. Indeed, the significantly higher frequency of polymorphisms in the coding regions observed only in the domesticated plants (compared to noncoding regions), the fact that these mutations were mostly nonsynonymous and appear to be recently derived mutations, and the investigations into the functions of their relative genes (responses to biotic and abiotic stresses), support a scenario that involves new functional mutations selected for adaptation during domestication. Moreover, consistent with this hypothesis, selection analysis and the possibility to compare data obtained for the same genes in different studies of varying sizes, data types, and methodologies allowed us to identify four genes that were strongly selected during domestication. Each selection candidate is involved in plant resistance/tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as heat, drought, and salinity. Overall, our study suggests that domestication acted to increase functional diversity at target loci, which probably controlled traits related <b>to</b> expansion and <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> new agro-ecological <b>growing</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of producing open pollinated (O. P) corn varieties as a grain source for the production of specialty whiskies. Low profit margins on corn grain as a commodity make it difficult for small to medium size farmers <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> corn competitively. Such farmers could benefit from a cash crop that could offer a higher profit margin. There is current popular interest in heirloom (old-time) grains, including O. P varieties. This may provide an opportunity for a distiller to develop a market for a specialty whisky using O. P. varieties. An advantage for O. P corn as a specialty crop for corn growers is the similarities in equipment, cultural practices, and inputs. No major conversion is needed. 	Field studies were initiated to determine the production potential and reliability of O. P. varieties in New York environments, and to identify the best varieties. Comparative yield trials were conducted over two growing seasons in various locations. Varieties were selected on the basis of anticipated <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> New York <b>growing</b> <b>conditions,</b> potential for grain production and commercial availability of seed. 	In 2001, seventeen open pollinated varieties along with a modern hybrid check were tested at Aurora, (central) and Kingston, (eastern), NY. In 2002, twenty varieties were planted at Aurora. Those considered earlier varieties were also planted at Bliss, (western). Also, in 2002, later varieties were planted at Kingston, and Pittsford, (western). 	All trials were set up in randomized complete block designs. Treatments consisted of two adjacent rows of each variety with approximately 36 - 40 seeds planted within each block. Each trial consisted of three blocks. The plots were thinned to a density of 18, 000 plants/acre. 	Several major obstacles were observed First, yields of O. P. varieties were lower and more variable than yields of hybrids. The mean corn yield in bushels for New York State is 100. 7 bu/acre (www. nass. usda. gov) averaged over the three years. (1999 - 2001). Many of the varieties in these trials occasionally performed at or above this level, but none consistently, except the hybrid checks. Stalks were also weak, blowing down in winds, and making harvest difficult. Perhaps most significantly, the data showed wide variation in variety performance between years and locations, even among the same varieties. 	Premium alcoholic beverage producers could tolerate high O. P. grain costs if they could develop a market for a high value specialty whiskey featuring an O. P. corn source. However they would need reliable grain supplies. In these studies O. P. corn production was erratic, and not dependable from year to year, or site to site. This lack of dependability would present an unacceptable business risk. One possible solution might be to develop a product based mostly on readily available, inexpensive hybrid corn grain, mixed with a small amount of open pollinated grain. 	If a business plan could be developed that protects against fluctuations of availability, the concept of using O. P. corn to differentiate a small batch premium alcoholic beverage might have potential for success. This could provide employment in the processing, distilling and bottling processes. And O. P corn might provide a profitable niche crop for a limited number of corn growers...|$|R

Another approach to save energy is to lower the greenhouse temperature. To do so cultivars are needed that tolerate lowered temperatures without loss of yield. In this thesis the possibility to breed sweet pepper cultivars for <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> cooler <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> is studied. <b>To</b> this end, the physiology of growth and development of pepper and related Capsicum species were observed on young plants, and the inheritance of growth related traits was analysed. Selection for rapid growth in the vegetative growth phase of Capsicum is most likely an efficient method for the selection of plants with good growth and dry mass production in the generative phase (Chapter 6). To be able to perform repeated non-destructive measurements of leaf area on single plants without harvesting and sacrificing them (Chapter 5), a method was developed to estimate leaf area from non-destructive measurements in C. annuum (Chapter 2). Leaf area could be predicted from the product of leaf length and width (α•L•W); by the addition of both linear and quadratic leaf width terms the model (Area = 0. 61906 •L•W + 0. 2060 •W 2 - 0. 5142 •W) became independent of plant age and accession and could be used for leaf area estimation during the whole vegetative phase {{as well as at the}} start of the generative growth phase of Capsicum. It was demonstrated that this model predicts total plant leaf area accurately, even when the length and width of only 25 % of the leaves were measured. The value of this method was shown in Chapter 5 where a large number of genetically unique F 2 and F 3 plants could be measured several times. In Chapter 3 the influence of lowered temperature on relative growth rate (RGR; increase in dry mass per unit biomass per unit of time) and its underlying physiological and morphological traits are described in a group of wild and cultivated Capsicum accessions, using a growth analysis at two temperature regimes (21. 1 °/ 18. 7 °C and 17. 3 °/ 14. 7 °C; day/night). The growth related traits were net assimilation rate (NAR; increase in dry mass per unit leaf area per unit time), the leaf area ratio (LAR; the leaf area per unit of total plant dry mass), specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area per unit leaf dry mass) and leaf mass fraction (LMF; the fraction of total plant dry mass allocated to the leaves). The relative difference in RGR between plants grown at different temperature conditions was used as a measure for tolerance to lowered temperatures. Based on this difference in RGR, some Capsicum accessions were shown to be better adapted to lowered temperatures than others, indicating an opportunity to breed for lowered temperature tolerance in Capsicum. Under both temperature regimes NAR proved to be the most important factor affecting the variation in RGR among the Capsicum accessions. NAR and LAR were negatively correlated in a group of ten Capsicum accessions. Some accessions combined a relatively high NAR and a relatively high LAR under lowered temperatures resulting in a limited effect of temperature on RGR. Thus, as we argued in Chapter 6, the trade-off between NAR and LAR in many accessions does not exclude the possibility that high LAR and high NAR can be combined, resulting in a single genotype with an increased RGR. Subsequently, we tried to identify which traits can be used to simplify the selection for RGR in breeding programmes (Chapter 4). RGR provides important information about general plant growth and development but is difficult to assess in breeding programs. By identifying physiological and morphological traits that are related with RGR but are easier to obtain than RGR itself, indirect selection for RGR may become feasible in practical breeding. The relationship between RGR and a number of physiological and morphological plant traits (relative leaf growth rate (RLGR), leaf, stem and total fresh and dry mass, plant height, leaf area, number of leaves) was studied in broader collection of Capsicum accessions as well as in a group of sweet pepper cultivars. The relations between RGR and leaf, stem and total fresh and dry mass, plant height, leaf area, number of leaves found in the collection of Capsicum accessions was not found in the group of sweet peppers, limiting the practical use of these traits as a measure for RGR. RLGR, on the other hand, was strongly correlated with RGR. Also, RLGR can be calculated from non-destructive leaf area measurements using the model described in Chapter 2. This makes RLGR a valuable, easy-to-measure trait that can be used as an indirect measure for RGR (Chapter 6). In Chapter 4, we also made a comparison between the variation in the ability to adapt to lowered temperatures in cultivated sweet pepper varieties on the one hand and the variation found in the broader collection of Capsicum accessions studied in Chapter 3 on the other hand; within the group of sweet peppers, the variation for lower temperature tolerance was only limited. We concluded that further exploitation of the genetic variation for lowered temperature tolerance in wild relative Capsicum species is recommendable in order to breed cultivars with increased energy efficiency. The possibility to use this physiological and morphological information on Capsicum in breeding programmes for lowered temperature tolerance is described in Chapter 5. The inheritance of RLGR and several other physiological and morphological plants traits were examined in an intraspecific C. annuum F 2 population. The most important agronomic trait for which a QTL could be identified in the F 2 population and validated in a group of 25 selected F 3 lines was RLGR. In addition, 14 more QTLs related to plant growth and development were identified; the effect of six of them (e. g. leaf mass fraction (LMF), dry mass, number of leaves) could be validated in a set of F 3 lines. In the sweet pepper cultivars studied in Chapter 4 traits of these morphological QTLs were not correlated to RGR and are therefore most likely of limited value with respect to plant growth, although they might be more valuable with respect to plant development. Most important, this study shows that marker assisted selection can be used to breed for growth and development in Capsicum. In short, this thesis presents new knowledge and tools for breeding lowered temperature tolerant sweet pepper cultivars, thus enabling a reduction in energy use and CO 2 emission...|$|R
