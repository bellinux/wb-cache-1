Assisted by several Georgian aristocrats anxious to check Tamar's growing power, Yuri made two coup attempts, but failed <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> obscurity after 1191. The queen chose her second husband herself. He was David Soslan, an Alan prince, to whom the 18th-century Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti ascribes descent from the early 11th-century Georgian king George I. David, a capable military commander, became Tamar's major supporter and was instrumental in defeating the rebellious nobles who rallied behind Yuri.|$|E

[...] Many Phi Sigma Kappa men from Dartmouth went off to war, and at least one spent time as a prisoner of war. When these same brothers returned to finish their education after the war, attitudes in the house were less innocent, which changed how the brotherhood treated one another. [...] Certain pre-war pledge activities, for example, were completely eliminated, as their shock value no longer entertained anyone.|$|E

[...] Hazlitt provides as one notable example Cobbett's brief fondness for some ideas of Thomas Paine. Cobbett even brought Paine's bones back with him from the United States to England, planning to erect a monument. But then his enthusiasm dwindled, and he [...] "ratted from his own project", <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> fight other battles.

2500|$|Hydatius states:"The Huns {{broke the}} peace and plundered the Gallic provinces. A great many cities were taken. On the Catalaunian Plains, {{not far from the}} city of Metz, which they had taken, the Huns were cut down in battle with the aid of God and {{defeated}} by general Aetius and King Theoderic, who had made a peace treaty with each other. The darkness of night interrupted the fighting. King Theoderic was laid low there and died. Almost 300,000 men are said to have fallen in that battle." [...] - Hydatius, Chronicon, 150.Prosper, contemporary to the battle, states:"After killing his brother, Attila was strengthened by the resources of the deceased and forced many thousands of neighboring peoples into a war. This war, he announced as a guardian of Roman friendship, he would wage only against the Goths. But when he had crossed the Rhine and many Gallic cities had experienced his savage attacks, both our people and the Goths soon agreed to oppose with allied forces the fury of their proud enemies. And Aetius had such great foresight that, when fighting men were hurriedly collected from everywhere, a not unequal force met the opposing multitude. Although the slaughter of all those who died there was incalculable – [...] for neither side gave way – it appears that the Huns were defeated in this battle because those among them that survived lost their taste for fighting and turned back home." [...] – [...] Prosper, Epitoma Chronicon, s.a. 451."The battle raged five miles down from Troyes on the field called Maurica in Campania." [...] – [...] Additamenta ad Chronicon Prosperi Hauniensis, s.a. 451."At this time Attila king of the Huns invaded the Gauls. Here trusting in lord Peter the apostle himself patrician Aetius proceeded against him, he would fight with the help of God." [...] – Continuatio Codex Ovetensis."Battle was made in the Gauls between Aetius and Attila king of the Huns with both peoples and massacre. Attila fled into the greater Gauls." [...] – Continuatio Codex Reichenaviensis.The Gallic Chronicles of 452 and 511 state:"Attila entered Gaul as if he had the right to ask for a wife that was owed to him. There, he inflicted and suffered defeat and then withdrew to his homeland." [...] – Chronica Gallica Anno 452, s.a. 451."Patrician Aetius with king Theodoric of the Goths fight against Attila king of the Huns at Tricasses on the Mauriac plain, where Theodoric was slain, by whom it is uncertain, and Laudaricus the relative of Attila: and the bodies were countless. [...] – Chronica Gallica Anno 511, s.a. 451.The Paschale Chronicle, preserving a garbled and abbreviated passage of Priscus, states:While Theodosius and Valentinian, the Augusti, were emperors, Attila, from the race of the Gepid Huns, marched against Rome and Constantinople with a multitude of many tens of thousands. He notified Valentinian, the emperor of Rome, through a Gothic ambassador, [...] "Attila, my master and yours, orders you through me to make ready the palace for him." [...] He gave the same notice to Theodosius, the emperor in Constantinople, through a Gothic ambassador. Aetius, the first man of senatorial rank in Rome, heard the excessive daring of Attila's desperate response <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Alaric in Gaul, who was an enemy of Rome because of Honorius. He urged him to join him in standing against Attila, since he had destroyed many Roman cities. They unexpectedly launched himself against him as he was bivouacked near the Danubios river, and cut down his many thousands. Alaric, wounded by a saggita in the engagement, died.Attila died similarly, carried off by a nasal hemorrhage while he slept at night with his Hunnic concubine. It was suspected that this girl killed him. The very wise Priscus the Thracian wrote about this war." [...] – Chronicon Paschale, p. 587.Jordanes reports the number of dead from this battle as 165,000, excluding the casualties of the Franco-Gepid skirmish previous to the main battle. Hydatius, a historian who lived at the time of Attila's invasion, reports the number of 300,000 dead. The garbled Chronicle of Fredegar states that in a prior battle on the Loire, 200,000 Goths and 150,000 Huns were slain. The figures offered are implausibly high, but the battle was noted as being exceptionally bloody by all of the primary sources. It is ultimately Jordanes' writing that leads to the difference in opinions in modern interpretations of the battle's outcome.|$|E
