5000|$|Assessment of the {{situation}} by the two tribunals differs significantly.

Therefore, it assessed [...] "all these facts lead to confusion of the roles actually played by ČNTS and CET21 and the Media Council could legitimately fear that a situation had arisen where there had been a de facto transfer of the License from CET21 to ČNTS ... The commencement of the administrative proceedings against ČNTS for <b>alleged</b> <b>unauthorized</b> broadcasting constituted the normal exercise of the regulatory duties of the Media Council (and) was not arbitrary." ...|$|R

5000|$|Bloggers, journalists, news {{agencies}} and photographers alike have charged that Hilton posts paparazzi photographs and other copyrighted content from their sites. On November 30, 2006, the photo agency X17Online {{filed a lawsuit}} against L Hilton in federal court, seeking over US$7.5 million in damages for copyright infringement. X17's co-owner Robin Navarre told the Los Angeles Times that the sale value of their photographs has been significantly reduced because the photos have appeared on PerezHilton.com before they could be published in magazines to which exclusivity is important. Navarre said, X17 can make as much as {{tens of thousands of dollars}} from one magazine on an exclusive story. In the case of the Spears smooch shot, X17 sold a two-page spread to Us Weekly, but the magazine decided to shrink the photo play (which lowered the price by $10,000, to $15,000)...because the images had already been on Hilton's site and others. Hilton defends his use of this material by claiming it falls under the fair use exception to the Copyright Act; that is, according to the Los Angeles Times, the photos are altered [...] "to achieve a satiric or humorous end".

5000|$|John W. Dean, {{the former}} counsel to Richard Nixon, writes {{in an open}} letter to Patrick Fitzgerald:In your post as Special Counsel, you now have nothing less than {{authority}} of the Attorney General of the United States, for purposes of the investigation and prosecution of [...] "the <b>alleged</b> <b>unauthorized</b> disclosure of a CIA employee's identity." [...] (The employee, of course, is Valerie Plame Wilson, a CIA employee with classified status, and the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson.) On December 30, 2003, you received a letter from the Deputy Attorney General regarding your powers. On February 6, 2004, you received a letter of further clarification, stating without reservation, that in this matter your powers are [...] "plenary." [...] In effect, then, you act with the power of the Attorney General of the United States.In light of your broad powers, the limits and narrow focus of your investigation are surprising. On October 28 of this year, your office released a press statement in which you stated that [...] "A major focus of the grand jury investigation was to determine which government officials had disclosed to the media prior to July 14, 2003, information concerning Valerie Wilson's CIA affiliation, and the nature, timing, extent, and purpose of such disclosures, as well as whether any official made such a disclosure knowing that Valerie Wilson's employment by the CIA was classified information."Troubling, from an historical point of view, {{is the fact that the}} narrowness of your investigation, which apparently is focusing on the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (making it a crime to uncover the covert status of a CIA agent), plays right into the hands of perpetrators in the Administration.Indeed, this is exactly the plan that was employed during Watergate by those who sought to conceal the Nixon Administration's crimes, and keep criminals in office.The plan was to keep the investigation focused on the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters - and away from the atmosphere in which such an action was undertaken. Toward this end, I was directed by superiors to get the Department of Justice to keep its focus on the break-in, and nothing else.That was done. And had Congress not undertaken its own investigation (since it was a Democratically-controlled Congress with a Republican President) it is very likely that Watergate would have ended with the conviction of those caught in the bungled burglary and wiretapping attempt at the Democratic headquarters.|$|R

The petition alleges that Scott Clark, the station's engineer, had [...] "assumed {{a position on}} the board without having been approved". Statements by Cox regarding this lack of board approval were not presented under oath, and were therefore, rejected by the FCC. The FCC found that with each board member having a 20 percent influence on the votes of the board. With 40 percent vacant by the resignations of Cox and Allen, 60 percent, therefore, a majority voting stake, still belonged to original board members. Consequently, the FCC rejected this allegation, and no fines were issued.|$|R
