An access control framework similar to Oracle VPD cannot prevent the access to a single unauthorized sender field. In contrast, it would prevent the access to the whole document containing such a field. Such a mechanism is too restrictive as all other fields of the considered document could be freely accessed.|$|E

Drawing on experiences from a semester-long field school in East Africa, we provide a student’s {{perspective on the}} importance of fieldwork. We argue that bringing the field into the classroom will enrich students’ theoretical understanding, enhance practical skills within and beyond anthropology, and foster an appreciation for cultural difference. We suggest concrete ways in which field methods can be integrated into classroom settings. Finally, we argue that providing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> methods outside field school settings may work to reduce the economic barriers to the cultivation of an “ethnographic sensibility”...|$|E

30|$|At present, the {{research}} study on practical uses of BNNT is extensively and continually conducted. For instance, in water purification, BNNTs has been examined in oil-filtering [69], self-cleaning membranes [70], and reusable heat-resistive films [71]. In {{the field of}} biological application, due to the nontoxicity property, BNNTs {{can be used as}} a biological probe [72], drug carrier [73], or biological channel in biosensor [74]. High stability towards oxidation of BNNTs has enabled its <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> emission technology [75, 76]. In addition, BNNT has also been reported in hydrogen storage [77 – 80], sensing [81, 82], and optoelectronic [83, 84]. It is highly anticipated that the application of BNNT will continue to extend in the future.|$|E
30|$|We {{conclude}} {{by noting}} that all three approaches studied: model-assisted estimation, model-based inference, and hybrid inference, have advantages and disadvantages when applied in large-area forest surveys. A main advantage of model-assisted estimation is that unbiasedness of estimators does not rely on the suitability of the model, but the model only helps to improve the precision of an estimator known to be (approximately) unbiased. Model-based and hybrid inference rely on the suitability of the model, but may have several advantages under conditions where <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> plots is difficult or expensive. All three approaches rely on the possibility to develop accurate models, which is possible for several important forest variables (such as biomass), but not for all variables that are included in a normal national forest inventory.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in digital technologies are heralding {{significant changes in}} the way we acquire, visualise and analyse archaeological data. Terrestrial laser scanners can be used to create photo-realistic virtual copies of landscapes, and archaeological features, and offer the potential to improve our understanding of three-dimensional (3 D) spatial relationships at study sites. Here we present a methodology for the integration of a high-resolution 3 D site model with soil chemical data obtained from an abandoned settlement site located in the Central Highlands of Scotland. At this site, the multi-element concentration in soil, co-visualised within a topographic setting, has an important role to play in elucidating settlement layout and activity. The methods described here are also of significance in archiving sites of archaeological/historical importance where development activities and/or environmental processes may destroy remains, or where <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> sites is restricted...|$|E
40|$|Predicting {{current and}} {{potential}} species distributions and abundance {{is critical for}} managing invasive species, preserving threatened and endangered species, and conserving native species and habitats. Accurate predictive models are needed at local, regional, and national scales to guide field surveys, improve monitoring, and set priorities for conservation and restoration. Modeling capabilities, however, are often limited by access to software and environmental data required for predictions. To address these needs, we built a comprehensive web-based system that: (1) maintains a large database of field data; (2) provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> data and a wealth of environmental data; (3) accesses values in rasters representing environmental characteristics; (4) runs statistical spatial models; and (5) creates maps that predict the potential species distribution. The system is available online at www. niiss. org, and provides web-based tools for stakeholders to create potential species distribution models and maps under current and future climate scenarios...|$|E

40|$|In many {{fields and}} in {{education}} in particular, researchers, such as teachers, {{are inclined to}} believe that because they are enmeshed in the field or have good relationships with students, issues of politics, power and status will exert minimal influence and that access to the field will be smooth and unproblematic. In this paper, three doctoral students {{with varying degrees of}} insider status, working in the Australian context, reflect on the rocky journeys they experienced obtaining and maintaining <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> sites. The authors argue that despite a body of literature addressing this issue, many of the commonly used texts devoted to educational research do not adequately tackle the subject. The novice researcher often remains unsuspecting and under prepared for the range and depth of difficulties encountered in the process of gaining access. The question is posed, what might be the role of the academy in preparing researchers...|$|E
30|$|Recent studies provide {{empirical}} evidence on persistence of horizontal inequality of {{field of study}} depending on eligible individuals' social origin. In this article we explore the question why there is a correlation between social origin and choice of field of study. Using data from the Saxon survey of high school graduate candidates, we model the decision process {{of high school students}} regarding post-secondary education about three month prior to graduation. Our empirical results prove that the effect of social origin on the choice of field of study is the result of an individual decision structured by status maintenance motive, by expected costs for the different types of higher education and training, by individual ability level, by expected success probabilities {{as well as by the}} socio-cultural distance to tertiary education. These determinants of the choice of field of study explains the effect of social origin and, therefore for the aggregate, the persistent social inequality of opportunities in the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> of study.|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} and effort {{required to achieve}} the widespread implementation of best-practice child interview guidelines justifies the establishment of structures to enhance cross-jurisdictional sharing of expertise, resources and training delivery support. Australia has made great strides toward such a system via work currently being undertaken by police jurisdictions to facilitate greater consistency in education and training for practitioners {{in the area of}} investigative interviewing, strengthening collaboration between police and tertiary education institutions, and growing commitment to evidence-based policy and practice among police executives. To maximise progress, however, organisations need to consider the development of a coordinated continual quality improvement approach. This will be impeded by three structural elements: <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>field</b> interviews for practitioner feedback and organisational evaluation, interviewer tenure and case tracking. This article discusses each element, their roles within a national best-practice interview framework, and attempts by some jurisdictions to address them. It also provides recommendations to guide further reform...|$|E
3000|$|... access: {{represents}} two particular {{types of}} relations: <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>fields</b> or method calls. Thus, access {{is a particular}} case of a depend relation. For example, an object may hold a reference to an object in another domain (depend), {{but it may not}} use its services (access). A typical example is an object received as argument in a Facade method and that is just passed to another method behind the Facade (i.e. the Facade does not call any method or access any field from this object).|$|R
50|$|Subject-oriented {{programming}} advocates {{the organization}} of the classes that describe objects into “subjects”, which may be composed to form larger subjects. At points of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fields</b> or methods, several subjects’ contributions may be composed. These points were characterized as the join-points of the subjects. For example, if a tree is cut-down, the methods involved may need to join behavior in the bird and tax-assessor’s subjects with that of the tree’s own. It is therefore fundamentally a view of the compositional nature of software development, as opposed to the algorithmic (procedural) or representation-hiding (object) nature.|$|R
