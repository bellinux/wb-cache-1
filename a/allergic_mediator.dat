Pre-incubation of cultures for 48 hr without mitogen prior to transformation studies restored normal lymphocyte thymidine uptake in cells from severe atopics, suggesting a labile suppressor cell population, or a labile suppressor substance.

Drugs affecting microtubule dynamics effectively suppressed the FcɛRI-mediated translocation of granules to the plasma membrane and degranulation. Furthermore, the translocation of granules to the plasma membrane occurred in a calcium-independent manner, but the release of mediators and granule–plasma membrane fusion were completely dependent on calcium. Thus, the degranulation process can be dissected into two events: the calcium-independent microtubule-dependent translocation of granules to the plasma membrane and calcium-dependent membrane fusion and exocytosis.

SP enhanced the allergen-activated ERK pathway in RBL- 2 H 3 cells, and Rb 1 effectively inhibited the ERK pathway activation. Although MAPK specific inhibitors suppressed LTC 4 and IL- 4, only U 0126 inhibited the SP enhanced histamine release. These results demonstrate that Rb 1 dose-dependently inhibited SP enhanced allergen-induced mediator release and its mechanism was through the inhibition of the ERK pathway...|$|R
40|$|Activation of Ras GTPases is a conserved {{feature of}} antigen {{receptor}} signaling, including Fc�R 1 activation of mast cells. Antigenic cross-linking of the Fc�R 1 on mast cells results in secretion of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> and induction of immediate early and cytokine genes. Here {{we examine the}} role of Ras in coupling the Fc�R 1 to transcriptional regulation. The transcription factors Elk- 1, an immediate early gene regulator and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), {{in the context of}} the IL- 4 gene, are identified as Ras targets in mast cells. Ras mediates diverse effects via its diverse effector pathways, which may include other members of the Ras GTPase family such as RhoA and Rac- 1. We observe that Elk- 1 and NFAT are targeted by distinct Ras effector pathways in mast cells. Activation of the “classical ” Ras/Raf- 1 /MEK/ ERK cascade is necessary and sufficient for Fc�R 1 induction of Elk- 1. Ras function is required, but not sufficient for Fc�R 1 induction of NFAT. However, activation or inhibition of Ras markedly shifts the antigen dose-response for Fc�R 1 induction of NFAT. The effector pathway for Ras activation of NFAT is not Raf- 1 /MEK. We identify that the Rac- 1 GTPase is critical in Fc�R 1 regulation of NFAT, acting either in parallel with or as an effector of Ras. These data place Ras in a crucial position in mast cells, regulating disparate nuclear targets...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The spleen {{tyrosine}} kinase (Syk) {{is recognized as}} a potential pharmaceutical target {{for the treatment of}} type I hypersensitivity reactions including allergic rhinitis, urticaria, asthma, and anaphylaxis because of its critical position upstream of immunoreceptor signaling complexes that regulate inflammatory responses in leukocytes. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to improve the selectivity of anti-Syk therapies by impeding the interaction of Syk with its cellular partners, instead of targeting its catalytic site. METHODS: We have previously studied the inhibitory effects of the anti-Syk intracellular antibody G 4 G 11 on Fc epsilonRI-induced release of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators.</b> A compound collection was screened by using an antibody displacement assay to identify functional mimics of G 4 G 11 that act as potential inhibitors of the allergic response. The effects of the selected druglike compounds on mast cell activation were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We discovered compound 13, a small molecule that inhibits Fc epsilonRI-induced mast cell degranulation in vitro and anaphylactic shock in vivo. Importantly, compound 13 was efficient when administered orally to mice. Structural analysis, docking, and site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to identify the binding cavity of this compound, located at the interface between the 2 Src homology 2 domains and the interdomain A of Syk. CONCLUSION: We have isolated a new class of druglike compounds that modulate the interaction of Syk with some of its macromolecular substrates implicated in the degranulation pathway in mast cells...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prevalence and {{morbidity}} of allergic diseases {{have increased}} over the last decades. Based on the recently recognized differences in asthma prevalence between the sexes, we have examined the effect of endogenous estrogens on {{a key element of}} the allergic response. Some lipophilic pollutants have estrogen-like activities and are termed environmental estrogens. These pollutants tend to degrade slowly in the environment and to bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in the food chain; they also have long biological half-lives. OBJECTIVES: Our goal in this study was to identify possible pathogenic roles for environmental estrogens in the development of allergic diseases. METHODS: We screened a number of environmental estrogens for their ability to modulate the release of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> from mast cells. We incubated a human mast cell line and primary mast cell cultures derived from bone marrow of wild type and estrogen receptor α (ER-α) –deficient mice with environmental estrogens with and without estradiol or IgE and allergens. We assessed degranulation of mast cells by quantifying the release of β-hexosaminidase. RESULTS: All of the environmental estrogens tested caused rapid, dose-related release of β-hexosaminidase from mast cells and enhanced IgE-mediated release. The combination of physiologic concentrations of 17 β-estradiol and several concentrations of environmental estrogens had additive effects on mast cell degranulation. Comparison of bone marrow mast cells from ER-α– sufficient and ER-α–deficient mice indicated that much of the effect of environmental estrogens was mediated by ER-α. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that estrogenic environmental pollutants might promote allergic diseases by inducing and enhancing mast cell degranulation by physiologic estrogens and exposure to allergens...|$|R
40|$|Background: We have {{produced}} hypertrophic and metaplastic changes of goblet cells in nasal epithelium of ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized rats by intranasal challenge with OVA. A variety of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> and inflammatory cells {{are capable of}} stimulating goblet cell degranulation (epithelial mucus secretion); however, {{little is known about}} the mechanism by which antigen induces mucus hypersecretion. Objective: Our aim was to explain the mechanism of goblet cell degranulation in allergic inflammation. Methods: Antigen-induced goblet cell degranulation was evaluated by the transient decrease of epithelial mucosubstance 1 to 6 hours after intranasal challenge with OVA in nasal epithelium of OVA-sensitized rats. The effects of the H 1 -antagonist (d -chlorpheniramine malate), H 2 -antagonist (cimetidine), atropine, indomethacin, cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) antagonist (ONO 1078), and antirat PMN antiserum on OVA-induced goblet cell degranulation were examined. Results: Goblet cell secretion 1 hour after OVA challenge was significantly inhibited by H 1 -antagonist, atropine, and cysLT antagonist, whereas the secretion 6 hours after the challenge was significantly inhibited by cysLT antagonist and antirat PMN antiserum. Circulating PMN cells and mucosal infiltrating eosinophils were completely abolished by antirat PMN antiserum. Conclusions: These results indicate the different mechanisms of goblet cell secretion between early-phase (1 hour after OVA challenge) and late-phase (6 hours after the challenge) reactions. Histamine stimulates early-phase secretion through the H 1 -receptor of cholinergic nerve terminals, and infiltrating inflammatory cells (eosinophils and/or neutrophils) play a role in late-phase secretion. CysLTs (leukotrienes C 4, D 4, and E 4) are important for both early-phase and late-phase secretion...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rat trachea {{display a}} {{differential}} topographical distribution of connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) and mucosal mast cells (MMC) that may imply regional {{differences in the}} release of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and eicosanoids. Aim: To evaluate the role of CTMC and MMC for release of TNF-a and eicosanoids after allergenic challenge in distinct segments of rat trachea. Materials and methods: Proximal trachea (PT) and distal trachea (DT) from ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized rats, treated or not with compound 48 / 80 (48 / 80) or dexamethasone, were incubated in culture medium. After OVA challenge, aliquots were collected to study release of TNF-a and eicosanoids. Results: Release of TNF-a by PT upon OVA challenge peaked at 90 min and decayed at 6 and 24 h. Release from DT peaked at 30 / 90 min and decayed 6 and 24 h later. When CTMC were depleted with 48 / 80, OVA challenge exacerbated the TNF-a release by PT at all time intervals, while DT exacerbated TNF-a levels 6 and 24 h later only. Dexamethasone reduced TNF-a production after 90 min of OVA challenge in PT and at 3 and 6 h in DT. OVA challenge increased prostaglandin D 2 in DT and leukotriene B 4 in both segments but did not modify prostaglandin E 2 and leukotriene C 4 release. Conclusion: OVA challenge induces TNF-a release from MMC, which is negatively regulated by CTMC. The profile of TNF-a and eicosanoids depends on the time after OVA challenge and of the tracheal segment considered...|$|R
40|$|Triggering of {{mast cells}} and basophils by IgE and Ag initiates {{a cascade of}} {{biochemical}} events that lead to cell degranulation {{and the release of}} <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators.</b> Receptor aggregation also induces a series of biochemical events capable of limiting Fc epsilon RI-triggered signals and functional responses. Relevant to this, we have recently demonstrated that Cbl-interacting 85 -kDa protein (CIN 85), a multiadaptor protein mainly involved in the process of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, regulates the Ag-dependent endocytosis of the IgE receptor, with consequent impairment of FciERI-mediated cell degranulation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to further investigate whether CIN 85 could alter the Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling by affecting the activity and/or expression of molecules directly implicated in signal propagation. We found that CIN 85 overexpression inhibits the Fc epsilon RI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma, thus altering calcium mobilization. This functional defect is associated with a substantial decrease of Syk protein levels, which are restored by the use of selective proteasome inhibitors, and it is mainly due to the action of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that CIN 85 overexpression limits the ability of Cbl to bind suppressor of TCR signaling 1 (Stsl), a negative regulator of Cbl functions, while CIN 85 knockdown favors the formation of Cbl/Sts 1 complexes. Altogether, our findings support a new role for CIN 85 in regulating Syk protein levels in RBL- 2 H 3 cells through the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and provide a mechanism for this regulation involving c-Cbl ligase activity...|$|R
40|$|Viral {{respiratory}} {{infections are}} increasingly implicated in allergic exacerbations. The mechanisms behind this are not known, but a virus-induced activation of eosinophils through TLRs could be involved. Herein, we investigated the expression {{and function of}} TLR 7 and TLR 9 in purified eosinophils from peripheral blood and assessed their role in allergic airway inflammation. Eosinophils expressed TLR 7 and TLR 9 proteins. Stimulation with the cognate ligands R- 837 and CpG was found to prolong survival, up-regulate expression of CD 11 b, and conversely, down-regulate L-selectin expression, increase expression of the activation marker CD 69, facilitate the chemotactic migration, and enhance IL- 8 secretion by eosinophils. Also, CpG induced release of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and R- 837 failed to do so. Analogously, eosinophils activated by CpG, but not R- 837, promoted airway epithelial cell death and cytokine release. Priming with the <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> histamine, IL- 4, and most prominently, IL- 5 augmented the TLR-induced IL- 8 and EDN secretion, revealing an ability to sensitize eosinophils for TLR 7 and TLR 9 activation. Moreover, the TLR responses of eosinophils were higher in allergic as compared with healthy subjects, manifested {{by an increase in}} IL- 8 and EDN release. Correspondingly, allergic subjects displayed an elevated serum level of IL- 5, suggesting increased IL- 5 -mediated priming. This study shows that activation via TLR 7 and TLR 9 affects several eosinophil functions and that the atopic status of the donor and the presence of a Th 2 -like cytokine milieu affect the outcome of the response. Thus, eosinophil activation via TLR 7 and TLR 9 might engender a link between viral infection and allergic exacerbations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dendritic {{cells are}} antigen-presenting cells {{central to the}} immune system. They {{activate}} and orchestrate the innate and the adaptive immune systems. This phenotypically diverse group can be further divided into 2 subsets, the CD 11 c(+) myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and the CD 123 (+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of allergen exposure on dendritic cells in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Methods: Atopic and non-atopic subjects were challenged intranasally with birch or timothy allergen. Nasal biopsies were taken before and 24 h after challenge, and were, after CD 68 exclusion, stained for expression of CD 11 c and CD 123 to identify dendritic cell subsets. The effect of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> on CD 68 (-), CD 123 (+) cells was studied with flow cytometry analysis in peripheral blood. Results: The amount of CD 68 (-), CD 123 (+) cells increased in the nasal sub-epithelium upon allergen challenge, whereas the number of CD 68 (-), CD 11 c(+) cells was unaffected. In vitro study of the effect of inflammatory mediators on pDC phenotype showed an increased activation in response TNF-alpha, IL- 4 and CpG. Furthermore, TNF-alpha caused a higher activation among atopic than non-atopic subjects. Conclusions: An increased number of CD 68 (-), CD 123 (+) dendritic cells along with the positive pDC response following stimulation with inflammatory mediators suggest that the increased pDCs may be of an activated phenotype. It also suggests that the inflammatory response by pDCs to mediators such as TNF-alpha may be markedly higher in atopic subjects. These data support the notion of pDCs as important participants in allergic rhinitis. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{hyperplastic}} eosinophilic sinusitis (CHES) is {{an inflammatory}} disease characterized by eosinophil infiltration of sinus tissue that can present {{with and without}} nasal polyps (NPs). Aeroallergen sensitization in CHES occurs regularly, but the causality between allergen sensitivity, exposure, and disease is unclear. Methods: Allergen is unlikely to directly enter healthy sinuses either by diffusion or ciliary flow, and, even this is more problematic given the loss of patency of the ostia of diseased sinuses. Inflammation and tissue eosinophilia can develop secondary to allergen exposure in the nares, with systemic humoral recirculation of allergic cells including eosinophils, Th 2 lymphocytes, and eosinophil precursors that are nonspecifically recruited back to the diseased sinuses. Results: The possibility of an allergic reaction to peptides derived from bacteria (i. e., Staphylococcus or superantigens) or fungi that colonize the diseased sinus also provides a plausible allergic mechanism. Conclusion: Treatments of this disease include agents directed at <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> such as leukotriene modifiers and corticosteroids, although this does not necessarily signify that an IgE-dependent mechanism can be ascribed. However, more recently, omalizumab has shown promise, including in patients without obvious aeroallergen sensitization. Although {{many aspects of the}} role of allergy in CHES remain a mystery, the mechanisms that are being elucidated allow for improved understanding of this disease, which ultimately will lead to better treatments for our patients who live daily with this disease.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the spleen {{tyrosine}} kinase (Syk) {{has shown a}} high potential for the discovery of new treatments for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Pharmacological inhibitors of Syk catalytic site bearing therapeutic potential have been developed, with however limited specificity towards Syk. To address this topic, we opted {{for the design of}} drug-like compounds that could impede the interaction of Syk with its cellular partners while maintaining an active kinase protein. To achieve this challenging task, we used the powerful potential of intracellular antibodies for the modulation of cellular functions in vivo, combined to structure-based in silico screening. In our previous studies, we reported the anti-allergic properties of the intracellular antibody G 4 G 11. With the aim of finding functional mimics of G 4 G 11, we developed an Antibody Displacement Assay and we isolated the drug-like compound C- 13, with promising in vivo anti-allergic activity. The likely binding cavity of this compound is located at the close vicinity of G 4 G 11 epitope, far away from the catalytic site of Syk. Here we report the virtual screen of a collection of 500, 000 molecules against this new cavity, which led to the isolation of 1000 compounds subsequently evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory effects using the Antibody Displacement Assay. Eighty five compounds were selected and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the liberation of <b>allergic</b> <b>mediators</b> from mast cells. Among them, 10 compounds inhibited degranulation with IC 50 values # 10 mM. The most bioactive compounds combine biological activity, significant inhibition of antibody binding and strong affinity for Syk. Moreover, these molecule...|$|R
