40|$|In {{this paper}} we use Colombian {{manufacturing}} data on exports and external financing {{for the period}} 1998 − 2006 to estimate the credit elasticity of exports. We use bank-firm linked data to construct a supply side instrument for <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer’s</b> demand of credit, which we use to address the reverse causality between <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer’s</b> export revenue and its demand for credit. We find that access to credit produces a significant increase on <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer’s</b> export revenue explained by {{the positive effect of}} credit on an exporter’s market reach - number of destinations -. Across manufacturers the effect of credit on <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer’s</b> export revenue varies by size. While medium sized manufacturers use credit to increase their market reach, market penetration and product mix, large manufacturers only use credit to increase their market reach. Small manufacturers do not seem to benefit from bank credit. ...|$|R

The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) {{and turns it}} into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E

5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E

5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E

5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E

He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E
