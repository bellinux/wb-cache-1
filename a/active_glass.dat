40|$|Plans for the {{treatment}} of high level waste (HL W) at the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) are based upon the inventory of the tank wastes, the anticipated performance of the pretreatment processes, and current understanding of the capability of the borosilicate glass waste form [I]. The WTP HLW melter design, unlike earlier DOE melter designs, incorporates an <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> bubbler system. The bubblers create <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> pool convection and thereby improve heat and mass transfer and increase glass melting rates. The WTP HLW melter has a glass surface area of 3. 75 m{sup 2 } and depth of ~ 1. 1 m. The two melters in the HLW facility together are designed to produce up to 7. 5 MT of glass per day at 100 % availability. Further increases in HL W waste processing rates can potentially be achieved by increasing the melter operating temperature above 1150 �C and by increasing the waste loading in the glass product. Increasing the waste loading also has the added benefit of decreasing the number of canisters for storage...|$|E

40|$|Glass eels (Anguilla anguilla) {{arriving}} {{after the}} fishing {{season in the}} Vilaine estuary (France) were caught by boat and at a trapping ladder located at a blocking dam upstream in the estuary. They were marked with Bismarck brown, rhodamine B or neutral red, and released into the estuary. The effect of marking on behaviour, mortality and recapture differed according to the dye and concentration used. The glass eels also differed in response to marking according to their origin. Estuarine glass eels were clearly desynchronized in their selective tidal stream transport and left the release area after a few tidal cycles. Trapped glass eels were less sensitive to marking. They remained in the release area and were recaptured in larger number both in the trapping ladder and in the estuary. These results supported a model of two behavioral fractions in the estuary: flow-carried migrants and <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> eels with stronger rheotactic behaviour. The proportion of <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> eels in the estuary shifted from none for the {{two weeks after the}} fishery closure, to 10 % value of the total stock. At the trapping ladder, the migration ended in June each year, while a large stock was still present in the estuary. These observations favour the interpretation of a short duration of the active phase at this site followed by the transition towards a more benthic behavior. The daily efficiency of the trapping ladder was calculated as 4 % of the active stock from both stock estimations and average recapture rate. This value was consistent with the low annual efficiency of the trapping ladder, calculated as 30 % of the estuarine stock of glass eels that arrived after the fishing season...|$|E
40|$|Magneto-optical {{glasses are}} of {{considerable}} current interest, primarily for applications in fiber circuitry, optical isolation, all-optical diodes, optical switching and modulation. While the benchmark materials are still crystalline, glasses {{offer a variety}} of unique advantages, such as very high rare-earth and heavy-metal solubility and, in principle, the possibility of being produced in fiber form. In comparison to conventional fiber-drawing processes, pressure-assisted melt-filling of microcapillaries or photonic crystal fibers with magneto-optical glasses offers an alternative route to creating complex waveguide architectures from unusual combinations of glasses. For instance, strongly diamagnetic tellurite or chalcogenide glasses with high refractive index can be combined with silica in an all-solid, microstructured waveguide.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a summary {{analysis of the}} typological and historical development of <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> walls. From {{the beginning of the}} glass revolution, the fascination with large areas of transparency has been tempered by the negative environmental effects they can produce: excessive heat loss when it is cold, excessive heat gain when the sun shines, and even excessive daylighting. These problems were already recognized by the glazing pioneers of the nineteenth century, and it was apparently Jean-Baptiste Jobard in 1849 who first imagined that the air between the layers of glass could itself be heated or cooled and so modify the effects of large glass walls. In 1914, Paul Scheerbart, the visionary author of Glasarchitektur, cautioned against that practice, arguing that “convectors and radiant heaters should not be put between the two skins [of glass] because too much of their output will lost to the outside air, ” and so began nearly a hundred years of experimentation and dispute about heating, cooling, or moving the air in glass walls. 1 The technique was picked up a few years after Scheerbart by Le Corbusier, who called it a “neutral wall”, and then by many others in the decades after the second world war as glass curtain walls became a normative form of construction. In recent decades, the numbers and variety of <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> walls have exploded, initially in northern Europe, but increasingly in Asia and the Americas as well. Some of the more common terms of designation are “double glass facades, ” “climate walls, ” “air-extract windows, ” intelligent facades, ” and “multiple skin facades, ” and while there are some distinct classes of these walls, the proliferation of types and of categorizations can make the field difficult t...|$|E

In comparison with non-alloyed glass 1393 nBG, it was found out that apatite formation is slowed down in Sr introduction that, probably, is the result of inhibiting action of Sr ions on HA crystallization. In addition, it was revealed that crystallinity of precipitated calcium phosphate was lower in the case with Sr-alloyed glass 1393 nBG compared to a pure standard material 1393 nBG. The authors of the abovementioned work also point out that the ability to form HA bioactive glasses gives the notion about their surface reactivity that has relation to the application of the nano-scaled particles of biologically <b>active</b> <b>glass</b> in bone regeneration.|$|E

The leachants activity measurements, as well as glass specimen's activity before and after leaching, were conducted using gamma spectroscopy. The release of plutonium from phosphate glass at 90 C is two orders of magnitude higher in comparison with borosilicate glass. The temperature influence is also greater for phosphate glass.

A well-known (single channel- simplex) device for the pregnancy test is a typical example of the lateral flow assay.

40|$|Multilayered thin oxide {{films have}} been {{deposited}} on solar collector glazing by sol-gel dip coating in a dust-free environment {{provided by a}} laminar flux chapel. A superior film quality and a satisfying film homogeneity have been achieved for the produced coatings which are nearly completely free of visible point defects. The thicknesses of the individual layers are determined by a numerical analysis of angle-dependent spectral transmittance data. The visible reflectance RVIS, and the CIE color coordinates for the multilayer stacks have been inferred from spectral reflectance data as functions of the angle of reflection. The angle-dependent solar transmission Tsol has been measured directly by a solar simulator in combination with a thermopile detector. The energy efficiency of the visible reflection M = RVIS/(100 % Tsol) can thus be determined {{as a function of}} the incident angle. The produced coatings combine a bright colored reflection with an acceptable solar transmittance, and are thus well suited for the application in colored glazed thermal solar collectors.
