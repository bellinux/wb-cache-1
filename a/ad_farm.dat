Though arrests have been made, all suspects have been released for want of evidence.A terrorist movement based in Bat Ayin, later known as the Bat Ayin Underground, was founded on the belief, shared by extremist settlers, that the Israeli government was acting against {{the interests of the}} Jewish people. The group's agenda has been seen as [...] "isolationist" [...] in its hostility to secular Israeli society and commitment to the Torah. The notion of forming such a group apparently arose in late 1998, {{as a result of a}} conversation between two eighteen-year-olds - Shahar Dvir-Zeliger, who hailed from the Adei <b>Ad</b> <b>farm,</b> and Sela Tor, who alternated between Hebron and the Maon Farm founded by his brother Yehoshafat. The Maon Farm provided several recruits, as did the Jewish settlement in Hebron. They eventually recruited Shahar's brother Shlomo, Yarden Morag, and Ofer Gamliel, whose engineering background in the IDF was to prove useful in making a bomb. In early 2001, they began to engage in drive-by shootings of Palestine cars at nighttime on minor roadways, spraying them with fire from automatic weapons, and the planting of bombs in public buildings. Their most notable success was an ambush of a Palestinian Mercedes truck near Ramallah and Kokhav HaShahar, killing its two occupants, one a twenty-year-old man. Cell members claimed responsibility through a group called [...] "Tears of the Widows and the Orphans". Overall, the group, once arrested, admitted to seven attacks of this nature, which claimed eight Palestinian lives and sixteen wounded.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of excavations undertaken between 1977 and 1981 at the remarkable ruins known as Le Mura di Santo Stefano, situated near Anguillara Sabazia, just under 3 km south of Lake Bracciano. The earliest phase of occupation concerned a first-century <b>ad</b> <b>farm.</b> Around ad 200 a range of buildings was constructed, including a three-storey rectangular building lavishly decorated with nineteen types of marble, suggesting that the complex was a luxury retreat, possibly part of a latifundium. There is evidence for further activity in the third or early fourth century. In the ninth century, after a period of abandonment, part of the complex was converted into the church of Santo Stefano. The rectangular building was reoccupied and the remaining ruins used as a cemetery. It is argued that the site may have functioned as the centre of a medieval estate, part of a papal domusculta, or alternatively as a fundus of a monastic establishment. In the eleventh century the site was deserted after the skeletal remains of a least 90 individuals, along with the bones of three dogs, were interred in a pit and capped with several pieces of Roman marble sculpture...|$|E

50|$|For most {{of central}} sub-Saharan Africa, {{agricultural}} expansion marked the period before 500 <b>AD.</b> <b>Farming</b> began earliest {{on the southern}} tips of the Sahara, eventually giving rise to village settlements. Toward {{the end of the}} classical era, larger regional kingdoms had formed in West Africa, one of which was the Kingdom of Ghana, north of what is today the nation of Ghana. Before its fall {{at the beginning of the}} 10th century Ashanti migrants moved southward and founded several nation-states, including the first empire of Bono founded in the 11th century and for which the Brong-Ahafo (Bono Ahafo) region is named. Later Akan ethnic groups such as the Ashanti empire-kingdom and Fante states are thought to possibly have roots in the original Bono settlement at Bono manso. Much of the area was united under the Empire of Ashanti by the 16th century. The Ashanti government operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralized empire-kingdom with an advanced, highly specialized bureaucracy centred on the Ashanti people ethnic group capital Kumasi.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in transoceanic connections between prehistoric communities occupying the Indian Ocean rim. Corroborative and well-sequenced archaeological data from eastern Africa have, however, been notably lacking. Recent excavations by the Sealinks Project in the coastal region of Kenya has sought to redress this imbalance by collecting base-line data on the local communities occupying this region between c. 1000 BC and AD 1000. Although our analyses are still preliminary, the quality of faunal and botanical material recovered demonstrates considerable potential for exploring local interactions and transitions between early hunter-forager and food-producing communities. A key finding in this regard was the identification of a suite of African crops (Sorghum, Pennisetum and Eleusine) at first millennium <b>AD</b> <b>farming</b> and hunter-forager sites, providing the first significant evidence for early agriculture on the Kenyan coast {{and the role of}} crops in forager-farmer trade. Other material data, notably the transfer of marine shell and glass beads inland, and the use of ceramics, indicate a tentative correspondence between the increased intensity of such local interactions {{in the latter half of}} the first millennium AD and the emergence of wider Indian Ocean connections...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a quantitative data collection. The study {{is part of the}} Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme. This project, carried out jointly by the University of Reading and Southampton, successfully combined agricultural economics, rural sociology, civil engineering, energy accounting and environmental biology to critically evaluate issues associated with the adoption of anaerobic digestion (<b>AD)</b> on <b>farms</b> in the UK. Policy issues were addressed through analysis of regulatory measures within the EU and those specific to the UK. Models were developed to analyse the economics, energetics and land use implications of diversification into on-farm energy production. An assessment was made of the benefits and potential drawbacks regarding environmental protection and sustainable agricultural practice, through environmental risk-based analysis methodologies. Farmer opinions were sought on diversification and renewable energy production, and the potential benefits to the rural community from uptake of anaerobic digestion in integrated farming systems were explored. A random sample of 2, 000 farmers in England was surveyed by means of a postal questionnaire, resulting in 382 usable responses. The purpose of the survey was to determine farmer attitudes to AD, level of interest in uptake of AD, barriers to uptake and types of AD operation and feedstock that might be used. A stratified (by rural/urban residence and household income) random sample of 1, 500 consumers was surveyed (212 responses). The purpose of the survey was to examine the views of consumers, in rural and urban locations, to a range of issues associated with use of <b>AD</b> on <b>farms,</b> such as odours, visual intrusion, traffic effects, use of digestate (especially on food crops) and their willingness to pay higher taxes to provide subsidy to encourage farmers to take up the technology.

The study used the mass balance approach and examined all aspects of the plant.
