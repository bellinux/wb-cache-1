Following testing for the event, however, he suffered severe neck and back pain, and chose instead to announce his retirement; Tommy Ellis replaced Pearson for the race.|$|E

5|$|The mint reopened as an assay {{office in}} 1876. Its {{machinery}} was evidently damaged during the war, {{but because of}} its importance, unlike the mints <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte</b> and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, {{to report on the}} condition of the facility for minting. Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new minting equipment was shipped to New Orleans. The building was refurbished and put back into active minting service in 1879, producing mainly silver coinage, including the famed Morgan silver dollar from 1879 to 1904.|$|E

5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte.</b> Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E

5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers {{who wished to}} step up to the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which took place at the Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte</b> and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E

5|$|Robinson started {{competing}} in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) in 1991, driving the No. 77 Huffman Racing Buick. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was considered NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers who wished {{to step up to}} the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Early on, she struggled to find sponsorship and ran the season without a sponsor. Robinson qualified 26th fastest and finished 15th at her first Busch Series race, which took place at Orange County Speedway. Later that year, she finished 21st at Motor Mile Speedway, and 18th at the season's second race held at Orange County Speedway.

Robinson failed to qualify for the race at Martinsville Speedway. She finished 54th in the Busch Series points standings.|$|E
5|$|When the {{original}} state highway system was designated , M-78 ran along a route similar that of today. It started north of Battle Creek at a junction with then M-79 and {{cut through the}} corner of Barry County to Bellevue, but it turned northeasterly to end <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte</b> at a junction with M-29. By 1927, M-78 was extended southward, replacing M-79 to the Indiana state line, connecting with State Road9 (SR9) south of Sturgis. At the same time, a northerly addition extended the highway concurrently along US Highway 27 (US27) to Dewitt and then solo to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg. The section north of Lansing was changed in 1929. The section from Dewitt Pittsburg was redesignated M-104, and M-78 was extended through East Lansing to Haslett. By 1936, the highway was extended {{all the way into}} Flint to end at M-21. Around the same time, a second routing through downtown Lansing for US27/M-78 was designated along Capitol Avenue; the former route along Main, Kalamazoo and Larch streets and Grand Avenue was given the Truck M-78 designation.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system {{was signed in}} 1919, M-78 {{followed}} a similar routing. At Bellevue, it turned northeast to terminate <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte.</b> In the 1920s, the highway was extended southerly to the Indiana state line near Sturgis and northeasterly into the Lansing area. In the 1930s, M-78 was extended further on its northern and eastern end to Flint. The highway was converted into a freeway in sections starting in the 1960s. During that decade, the southern extension from the 1920s was removed from M-78 and added to other state highways, and in the 1970s, the northeastern extensions, now mostly freeways, were removed from M-78 as well. Two special routes were created {{as a result of}} the various reroutings in the Lansing area, both of which are no longer part of the state highway system.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte,</b> 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E
5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte</b> incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
25|$|Speed {{also started}} six {{races in the}} NASCAR Busch Series between 1983 and 1984. He only made one start in 1983, <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte</b> in the Miller Time 300, where he {{finished}} sixth. In 1984, Speed lost by two feet to Darrell Waltrip in the season opening Goody's 300 at Daytona, and scored another top five in the Mello Yello 300 <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte.</b> Speed's worst qualifying effort was a 13th place start in the season opener. Speed's starts were fifth at Darlington, seventh <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte,</b> third at Darlington and ninth <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1947 {{skiing in}} NSW, with the {{exception}} of Kiandra, was {{under the control of the}} NSW Government which would not allow clubs to build their own accommodation. At the time the Government owned two hotels, the Hotel Kosciusko at Diggers Creek and the Chalet <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte’s</b> Pass and, between the two, a much smaller lodge, Betts Camp. The Government realised that it could not keep up with the booming post-war interest in skiing and decided to allow ski clubs to build their own accommodation. The first clubs to build were Kosciusko Snow Revellers Club in Perisher Valley (1950), Ski Tourers Association at Lake Albina (1951), KAC <b>at</b> <b>Charlotte’s</b> Pass (1952) and Telemark Ski Club in Perisher Valley (1952).|$|R
