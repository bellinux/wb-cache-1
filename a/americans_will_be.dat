500|$|At her {{deportation}} {{hearing on}} October 27, Goldman {{refused to answer}} questions about her beliefs on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: [...] "Today so-called aliens are deported. Tomorrow native <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled." [...] Louis Post at the Department of Labor, which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband's American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well. After initially promising a court fight, she decided not to appeal his ruling.|$|E

Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital on 29 October.|$|E

2500|$|Caitlin Doughty {{additionally}} {{is the founder}} of the “Order of the Good Death” an inclusive community of funeral industry professionals, academics, as well as artists who advocate for and make possible, a more death informed society (Palet). “The Order of the Good Death” is presented to the public as a website that shares articles and information by prominent figures in the death industry that make individuals more informed about the inevitable conclusion of one’s life (Washburn). In previous years the public had an engagement with the cemetery as a community place, which people do not have anymore (Washburn). The Order of the Good Death is Caitlin Doughty’s way of creating a community while teaching individuals to accept death (Washburn). Doughty’s work has a strong focus on ways of “making death a part of one’s life” (Washburn). “If Doughty and the Order’s death-care revolution is successful, <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more comfortable contemplating mortality and dying— thus preparing for it, seriously considering alternatives such as green burial, composting, and using crematoriums that have carbon-offset policies”( [...] Kiley).|$|E

The governor has not only refused to hand them over, but has made them march to Havana, adding that only one chief had the power to redeem them, that the insurgents of this rejection consequently block the port, that they have already sunk a small schooner, that he wanted out of it, threatening to attack the square, the governor has doubled the guards, making patrols all night to prevent a landing, that the city is shaken." ...|$|E

60|$|DEAR SIR:-When I was at Chicago {{two weeks}} ago I saw Mr. Arnold, and from a remark of his I {{inferred}} {{he was thinking of}} the speakership, though I think he was not anxious about it. He seemed most anxious for harmony generally, and particularly that the contested seats from Peoria and McDonough might be rightly determined. Since I came home I had a talk with Cullom, one of our American representatives here, and he says he is for you for Speaker and also that he thinks all the <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> for you, unless it be Gorin, of Macon, of whom he cannot speak. If you would like to be Speaker go right up and see Arnold. He is talented, a practised debater, and, I think, would do himself more credit on the floor than in the Speaker's seat. Go and see him; and if you think fit, show him this letter.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{tendency}} {{of our age}} has been away from hand-made goods, away from the sort of life which produced the great art of the past. That is too big a subject to treat of here. But certainly a sort of feverish impatience has possessed us all, America not least. It may be said {{that this will be}} increased by the war. I think the opposite. Hard spiritual experience and contact with the old world will deepen the American character and cool its fevers, and <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more thorough, less impatient, will give themselves to art and to the sort of life which fosters art, more than they have ever yet given themselves. Great artists, like Whistler and Henry James, will no longer seek their quiet environments in Europe. I believe that this war will be for America the beginning of a great art age; I hope so with all my heart. For art will need a kind home and a new lease of life.|$|E
60|$|I cannot myself {{think that}} all the {{millions}} that are being spent would weigh upon the country with much oppression, if the weight were once properly placed upon the muscles {{that will have to}} bear it. The difficulty will be in the placing of the weight. It has, I know, been argued that the circumstances under which our national debt has extended itself to its present magnificent dimensions cannot be quoted as parallel to those of the present American debt, because we, while we were creating the debt, were taxing ourselves very heavily, whereas the Americans have gone ahead with the creation of their debt before they have levied a shilling on themselves toward the payment of those expenses for which the debt has been encountered. But this argument, even if it were true in its gist, goes no way toward proving that the <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> unable to pay. The population of the present free-soil States is above eighteen millions; that of the States which will probably belong to the Union if secession be accomplished is about twenty-two millions. At a time when our debt had amounted to six hundred millions sterling we had no population such as that to bear the burden. It may be said that we had more amassed wealth than they have. But I take it that the amassed wealth of any country can go but a very little way in defraying the wants or in paying the debts of a people. We again come back to the old maxim, that the labor of a country is its wealth; and that a country will be rich or poor in accordance with the intellectual industry of its people.|$|E
