25|$|In ancient Greek mythology, King Sisyphus {{was sentenced}} to roll an enchanted boulder up a hill, only to stand just before the peak <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> roll itself back down, and to repeat this action forever. This {{consigned}} Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration, and thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as Sisyphean.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to the desolation of the abandoned burnt-out buildings of the South Bronx, Fekner stenciled Last Hope in large letters above one crumbling structure so that every time you passed it you couldn’t block {{it out of your}} vision. Now you know you can’t change the world, but you can’t sit back <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your own little victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe things will start to change.|$|E
25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if your left heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E

500|$|In a {{roundtable}} {{interview with}} multiple news outlets, Vaughn {{responded to a}} question about choosing [...] "Love Love" [...] by the British band Take That for the end-credits theme, explaining, [...] "I bumped into [...] Gary [...] in , and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it?’ And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, ‘I think it’ll be a hit’, and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it.</b> So it’s pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film." [...] An instrumental of the song [...] "Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)" [...] by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.|$|E
500|$|Mary Warnock {{described}} Williams's {{report on}} pornography in 1979, {{as chair of}} the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship, as [...] "agreeable, actually compulsive to read." [...] It relied on a [...] "harm condition" [...] that [...] "no conduct should be suppressed by law unless it can be shown to harm someone," [...] and concluded that so long as children were protected from pornography, adults should be free to read <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> as they see fit. The report rejected the view that pornography tends to cause sexual offences. Two cases in particular were highlighted, the Moors Murders and the Cambridge Rapist, where the influence of pornography had been discussed during the trials. The report argued that both cases appeared to be [...] "more consistent with pre-existing traits being reflected both in a choice of reading matter and in the acts committed against others." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E

2500|$|A stream {{runs through}} the middle of the campus. Starting across 12th Street and flowing through the length of the campus, it passes by the Martha Springer Botanical Garden, the Hatfield Library, Hudson Hall, the University Center, Smith Auditorium and Goudy Commons. This {{artificial}} stream is named the Mill Race, although it is commonly referred to as [...] "the Mill Stream." [...] It forms a [...] "W" [...] shape when viewed from the University Center. As a tradition, undergraduate students are thrown into the Mill Stream on their birthday. Biology and environmental science classes utilize the Mill Stream as an authentic research venue. As part of the freshman matriculation ceremony, new students place a lit candle into the Mill Stream <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> float downstream.|$|E
2500|$|On video are the Covent Garden {{production}} of Salome (1992) in Peter Hall's production, The Cunning Little Vixen (1992), and La traviata (1995). She also {{appears in a}} wide range of specialist recordings for the Reader's Digest, notably the Timeless Favourites series of 3-CD sets produced by Jay Productions between 1995 and 2000. [...] In a 2004 interview, Knight said, [...] "I don't think I've ever been satisfied with a recording. [...] I haven't played all my recordings. [...] Some of them I haven't heard. [...] I haven't seen... the video that I did of Salome from Covent Garden.... erhaps when I'm not singing any more, I'll dig it out <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it....</b> I listen and I'll think, 'Yes, but I could have done this or that'".|$|E
2500|$|Ted Ownby of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture {{stated that}} he {{believes}} producers of shows such as Call of the Wildman [...] "build on preexisting stereotypes, so they don't need to build characters", and added that [...] "people of the South get frustrated at the narrow range of representations [...] ". Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, expressed his concern that the shows approach [...] "the thin line between an honest documentary and exploitative reality show". Animal Planet president Marjorie Kaplan insisted, [...] "We haven't received any negative response at all" [...] to the show. Commenting on {{the potential for the}} show to advance negative stereotypes of Southerners, Animal Planet executive Dawn Sinsel added, [...] "As with all shows that explore a subculture of America that people might not be familiar with, we're careful {{to make sure that we}} represent the talent in their true colors and not 'cover up' their natural character. Turtleman likes to catch all types of animals. We hope Ernie's carefree and loyal personality and love of animals will replace any stereotypes." [...] Brown himself commented [...] "You either like the show <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it,</b> or you don't. I'm not doing anything wrong, just cheering people up." ...|$|E
