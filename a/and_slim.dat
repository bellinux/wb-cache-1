25|$|The Japanese troops {{crossed the}} Chindwin River on 8 March.

North of Imphal, 50th Indian Parachute Brigade was defeated at Sangshak by a regiment from the Japanese 31st Division {{on its way to}} Kohima. Imphal was thus left vulnerable to an attack by the Japanese 15th Division from the north but because the diversionary attack launched by Japanese in Arakan had already been defeated, Slim was able to move the 5th Indian Division by air to the Central Front. Two brigades went to Imphal, the other went to Dimapur from where it sent a detachment to Kohima.|$|E
25|$|People who are {{unfamiliar}} with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that {{will grow up}} to be horse-sized may be no taller than some ponies in their first months of life, their body proportions are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is too young to be ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they {{grow up to be}} horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs <b>and</b> <b>slim</b> bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse.|$|E

He {{was involved in}} the planning for potential operations in Iraq where trouble was expected.

500|$|Jackson {{was seen}} as a stylish and elegant batsman, with a genius for timing and placement. His {{footwork}} was light and his supple wrists allowed him to steer the ball square and late.

He {{was seen as}} possessing the comely movement and keenness of eye of the great batsman of cricket's Golden Age, Victor Trumper. Bradman described Jackson as [...] "tall <b>and</b> <b>slim,</b> rather lethargic and graceful in his movements". Jackson professed [...] a love of applying the maximum velocity to the ball with a minimum of effort. His one identifiable fault was an occasional failing outside off-stump, being prone to unnecessarily dab at away-swingers and being caught in the slips cordon.|$|E
