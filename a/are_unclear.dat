This was the final release that occurred before Disney's death in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of local}} oceanic fauna {{is not well}} understood. Sea turtles and mammals, including monk seals, fin whales (only 1 sighting and 5 strandings have been documented in Turkish waters), and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area, although regularity of occurrences <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{etymology}} of Salwick <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b> The [...] "wick" [...] {{may come}} from Old English wic, meaning an earlier Romano-British settlement specialised in farming; but the [...] "Sal(w)" [...] element <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of laxatives for constipation in those receiving palliative care <b>is</b> <b>unclear,</b> {{as it has}} not been sufficiently studied. The comparative {{effectiveness of}} different laxatives in this group also <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> as of 2015.|$|R
50|$|Child {{pornography}} {{is considered a}} trafficking crime in Syria, but <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> if this includes simple possession. The penalties for child pornography are also unknown and it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> if anyone <b>was</b> ever prosecuted for child pornography.|$|R
5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{of relationships}} within the order {{is based on}} a 2002 molecular phylogeny using ribosomal RNA, a nuclear elongation factor gene, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. The Annulipalpia and Integripalpia are clades, but the relationships within the Spicipalpia <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{moments of}} the fight <b>are</b> <b>unclear</b> with witness {{accounts}} of the brawl either being started by Leeds fans throwing beer glasses at Galatasaray fans and insulting the Turkish flag or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs or ambushing Leeds fans with knives.|$|E

5|$|A commercially {{oriented}} work {{aimed at}} ethnic Chinese audiences, Si Tjonat received mixed reviews; box office proceeds <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b> Although {{intended as a}} serial, no sequel was ever made; the production house, Batavia Motion Picture, closed soon afterwards. However, several works in the same genre as this one were released soon afterwards, including Si Pitoeng, which used the same director and star.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{future of}} the {{lighthouse}} <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b> Though it <b>was</b> agreed upon that access to the historic lighthouse would continue, the Department of Defence, the agency governing the site, originally fenced it and access was limited. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> what the exact restrictions are at this point. The structures on the location were put on sale, and {{the outcome of this}} <b>is</b> also <b>unclear.</b>|$|R

Both the exact dates {{of the various}} eruptions and {{of the formation of}} the St. Ana and Mohos craters <b>are</b> <b>unclear,</b> partly because dates obtained by potassium-argon dating and other dating techniques deviate from each other. Some eruptions may have reached sub-Plinian strength, ejecting volcanic ash as far as the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Crook Peak {{has been}} {{important}} as a landmark and boundary from very early times, and {{the origins of the}} name <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b> The local parish council state that 'Crook' comes from the Old English 'Cruc' meaning 'peak' or 'pointed hill'. 'Shute' is a contraction of schute which meant slope in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service <b>are</b> <b>unclear,</b> {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E

Despite the widespread incidence of hybridization, {{there is no evidence}} that the two parental lineages are merging and the mechanisms preventing introgression <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b> This is the first confirmed case of hybridization among cartilaginous fishes.|$|E
5|$|I., II., and III./KG 55 {{were also}} in action. III./KG 55 bombed Heathrow Airport. Results are unknown and losses <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b> KG 55 {{suffered}} heavy losses the previous day, so its operations seemed limited. On 12 August it lost 13 Heinkel He 111s and their crews. The next day, 14 August, they would lose their Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Alois Stoeckl.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the {{container}} terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan <b>are</b> <b>unclear,</b> but redbacks {{are thought to have}} spread by walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E

The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b> Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915, {{landslides}} {{closed the}} Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including Kentuckian, {{returned to the}} Straits of Magellan route again. Kentuckians exact movements from this time through early 1918 <b>are</b> <b>unclear.</b> She {{may have been in}} the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E
