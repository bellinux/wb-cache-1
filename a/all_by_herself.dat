500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>herself.</b> She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Polyergus breviceps is {{a species}} of ant which is endemic to the United States. It is a social {{parasite}} of other ants, namely of Formica gnava but also of Formica occulta and Formica argentea. Polyergus is an inquiline parasite, having lost its ability {{to take care of}} its young and themselves. [...] "The workers do not forage for food, feed the young or the queen, or even clean up their own nest". In order to survive, Polyergus workers raid Formica nests in order to steal the pupae which once hatched, become workers of the mixed nest. This sort of relationship is not unique, of the approximately 8,800 species of ants, at least 200 have evolved some form of symbiotic relationship with one another. What makes Polyergus special is the way a newly mated queen can, <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>herself,</b> take over a Formica nest and start a new colony.|$|E
