U-boats {{could operate}} from French Atlantic ports, {{reducing}} {{their need to}} make the dangerous journey from ports in Norway or Germany around Scotland, and increasing their operational range in the ocean by several hundred miles.

25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed.

In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E

When he arrived to the East Railway Station of Warsaw, The German Luftwaffe was already bombarding the area. The passengers fled from the trains to nearby trenches. Apparently he was successfully enlisted. The next time he met his cousin Eugene Paul Baworowski in the streets of Warsaw in the first days of occupation he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in touch with the Polish Resistance. As the 6 September 1939 decree issued by the Wehrmacht command pursued every Polish citizen who reached the military age to be sent to a POW camp the Gestapo soon arrested and sent him to a camp.

25|$|On 7 April 1779, a {{few weeks}} after his {{ordination}} as a priest of the Church of England, Hackman followed Martha Ray to Covent Garden, where she had gone to watch a performance of Isaac Bickerstaffe's comic opera Love in a Village with her friend and fellow singer Caterina Galli. Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman saw her in the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into their carriage. He put one pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's body, into a tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and a love letter to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E
25|$|Local traditions {{states that}} when the village was still called Benquerença, there was a {{beautiful}} orphan princess who lived in her uncle, {{the lord of the}} castle. The princess {{fell in love with a}} noble young knight who did not possess great wealth. For this reason, the young man left the village in search of fortune, promising to return when he felt he had a worthy fortune to ask for her hand. For years, the princess refused all suitors, until her uncle promised her to a friend, forcing her to compromise. When she was presented to the uncle of her suitor, she confessed that her heart belonged to another man. This revelation infuriated her uncle, who thought of a ruse to coerce her to marry the one he chose. At night, he disguised as a ghost, and went through the ports of the Princess quarters, pretending to be the ghost of her lover, telling her to marr her suitor or otherwise be subject to damnation. As he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an oath from her, the door to her bedroom opened with a bright ray of light, exposing her uncle's treachery. She went to live in the tower and the two windows became known as the Port of Treason and the Port of Light.|$|E
