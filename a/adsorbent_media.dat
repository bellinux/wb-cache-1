The present study attempted to develop the potential magnesium oxide (MgO)-impregnated tuff soil-derived ceramic (MITDC)-based novel <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> for adsorbing higher rate of cadmium [Cd(II)] from water phase. A potential MITDC <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> was developed using volcanic raw tuff soil and its Cd(II) adsorption capacity from water phase was evaluated comparing with the raw tuff soil. A series of studies were carried out in an agitated batch method at 20  ±  2  °C to characterize the adsorption capacity of MITDC under different conditions of factors, such as contact time (0 – 360  min), initial pH (3 – 11) of solution, dose of MITDC (2, 5, 7.5 and 10  g/L), and initial concentration of Cd(II) (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40  mg/L), influencing the adsorption mechanism. MITDC exhibited the equilibrium state of maximum Cd(II) adsorption at the contact time 120  min and pH 4.7 (removed 98.2  % Cd) when initial Cd(II) concentration was 10  mg/L in the present study. The dose of 7.5  g MITDC/L showed maximum removal of Cd(II) from water. Experimental data were described by the Freundlich and the Langmuir isotherms and equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir model (R 2  =  0.996). The Cd(II) adsorption capacity of MITDC was 31.25  mg/g. The high Cd(II) adsorption capacity indicated that novel MITDC {{could be used as a}} potential ceramic <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> to remove high rate of Cd(II) from aqueous phase.|$|E

30|$|This study {{developed}} a novel magnesium oxide (MgO) MITDC, which showed {{a high rate}} of Cd(II) removal capacity compared to that of the raw tuff soil (RT) from aqueous solutions. The adsorption capacity of tuff soil was significantly improved by impregnation of magnesium oxide (5  %) and heat activation. Although adsorption equilibrium data follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, the Langmuir isotherm model fitted well with the experimental data. The capacity of Cd(II) adsorption was 31.25  mg/g, calculated from Langmuir isotherm using other optimum study conditions obtained. The present adsorption kinetics clearly revealed that Cd(II) adsorption of MITDC is largely influenced by initial pH, adsorbent amount, and initial concentration of ambient solution. The contact time 120  min, pH 4.7, and adsorbent dose 7.5 were supposed to be the optimum process parameters for maximum Cd(II) adsorption of developed novel MITDC <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media.</b> The dimension less separation factor (R L) showed that MITDC was favorable for removal of cadmium from aqueous solutions.

Filters that are packed with <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> with a high affinity for arsenic {{have been used to}} de-contaminate water - generally iron or aluminium oxides are favored materials. Recently, nanoparticles have been introduced as <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> due to their superior efficiency compared to their bulk counter-parts.

Fibres were produced at 72 C with jet head rotation speeds from 7000 to 15, 000 r min- 1. The fibres were characterised by means of SEM, XRD and DSC. Adsorption behaviour was investigated by means of an isothermal bottle point adsorption study using a commercial disperse dye, Dianix AC-E. Through centrifugal spinning nanofibers and microfibers could be produced with individual fibres as fine as 200 – 300 nm and mean fibre diameters of ca. 1 – 2 lm. The PVP/TA fibres were mechanically brittle with characteristic brittle tensile fracture regions observed at the fibre ends. DSC and XRD analyses suggested that this brittleness was linked to the graft chain crystallisation where the PVP/TA was {{in the form of a}} radial brush copolymer. In this structure, the triacontene branches interlock and form small lateral crystals around an amorphous backbone. As an adsorbent, the PVP/TA fibres were found to adsorb 35. 4 mg g- 1 compared to a benchmark figure of 30. 0 mg g- 1 for a granular-activated carbon adsorbent under the same application conditions.

The primary focus is on oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) and a secondary focus on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Thermal desorption is a technique used in the recovery of sampled airborne organic compounds from solid <b>adsorbent</b> trapping <b>media.</b> There are several advantages of this technique over solvent desorption: 1) absence of the toxic solvent; 2) greater concentration of the sample; 3) higher detection sensitivity. Most organic compounds are known to be unstable at high temperatures. The thermal stability of the organic compounds is an important parameter that must be determined before considering a thermal desorption process. Two major variables, which affect the desorption purge time when organic compounds are desorbed from a charcoal tube by thermal means, are the temperature and carrier gas flow rate. In this study, a modified gas chromatograph apparatus was used to measure the 1, 3 -butadiene desorption purge time under various desorption conditions. The thermal stability of 1, 3 -butadiene at various temperatures was also investigated by measuring the percent recovery. The most important finding {{of this study is that}} the proportion of 1, 3 -butadiene recovered decreases for the desorption temperature greater than 170 OC when zero air is used as the carrier gas. The effects of temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and charcoal quantity on the desorption purge time of 1, 3 -butadiene are summarized in detail. From these observations, it is possible to select combinations of temperatures and carrier gas flow rates that allow quantification of 1, 3 -butadiene thermally desorbed from coconut charcoal packed in the glass tubes.

30|$|CNT are {{carbonaceous}} adsorbents with hydrophobic surfaces that exhibit strong adsorption affinities {{to organic}} compounds[24 – 30]. Thereby, {{a combination of}} chemical and physical interactions {{play a major role}} for adsorption processes. CNT have uniform structural units but are prone to aggregate, forming bundles of randomly tangled agglomerates because of the strong van der Waals forces along the length axis[31]. The outermost surface, inner cavities, interstitial channels, and peripheral grooves of CNT constitute four possible sorption sites for organic compounds[30]. Nanotechnology has initiated different types of nanomaterials to be used in water technology in recent years that can have promising outcomes. Nanosorbents such as CNT have exceptional adsorption properties and can be applied for removal of heavy metals, organics, and biological impurities[28, 32]. CNT, as <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media,</b> are able to remove heavy metals such as Cr 3 +[33], Pb 2 +[34], and Zn 2 +[35], metalloids such as arsenic compounds[36], organics such as polycyclic aromatic organic compounds (PAH)[24, 29], pesticides[37], and a range of biological contaminants including bacteria[38 – 40], viruses[41, 42], cyanobacterial toxins[43, 44] as well as natural organic matter (NOM)[45 – 47].

This study explored the potential use of lowcost <b>adsorbents</b> as PRBs <b>media</b> and assessed their longevity and risk mitigation against leaching of acidic rainfall through an ewaste recycling site, of which Cu, Zn, and Pb were the major contaminants. Batch adsorption experiments suggested a higher adsorption capacity of inorganic industrial byproducts [acid mine drainage sludge (AMDS) and coal fly ash (CFA) ] and carbonaceous recycled products [food waste compost (FWC) and woodderived biochar] compared to natural inorganic minerals (limestone and apatite). Continuous leaching tests of sand columns with 10 wt% lowcost adsorbents were then conducted to mimic the field situation of acidic rainfall infiltration through ewastecontaminated soils (collected from Qingyuan, China) by using synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) solution. In general, Zn leached out first, followed by Cu, and finally delayed breakthrough of Pb. In the worstcase scenario (e. g., at initial concentrations equal to 50 fold of average SPLP result), the columns with limestone, apatite, AMDS, or biochar were effective for {{a relatively short period of}} about 20 - 40 pore volumes of leaching, after which Cu breakthrough caused noncancer risk concern and laterstage Pb leaching considerably increased both noncancer and lifetime cancer risk associated with portable use of contaminated water. In contrast, the columns with CFA or FWC successfully mitigated overall risks to an acceptable level for a prolonged period of 100 - 200 pore volumes. Therefore, with proper selection of lowcost adsorbents (or their mixture), wastebased PRBs is a technically feasible and economically viable solution to mitigate human health risk due to contaminated groundwater at ewaste recycling sites.

40|$|Currently the {{purification}} of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic purposes is {{reliant on}} protein A affinity chromatography. The {{rapid growth of}} this class of therapeutic and their high value makes the understanding of protein A chromatography an important target. There is a range of commercially available protein A chromatography media. The main differences between these media are the support matrix type, the pore size, the particle size, the amount of ligand attached to the matrix {{and the kind of}} protein A modification. The differences in these factors give rise to differences in compressibility, chemical and physical robustness, diffusion resistance and binding capacity of the <b>adsorbents.</b> The ideal <b>media</b> would have high specificity, high mass transfer and binding capacity, low non-specific adsorption and ligand leakage, incompressibility, resistance to alkaline condition for sanitization, chemical stability and cost effectiveness. Current resins offer a compromise, which balances what is achievable in respect of these features giving rise to an array of different solutions. Measurement of these parameters is often complex and agreed standards have yet to be determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} further develop understanding of these measurements for the assessment of the matrix performance. This thesis employs a suite of techniques to characterise commercial and prototype adsorbents. The adsorbents that will be looked at are MabSelect (GE Healthcare), MabSelect Xtra (GE Healthcare), Prosep Ultra (Millipore), Protein A immobilised on 4 CL Sepharose (GE Heatlhcare) in house and a prototype adsorbent with a Protein A mimic ligand (Millipore). Both down-scaled techniques of fixed bed chromatography, together with supporting analysis of equilibrium and dynamic behaviours are used. The latter will adopt standard and novel ‘wet chemistry’ approaches together with the increasingly adopted techniques of laser scanning confocal microscopy. Experiments are carried out using hIgG to study the static capacity, adsorption equilibrium and dynamic capacity of adsorbents. Other techniques will be used to study the kinetic uptake and desorption rates of adsorbents in different conditions. A novel approach using confocal microscopy is used to further understand the adsorption behaviour of individual beads of different sizes. The main results that were drawn from these techniques are that MabSelect Xtra had the highest static capacity of 61. 8 mg/ml. It also showed the highest dynamic capacity at 2 mins, 4 mins and 8 mins residence time (0. 66 cm Omnifit column, bed height 6 cm) when compared to other adsorbents. This is mainly due to the more porous nature of the MabSelect Xtra beads, which increased the surface area available for Protein A ligand immobilisation. From the adsorption equilibrium data the Kd values ranged from 181 nM to 36 nM. Such low values are expected by affinity adsorbents such as these. The uptake rate curves were similar for all the adsorbents. Hence the difference in particle size, pore size, the type of ligand or the material of the adsorbent itself did not have an effect on the uptake rate when carried out in a batch mode. A similar behaviour was shown for the desorption curves. The confocal analysis using a flow cell showed that all the adsorbents showed a shrinking core effect except for the prototype where the hIgG didn’t penetrate into the bead and was only attached to the surface of the bead. It was found that the adsorption rate to the centre of each bead was linear. The different particle sizes within any particular type of matrix and also across different matrix did not result in different diffusion rates. From the adsorption curves produced it was seen that smaller beads reached saturation much faster than larger beads at any given time. This technique can have great benefits in understanding how individual beads of different adsorbents behave in different circumstances. ...|$|R

In Sweden, the construction of the constructed wetlands has been one of the environmental objectives for wastewater quality improvement in the small communities. However, the insufficiently understanding of the mechanisms underlying the process of phosphorus mobility and sorption in the constructed wetlands has limited design of the effective constructed wetlands. To provide the better understanding of sorption process in the catchment and constructed wetland system, this thesis used the GIS-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict phosphorus mobility and identify the critical diffusing sources of phosphorus loss in the Oxunda catchment (Paper I). Then, the study developed the three-dimensional numerical Reactive TRAnsPort Model (RETRAP - 3 D) in the COMSOL Multiphysics® for evaluating the long - term sorption processes and removal efficiencies of the porous reactive media for upgrading the performance of constructed wetlands (Paper II and III). The latter model coupled many physics equations to solve process of water flow, reaction kinetics and solute transport in the porous reactive <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> for application in the constructed wetlands. The data from the field measurements and column experiments have been used to demonstrate the model simulation accuracy to capture the process of phosphorus sorption in the real environment. Modeling results ranked the phosphorus removal efficiency of the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> as follows: Polonite® (88 %), Filtralite P® (85 %), BFS (62 %), Wollastonite (57 %).

40|$|Waters {{draining}} {{the area of}} the epithermal high sulfidation gold deposit at Furtei, Sardinia (Italy) show the typical trend of increasing “heavy metal ” load with decreasing pH. In the primary (hypogene) assemblage, pyrite and enargite/luzonite are the most abundant sulfides. Therefore, the copper and arsenic contents of waters interacting with highly mineralized rocks could be controlled by enargite. However, in such waters, Cu/As molar ratios are different from those of enargite. In surface, oxygenated waters, they are much higher. Hence, copper is more mobile than arsenic in these conditions. This is in agreement with 1) the composition of secondary minerals found at the mine, the Cu-bearing minerals being in general more soluble than the As-bearing ones; 2) laboratory experiments suggesting that under some conditions acidic solutions remove more easily copper than arsenic from enargite. On the other hand, in subsurface, reduced waters, Cu/As ratios are lower, probably because reducing conditions do not allow the formation of iron oxy-hydroxy-sulfates that may act as <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> for arsenic species...|$|E

In {{the context of the}} ongoing MEMORI project, which is funded under the seventh framework programme, laboratory trials have been performed in order to evaluate the applicability of <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> inside of museum enclosures for improving microclimates within preventive conservation strategies. A range of different kinds of activated charcoal, charcoal cloth, zeolithes and silica gel has been subjected to test series under active and passive conditions (with/without air exchange) in order to identify the most effective adsorbent materials. Formaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, toluene and alpha-pinene have been selected as target substances due to their known corrosive impact on cultural assets as weil as due to their frequent occurrence in museum environments. The article summarizes the research results which revealed clear differences between the filtration efficiency of the tested media, also concerning the mitigation of specific target substances.

The effects of operational parameters such as bed height, flow rate, and initial concentration {{on the length}} of mass transfer zone, breakthrough time, exhaustion time, and adsorption capacity at breakthrough were evaluated. With increasing bed height and decreasing flow rate and initial concentration, the breakthrough and exhaustion time were observed to favorably increase. Moreover, the adsorption capacity at breakthrough was observed to increase with decreasing initial concentration and flow rate and increasing bed height. The maximum adsorption capacity at breakthrough of 13. 49 [*]mg/g for Pb(II), 12. 14 [*]mg/g for Cu(II), and 10. 29 [*]mg/g for Ni(II) was attained at an initial influent concentration of 200 [*]mg/L, bed height of 2. 0 [*]cm, and flow rate of 0. 4 [*]mL/min.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of several microporous virus-adsorbent media for reliably detecting {{low levels of}} poliovirus from 380 and 1, 900 liters of drinking water by use of the tentative standard method was investigated. The virus-adsorbent media tested were (i) nitrocellulose membrane filters, (ii) epoxy-fiber glass-asbestos filters, (iii) yarn-wound fiber glass depth filters, and (iv) epoxy-fiber glass filter tubes. Virus was adsorbed to the filter media at pH 3. 5 and eluted with glycine buffer, pH 11. 5. The results from 44 samples demonstrated that poliovirus was detected with a 95 % reliability at mean virus input levels of 3 to 7 plaque-forming units/ 380 liters when 1, 900 liters of water was sampled. At mean virus input levels of less than 1 to 2 plaque-forming units/ 380 liters, the detection reliability was 66 % in 76 samples when 1, 900 liters of water was sampled. No significant difference in virus detection sensitivity was observed among the various virus <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> tested. Overall virus recovery efficiency ranged from 28 to 42 %, with a grand average of 35 %.

40|$|The {{aluminium}} content in dewatered aluminium-coagulated water treatment residual (DAC-WTR) {{can lead to}} a high phosphorus (P) removal capacity. Therefore, DAC-WTR has been used as adsorbent/soil amendment to remove P in several studies, focusing mostly on orthophosphates (ortho-P). This study is concerned with extending such reuse of DAC-WTR to remove P using a condensed phosphate as the model P source. Using a 48 -hr equilibration time and a 1. 18 mm (mean particle size); (1) P removal was found to increase with increasing DAC-WTR dosage, but specific uptake of P per mass of DAC-WTR was decreased (2) A maximum adsorption capacity of 4. 52 mg-P/g of DAC-WTR was obtained at a pH of 4. 0. In the continuous flow test, P removal efficiency decreased from 90 to 30 % when loading was increased from 3. 9 to 16. 5 g-P/m 2. d. An average 45 % removal efficiency was obtained after an intentional P loading surge. At the end of the continuous flow test, an operating removal capacity of 2. 66 mg-P/g of DAC-WTR was determined which was 83. 3 % of the adsorption maxima obtained in the batch tests. There was no excessive loss of solids during the continuous flow test and {{aluminium content}} in the effluent remained below 0. 1 mg-Al 3 +/l.

40|$|Arsenic {{has been}} {{classified}} as a toxic and carcinogenic chemical element. It therefore presents a serious environmental problem in {{different regions of the}} country and the world. In the present work, two <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> were developed and evaluated to remove arsenic from water in the Pájaro Verde mine shaft, Huautla, Tlaquiltenango, Morelos. The media were synthesized and characterized, obtaining a surface area of 43. 04 m 2 ·g− 1 for the goethite and 2. 44 m 2 ·g− 1 for silica sand coated with Fe(III). To conduct the sorption kinetics and isotherms, a 23 factorial design was performed for each medium in order to obtain the optimal conditions for the factors of arsenic concentration, pH and mass of the adsorbent. The best results were obtained for goethite, with a removal efficiency of 98. 61 % (C 0 of As(V) 0. 360 mg·L− 1), and an effluent concentration of 0. 005 mg·L− 1, a value that complies with the modified Official Mexican Standard NOM- 127 -SSA 1 - 1994 [1] and WHO guidelines (2004) [2]. The kinetic equation that best fit the experimental data was the pseudo-second-order, resulting in the highest values for the constants for synthetic goethite, with a rate constant sorption of 4. 019 ·g·mg− 1 ·min− 1. With respect to the sorption isotherms, both media were fitted to the Langmuir-II linear model with a sorption capacity (qm) of 0. 4822 mg·g− 1 for goethite and 0. 2494 mg·g− 1 for silica sand coated with Fe(III) ...|$|E
30|$|Mining and {{smelting}} {{processes of}} lead and zinc, nickel–cadmium batteries, polyvinyl chloride plastics, paint pigments, insecticides, fungicides, and commercial fertilizer industries {{are the primary}} sources for causing Cd contamination {{as well as for}} causing the aforesaid tremendous environmental and human health risks. However, the effluent of Cd is a big environmental problem, since Cd is variously used as important component in producing different commodities required for daily life of human. In recent years, therefore, Cd removal from industrial wastewater is an important issue. Various technologies, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration, carbon adsorption, and co-precipitation, have been developed for the removal of heavy metals and many other pollutants (such as dyes) from aqueous solution over the years (Kentish and Stevens 2001, Saleh and Gupta 2012 a, Gupta et al. 2012 a, b). Adsorption is one of the effective techniques in removing Cd from wastewater (Aggarwal et al. 1999; Bhakta and Munekage 2009) because its sorption process largely depends on surface area, porous character, and chemical nature of adsorbent. Various relatively low-cost adsorbents have been developed and used for the removal of Cd and other various heavy metals [Such as Lead (Pb), Mercury (Hg), Cupper (Cu), etc.] from aqueous solution (Sari and Tuzen 2009) such as silica ceramic (Salim et al. 2008), chitin (Benguella and Benaissa 2002), wood (Rafatullah et al. 2012), granular red mud (GRM) (Zhu et al. 2007 a, b), fertilizer waste-derived activated carbon (Gupta et al. 1998), Mn 2 O-loaded D 301 resin MITDC and RT (Zhu et al. 2007 a, b), alumina-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Gupta et al. 2011), and manganese dioxide-coated multiwalled carbon nanotube (Saleh and Gupta 2012 b). Soil, mud, waste materials, and its derivatives have great potential as inexpensive and efficient sorbents of various pollutants including metals and dyes due to their easy availability, chemical and mechanical stability, high surface area, and favorable structural properties (Gupta et al. 1998, Mittal et al. 2009 a, b, 2010, Mittal et al. 2010, Vakili et al. 2014). Bhakta and Munekage (2013) identified some soil adsorbents including tuff soil (Meadow soil association, Japan) as potential media for removing hazardous metal(loid)s (cadmium, lead, and arsenic) from water phase. The studies also proved the ceramics derived from soil is a promising media for removing heavy metals from water (Bhakta and Munekage 2009; Bhakta et al. 2009). There is an upsurge of interest in recent years to utilize natural minerals for the remediation of Cd-contaminated environment (Gupta and Bhattacharyya 2006; Lackovic et al. 2004). It has also been proposed that tuff soil has high Cd removal ability from water (Bhakta and Munekage 2013). However, no study has been attempted so far to develop the magnesium oxide (MgO)-impregnated tuff soil-based low-cost ceramic <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> in order to remove the high rate of Cd from aqueous medium. Therefore, this study has firstly attempted to develop a potential tuff soil-based low-cost novel ceramic <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> impregnating MgO for the removal of higher rate of Cd(II) from aqueous phase. The higher Cd(II) removal capacity of developed ceramic was evaluated comparing with the raw tuff (RT) under different conditions of physicochemical factors influencing the adsorption mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} the ability of novel nanostructured <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> (NTAs, iron sulfides (FeS 2 and FeS)) to remove arsenic, selenium and mercury from ash and scrubber pond effluents. The NTAs aim to enhance arsenic removal from solution compared to conventional adsorbents. The iron sulfides are expected to produce stable residuals for ultimate disposal after removing As, Se and Hg from solution, so that removal of these compounds from wastewaters will not result in contamination of soils and groundwaters. Methods for reliably and economically producing these materials were developed. The synthesized NTAs and iron sulfides were characterized by surface analysis techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, TEM, XPS, AFM and N 2 -adsorption. These analyses indicated that Ti(25) -SBA- 15 has highly ordered hexagonal mesopores, MT has interparticle mesopores, pyrite (FeS 2) forms crystalline, nonporous rectangular nanoparticles (< 500 nm), and mackinawite (FeS) forms amorphous, nonporous nanoparticles (< 100 nm). Kinetic and equilibrium tests for As(III, V) removal were conducted with NTAs over a range of pH (4, 7, 9. 5). The rates of arsenic uptake were very fast and followed a bi-phasic sorption pattern, where sorption was fast for the first 10 minutes, and then slowed and was almost completed within 200 minutes. Distinct sorption maxima for As(III) removal were observed between pH 7 and pH 9. 5 for MT and between pH 4 and pH 7 for Ti(25) -SBA- 15. The amount of As(V) adsorbed generally decreased as pH increased. In addition, a surface complexation model (SCM) based on the diffuse layer model (DLM) was used to predict arsenic adsorption envelopes by NTAs under various environmental conditions. The SCM for As(III, V) adsorption by NTAs demonstrated the role of mono- and bidentate surface complexes in arsenic adsorption. A batch reactor system was employed in an anaerobic chamber to conduct experiments to characterize both the removal of As, Se, Hg from solution and their subsequent reactions with iron sulfides. Experiment variables for removal experiments included: contaminant valence state (As(V), As(III), Se(VI), Se(IV), Hg(II)); adsorbent/reactant type (FeS, FeS 2); adsorbent/reactant concentration; pH (7, 8, 9, 10); and competing ion (SO 42 -) concentration (0, 1, 10 mM). Experimental variables for reaction experiments were reaction time (up to 30 days) at pH 8 and oxidation states of contaminants. In addition, the stability of iron sulfides (FeS 2, FeS) combined with target compounds was investigated by measuring the ability of the target compounds to resist release to the aqueous phase after removal. These experiments showed that iron sulfides were good adsorbent/reactants for target contaminants in spite of the presence of sulfate. This was particularly true at intermediate concentrations of target compounds. The experiments also demonstrated that iron sulfides interacted with target contaminants in such a way to improve their resistance to being released back to solution as pH was changed. Therefore, this study demonstrates the ability of novel nanostructured <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> to remove arsenic, selenium and mercury from ash and scrubber pond effluents and the ability of iron sulfides to produce residuals that are stable when disposed in landfills...|$|E
40|$|A {{spacecraft}} is {{the ultimate}} tight building. We don t want any leaks, and {{there is very little}} fresh air coming in, says Jay Perry, an aerospace engineer at Marshall Space Flight Center. As a result, there is a huge potential for a buildup of contaminants from a host of sources. Inside a spacecraft, contaminants can be introduced from the materials that make spacecraft components, electronics boxes, or activities by the crew such as food preparation or cleaning. Humans also generate contaminants by breathing and through the body s natural metabolic processes. As part of the sophisticated Environmental Control and Life Support System on the International Space Station (ISS), a trace contaminant control system removes carbon dioxide and other impurities from the cabin atmosphere. To maintain healthy levels, the system uses <b>adsorbent</b> <b>media</b> to filter chemical contaminant molecules and a high-temperature catalytic oxidizer to change the chemical structure of the contaminants to something more benign, usually carbon dioxide and water. In the 1990 s, while researching air quality control technology for extended spaceflight travel, Perry and others at Marshall were looking for a regenerable process for the continuous removal of carbon dioxide and trace chemical contaminants on long-duration manned space flights. At the time, the existing technology used on U. S. spacecraft could only be used once, which meant that a spacecraft had to carry additional spare parts for use in case the first one was depleted, or the spacecraft would have to return to Earth to exchange the components...|$|E
