500|$|The first {{screenplay}} Griffith wrote was Cardula, a Dracula-themed story {{involving a}} vampire music critic. After Corman rejected the idea, Griffith says {{he wrote a}} screenplay titled Gluttony, in which the protagonist was [...] "a salad chef in a restaurant who would wind up cooking customers <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that, you know? We couldn’t do that though because of the code at the time. So I said, “How about a man-eating plant?”, and Roger said, “Okay.” By that time, we were both drunk." ...|$|E

500|$|Keaton's casting {{caused a}} {{controversy}} among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. [...] "Obviously {{there was a}} negative response from the comic book people. I think they {{thought we were going}} to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration.|$|E

The best I could do would be to describe it like this— they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter! That's Paris–Roubaix.

500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little while {{to get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|Markley and Lloyd {{did not get}} on, {{which led}} to the latter leaving the group and Morgan joining full-time. According to Lloyd, Markley became {{increasingly}} overbearing on the WCPAEB's creative output, and [...] "he started to believe that he was like, you know, the real deal, as opposed to the guy who doesn't sing and doesn't really have any musical thoughts <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that. He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it". Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and Mike Curb such as October Country, the Smoke, St. John Green, and the Fire Escape.|$|E
500|$|In post-production, Wan {{found he}} did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was {{basically}} shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. [...] "We did {{a lot of things to}} fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever we cut to newspaper clippings <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to still photography within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E

500|$|Matheos {{spent seven}} months writing {{material}} for the album. He then sent Kevin Moore (who was living in Costa Rica) some MP3 files of the music he had written {{and asked him to}} write some keyboard parts. Moore (known as a founding member of Dream Theater and for his solo career as Chroma Key) had previously performed on three Fates Warning albums, and Matheos was expecting him to write keyboard parts as he had for the Fates Warning album. Instead, Moore [...] "messed with [...] tracks and switched things around and put vocals to it <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] He said that he no longer considered the keyboard, bass and guitar parts separate from each other: [...] "I don't write like that any more as much as I'm composing a whole song." [...] The resulting track would become [...] "Hello, Helicopter!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{was largely}} raised by her grandmother, {{who had been}} Michael Jackson's {{personal}} hairstylist for over 30 years. She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've never said anything [...] because I don't want it to define me, but I feel like it's appropriate to say something [...] People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|E
500|$|After {{turning down}} {{a number of}} record labels, the band signed to The Enclave, a record label run by A {{executive}} Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed Guns N' Roses to Geffen. Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that. I did vocals at different times. But we really wanted to get a live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E
500|$|About the {{re-recording}} {{of the old}} songs, Westfall said [...] "We've made a lot {{of changes}} to these songs that we play live [...] and now we're getting a chance to record it, so the people that don't get to see us live can hear it and appreciate it for what it is." [...] On the new tracks, producer Andrew Wade said [...] "I think this new stuff that we're recording is really gonna blow a lot of kids away. [...] just sound amazing, they all sound like completely different songs, and the new song is serious." [...] About the new song, [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", the band wanted to do a fast-paced song. McKinnon admitted the band [...] "kinda just winged it. But we had some little ideas from being on tour and messing around." [...] Woodard said about inspiration for the tempo of the song: [...] "We've all been listening to a lot of faster stuff like Comeback Kid <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that and I don't know and just sitting here one day 'let's write a fast song'." [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had appeared on the band's Myspace account, on September 21, 2007, as free for download. [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had overdubs added to it especially for the release on the For Those Who Have Heart reissue.|$|E
500|$|In early 1991, Anthony Field founded The Wiggles, a children's music group, {{with fellow}} {{university}} students Murray Cook and Greg Page, Phillip Wilcher (from Macquarie University's music department) and The Cockroaches' band mate, Jeff Fatt. In July, they issued their debut album, The Wiggles, which {{was dedicated to}} Paul Field's daughter and sold 70,000 copies. The Wiggles {{went on to become}} [...] "a global powerhouse in children's entertainment". They used former The Cockroaches' members for musical and performing support: Paul, John, and Henry (The Wiggles' character Henry the Octopus was named after him) performed with them on their CDs, DVDs, and stage shows. John helped them write many of their songs. Many early The Wiggles' songs were The Cockroaches' tunes reworked to fit the genre of children's music. According to Anthony, [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what we did in The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter... The Cockroaches sing about girls and love <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti". Paul worked for James Roland Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, for three years after the band stopped regularly performing and during The Wiggles' formation, which he said gave Anthony time to develop his new band alone, without much input from his brothers. In the mid-1990s, Paul became The Wiggles' talent manager.|$|E

English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing."

He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that.
