5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of natural {{selection}} creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform. The processes by which the changes occur, {{from one generation to}} another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection (including sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> migration due to genetic admixture. Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> migration create variation.|$|E

5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms.

40|$|Small fibrils termed actinotrichia are {{involved}} with the growth {{and structure of the}} fin fold during fin development in fish. The actinodin (<b>and)</b> <b>genes</b> are required for actinotrichia formation, and the loss of these genes from the genomes of tetrapods has been implicated in the tetrapod-specific loss of actinotrichia, loss of a fin fold and the concurrent evolution of paired fins into limbs. This study focuses on the function of the <b>and</b> <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> their role in actinotrichia formation. The results reveal cis-acting regulatory elements required for and 1 expression in the fin epithelium. Furthermore, it is shown that the And proteins display similarities to the secreted signaling molecule, Ecrg 4, implying a possible role in cell differentiation during fin fold development. In the final section of this report, I use a genomic analysis to show that the <b>and</b> <b>genes</b> were lost from otherwise well-conserved syntenic loci in fish and tetrapod genomes. These results suggest possible causes for the evolutionary loss of <b>and</b> <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> the associated developmental changes that may have permitted fin to limb evolution...|$|R

5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television <b>and</b> <b>Gene</b> Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{susceptibility}} to intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) often arises from mutations {{in the same}} genes, suggesting that they share common mechanisms. We studied genes with de novo mutations in the three disorders <b>and</b> <b>genes</b> implicated in SCZ by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Using biological annotations <b>and</b> brain <b>gene</b> expression, we show that mutation class explains enrichment patterns more than specific disorder. Genes with loss-of-function mutations <b>and</b> <b>genes</b> with missense mutations were associated with different pathways across disorders. Conversely, gene expression patterns were specific for each disorder. ID genes were preferentially expressed in the cortex; ASD genes were expressed in the fetal cortex, cerebellum, <b>and</b> striatum; <b>and</b> <b>genes</b> associated with SCZ were expressed in the adolescent cortex. Our study suggests that convergence across neuropsychiatric disorders stems from common pathways that are consistently vulnerable to genetic variations but that spatiotemporal activity of genes contributes to specific phenotypes...|$|R
