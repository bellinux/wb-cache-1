50|$|In the US, large globe {{artichokes}} are frequently prepared by removing all but 5 - 10 mm {{or so of}} the stem. To remove thorns, which may interfere with eating, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is boiled or steamed. A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour, reminiscent of fried egg white. The core of the stem tastes similar to the <b>artichoke</b> <b>heart,</b> and is edible.|$|R

Here, I sowed my first seeds, tended my first garden, brought in my first harvest, and canned tomatoes and raspberry applesauce. Deeper learning about nutrition and the earth came from local farmers, and from direct studies with Ann Wigmore, mother of raw foods and wheat grass; Michio Kushi, father of macrobiotics; Dr. Paavo Airola, European naturopath; Dr. Jeffrey Bland, biochemist; and Dr. Bernard Jensen, who searched the world to prove that for every ailment, nature has a remedy.

Iz lišća i jestivog dijela glavice artičoke ekstrahirane su topljive te ionski i kovalentno vezane peroksidaze. Elektroforezom je dobivena karakteristična slika, pri čemu su topljive i ionski vezane peroksidaze imale gotovo isti, a kovalentno vezane sasvim drukčiji raspored. U topljivim i kovalentno vezanim peroksidazama nađeno je nekoliko kiselih i lužnatih izoformi, a u ionski vezanim samo lužnate. Toplinska stabilnost pojedinih peroksidaza ispitana je pri različitim temperaturama (70, 80, 90 i 100 °C). Izoforme iz lišća pokazale su veću termostabilnost od onih iz glavice artičoke.
