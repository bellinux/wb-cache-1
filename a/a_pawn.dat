5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pawn</b> moves {{straight}} forward one square, if that square is vacant. If {{it has not}} yet moved, <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> also has the option of moving two squares {{straight forward}}, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.|$|E

5|$|Today some of {{the sharpest}} opening {{variations}} have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as drawing weapons. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, a line where Black sacrifices <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> for strong attacking chances, to obtain an endgame where Black is still <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> down but is able to draw with correct play.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> knight <b>pawn</b> {{should be}} on at least the fifth rank to have good winning chances. <b>A</b> knight <b>pawn</b> on the fifth rank has better winning chances than <b>a</b> rook <b>pawn</b> on the sixth rank. There are two reasons for this: ...|$|R
5|$|If {{a player}} moves <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> to its eighth rank, it cannot be {{substituted}} for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square.|$|E
5|$|Pawns are {{the only}} pieces that capture {{differently}} from how they move. <b>A</b> <b>pawn</b> can capture an enemy piece on {{either of the two}} squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).|$|E
5|$|When <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} original square and ends the turn adjacent to <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> of the opponent's on the same rank, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, {{as if it had}} moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.|$|E
2500|$|In {{king and}} <b>pawn</b> endings, <b>an</b> extra <b>pawn</b> is decisive {{in more than}} 90 {{percent of the cases}} [...] [...] Getting <b>a</b> passed <b>pawn</b> is crucial (<b>a</b> passed <b>pawn</b> is one which does not have <b>an</b> {{opposing}} <b>pawn</b> on its file or on adjacent files on its way to promotion). Nimzovich once said that <b>a</b> passed <b>pawn</b> has <b>a</b> [...] "lust to expand". An [...] is particularly deadly. The point of this is a decoy – while the defending king is preventing it from queening, the attacking king wins pawns on the other side.|$|R
40|$|A debt deposit is a movable {{property}} and <b>a</b> <b>pawned</b> deposit object. Article 1154 of the Civil Code states that “in {{the case of}} a debtor is default, the creditor has the right to own the pawn property, and all contracts on this case are null and void. ” A creditor 2 ̆ 7 s practical reason to execute <b>a</b> <b>pawned</b> deposit is by asking the debtor to make an unconditional power of attorney for him to cash the deposit underhandedly. A profound study is needed to be conducted in order to analyze the execution of <b>a</b> <b>pawned</b> time deposit since the regulation on pawned deposit has not been adequate so far, and there is no specific and detailed regulation on it. Moreover, the binding of <b>a</b> <b>pawned</b> time deposit made by both a creditor and a debtor is submitted to both of them, while the payoff is depended on their underhanded agreement. The underhanded agreement is made based on the principle of freedom to enter into a contract...|$|R

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous European states, was little more than <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> of its neighbors (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|The en passant capture {{rule was}} {{added in the}} 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It {{prevents}} <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> from using the two-square advance to pass an adjacent enemy pawn without {{the risk of being}} captured.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} for enpassant was {{to prevent the}} newly added two-square first move for pawns from allowing <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> to evade capture by an enemy pawn. Asian chess variants, because of their separation from European chess prior to that period, do not feature any of these moves.|$|E
50|$|In {{the diagram}} at right, the white pawns on b5, c4, and e5 are passed pawns. Black's pawn on d4 is <b>a</b> passed <b>pawn.</b> If Black plays fxg4, then Black {{will also have}} <b>a</b> passed <b>pawn</b> on g4, and White will have <b>a</b> passed <b>pawn</b> on f4.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> central <b>pawn</b> {{has better}} chances to win than <b>a</b> rook <b>pawn</b> or knight pawn, {{but not as}} good as <b>a</b> bishop <b>pawn.</b> <b>As</b> with the bishop pawn, there is no drawing zone for the {{defending}} king in the opposite corner. It is better for the defending king to be on the [...] "short side" [...] of the pawn rather than the [...] "long side" [...]|$|R
50|$|Out of {{the rook}} pawn (1. P-2f) first move games, 50.7% had <b>a</b> rook <b>pawn</b> advance as White's {{response}} and 48.8% had <b>a</b> bishop <b>pawn</b> response.|$|R
5|$|A {{successful}} {{demonstration of}} this last idea {{occurred in the}} game Pintér–Brynell at the 1998 Elista Olympiad. White answered Black's 21...b5 with 22.b4!, and Black was unable to keep the queenside open with 22...bxa4? because 23.bxc5 Rxb1 24.Rxb1 dxc5 25.Bxc5 would have left White's central pawns unstoppable. After the game's 22...c4 23.a5! Qe7 24.Bd4 Black's queenside play had ground to a halt; Pintér later won with <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> advance on the kingside.|$|E
5|$|Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar {{the names}} of {{important}} members of the Obregón cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> for the Juárez Cartel, the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit.|$|E
5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E
5000|$|According to Reuben Fine and Pal Benko, this ending is a draw {{unless the}} <b>pawn</b> is <b>a</b> bishop <b>pawn</b> or <b>a</b> central <b>pawn</b> (i.e. king pawn or queen pawn) and the pawn {{is in the}} seventh rank and is {{supported}} by its king. If the defending king can {{get in front of}} the pawn, the game is a draw; otherwise it is best for the defender to keep his king far away from the pawn. The defender should keep checking until he runs out of check, and then pin the pawn [...] Based on computer analysis, Müller and Lamprecht give a different description. According to them, normally the defending king needs to be in front of the <b>pawn.</b> <b>A</b> rook <b>pawn</b> or knight <b>pawn</b> is <b>a</b> theoretical draw if the defending king is in front or near the pawn or if the king is in the corner opposite the pawn's promotion square. <b>A</b> knight <b>pawn</b> has more practical winning chances than <b>a</b> rook <b>pawn.</b> <b>A</b> bishop <b>pawn</b> or central <b>pawn</b> is <b>a</b> win if the defending king is not in front of the <b>pawn.</b> <b>A</b> bishop <b>pawn</b> has better winning chances than <b>a</b> central <b>pawn.</b> The position of the defending king is especially important [...] John Nunn states that analysis since Fine's initial work (published in 1941 in Basic Chess Endings) has shown that there are many more winning positions than were known at that time (ignoring the fifty-move rule in some cases) [...] Wins by the side with the pawn take up to 59 moves [...] A cross-check may be necessary to win.|$|R

5|$|Continuing {{immediately}} after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, {{and the other}} Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him nothing more than <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|For {{example in}} the Alekhine variation, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6 6.Nf3, the move 6...Bb4+ (see diagram at right) is good because White has no good reply apart from 7.Nc3. Indeed, 7.Nbd2? just loses <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> after 7...Nxf4 whereas 7.Bd2?! Qe7! causes White great problems: both the pawn f4 and e4 pawns are attacked, and 8.Bxb4 Qxb4+ results in a double attack against b2 and f4. After 7.Nc3 Black can either answer with 7...Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 or with 7...Qf6, {{simultaneously}} attacking c3 and f4.|$|E

If it were invested in <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E

5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues. Both supported progressive reforms such as the direct election of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, {{and the creation of a}} public utilities commission. McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be <b>a</b> <b>pawn</b> of Beckham and his allies.|$|E
