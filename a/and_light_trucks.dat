The production of flex-fuel cars and light commercial vehicles since 2003 reached 10million vehicles in March 2010, and 15million in January 2012.

Production passed the 20million-unit mark in June 2013. By the end of 2014, flex-fuel cars represented 54% of the Brazilian registered stock of light-duty vehicles, while gasoline only vehicles represented 34.3%. , flex-fuel light-duty vehicle sales totaled 25.5million units.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks.</b> The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E

25|$|Since 1976 the Brazilian {{government}} has made it mandatory to blend ethanol with gasoline, and since 2007 the legal blend is around 25% ethanol and 75% gasoline (E25).

Autoracks were built in three-level configurations carrying automobiles, and with two-levels for vans <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|E

By early 2013, about 11 million E85 flex-fuel cars <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> were in operation, though actual use of E85 fuel was limited, because the ethanol fueling infrastructure was limited.|$|E

25|$|Although {{sales of}} SUVs <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> were booming in the U.S., Japan's car {{manufacturers}} dismissed {{the idea that}} such a trend could occur in their own country. Nakamura, however, increased the budget for sport utility product development, and his gamble paid off; Mitsubishi's wide line of four-wheel drive vehicles, from the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini kei car to the Delica Space Gear passenger van, rode the wave of SUV-buying in Japan {{in the early to}} mid-1990s, and Mitsubishi saw its overall domestic share rise to 11.6 percent in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} in the United States are the second largest flex-fuel fleet in the world after Brazil, and there were about 17.4million flex-fuel cars <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> in operation {{by the end of}} 2014. Despite the growing fleet of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, actual use of ethanol fuel is limited {{due to the lack of}} E85 refueling infrastructure and also because many American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex-fuel vehicle. Flex-fuel vehicles are common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Also the U.S. government has been using flex-fuel vehicles for many years.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{his first}} {{guardrail}} designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1955, {{the state}} doubled tolls to $1.80 round trip for cars and $4.00 {{or more for}} trucks {{in order to pay}} for repairs, new toll booths, and a new punched card system {{compatible}} with the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. The toll plazas, which had numbered three - one for each bridge - were consolidated to two, one {{at the south end of}} the main bridge and one at the north end of the Nansemond River Bridge. Thus the Crittenden Bridge became free for local traffic. In addition, passenger vehicles <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> only had to pay at the first booth they reached; large trucks and buses had to pay twice. This meant that light vehicles crossing only the main bridge (for instance between Smithfield and Newport News) only had to pay southbound.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998 a {{total of}} 15.1 million E85 flex fuel {{vehicles}} had been sold or lease in the United States through December 2012. Of these, about 11 million flex-fuel cars <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> were still in operation as of early 2013, up from 7.3 million in 2008, 4.1 million in 2005, and 1.4 million on U.S roads in 2001. E85 flex-fuel vehicles are becoming increasingly common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Also the US government has been using flex-fuel vehicles for many years. Since 2008 almost any type of automobile and light duty vehicles {{is available in the}} market with the flex-fuel option, including sedans, vans, SUVs and pick-up trucks.

25|$|In {{the first}} five months of 2010, auto sales in the U.S. rose to 4.6million cars <b>and</b> <b>light</b> <b>trucks,</b> an {{increase}} of 17% from a year earlier. The rise was mainly caused by the return of commercial customers that had all but stopped buying in 2009 during the recession. Sales to individual customers at dealerships have increased 13% while fleet sales have jumped 32%. Ford reported that 37% of its sales in May came from fleet sales when it announced its sales for the month increased 23%. In the first seven months of 2010, vehicle sales of Ford increased 24%, including retail and fleet sales. Fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%. Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.|$|E
