5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E

25|$|The city prospered as {{it became}} a more {{important}} port, and eventually sea captains who had made their fortunes began {{to settle down and}} build larger houses for themselves.

25|$|The loss of {{the naval}} fleet in 1971 was a serious blow to the economy, and {{eventually}} the city controversially authorized the removal of many old factories, warehouses, and historic structures <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> {{just west of the}} district boundary for the construction of retail facilities such as Brick Market Place and Long Wharf Mall, hotels, condominiums and America's Cup Avenue, a multilane through street whose name reflected the sloop races that then drew crowds to the city every few years.|$|E

25|$|Thompson's {{decision}} to defect to the North West Company in 1797 without providing the customary one-year notice {{was not well}} received by his former employers. But the North West Company was more supportive of Thompson pursuing his interest in surveying and work on mapping the interior {{of what was to}} become Canada, as they judged it in the company's long-term interest. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-US boundary <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty between Great Britain and the United States after the American Revolutionary War.|$|E

25|$|Bonnie Haneline, in 1977, recounted a {{time during}} her {{childhood}} in 1944 {{when she was}} exploring the cave. She left English class, playing 'hooky,' and borrowed a lantern from Mrs. Garrison, the cave owner. She reported to have explored the cave with her friends for several years. While she was inside, her lantern blew out despite no breeze inside the cave. She managed to relight the lantern and it blew out again. Terrified, she crawled <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> path of the cave in the dark until she reached the entrance where she saw an opened can of pork and beans and marshmallows. Later that evening, she learned law enforcement discovered two escaped fugitives {{in the back of}} the cave. She credited the witch with helping her avoid them.|$|E
25|$|Pier 53, a {{very short}} pier {{just north of the}} ferry {{terminal}} near the foot of Madison Street, is the site of Seattle Fire Station No. 5, at 925 Alaskan Way. The present 1963 building is the third fire station at this address and the fourth to serve the Central Waterfront. The fire department used to play a particularly critical role on the waterfront: not only were the piers all made of wood; until federal money helped pay {{for the construction of a}} seawall in 1934, so was the road <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> (prior to that Railroad Avenue, after that Alaskan Way). The Great Seattle Fire of 1889 had consumed the piers as far north as Union Street along with the rest of the heart of the city.|$|E
25|$|During summer, the old hill had a lake, {{which made}} it {{possible}} to use the amphitheater for concerts, plays and entertainment. The venue was then often referred to as Sommerkollen. From 1963, a temporary, small in-run was built down the southern grandstand, which allowed skiers and divers to make a jump and land in the water. Between 1963 and 1983, a competition was held nine times. Starting in 1983 was Ta sjansen, which was televised annually by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and became Sommerkollen's most popular show. It was an informal competition with two main events: one where a home-made craft was to first slide down a short in-run and then slide <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface to hit a mounted bell in the shortest possible time. The other was a cycling competition where the cyclist had to complete a track on a wobbly floating wharf.|$|E

500|$|In New Jersey, {{flooding}} largely occurred {{north of}} Trenton {{and west of}} Perth Amboy; rainfall in the southern twothirds of the state was less than [...] The three major rivers in the area - the Delaware, Passaic, and Raritan - had severe flooding, and damage was widespread. When the Millstone River flooded, two teenagers drowned while canoeing, and a police officer drowned while attempting to rescue them. About 200families were evacuated in Oakland along the Ramapo River. Damage in the state was heaviest along the Delaware from Port Jervis, New York to Trenton, where flooding inundated adjacent towns. Between the two towns, all but two bridges were damaged, including four that were destroyed. About 500children had to be rescued from camps on three islands in the Delaware River; they were airlifted to {{a high school in}} Frenchtown. In that city, about 200people were forced to evacuate their houses <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> In Trenton, workers used sandbags to prevent flooding from affecting government buildings. Flooding destroyed the Portland–Columbia Pedestrian Bridge, first constructed in 1831, after most of it was submerged. The center of the Northampton Street Bridge between Easton, Pennsylvania and Phillipsburg, New Jersey collapsed. A dam near Branchville collapsed, flooding the town and causing heavy damage. About 200homes were damaged or destroyed in Lambertville. Statewide, 93homes were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $27.5million.|$|E
