5000|$|Other {{refinements}} {{to improve}} cassette performance included Tandberg's DYNEQ, Toshiba's [...] and Telefunken's High Com, and on some high-end decks, automatic recording bias, fine pitch adjustment and (sometimes) head <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{such as the}} Tandberg TCD-330 and TCD-340A.|$|E
5000|$|In later {{auto reverse}} machines, the [...] "auto reverse" [...] {{mechanism}} uses an ordinary two-track, quarter-width head, but operates by mechanically rotating the head 180 degrees {{so that the}} two head gaps access the other tracks of the tape. There is usually an <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment</b> screw for each position. Nevertheless, due to the repeated movement, the alignment (in particular, the azimuth) deviates with usage. Even in a machine with a four channel head, slight asymmetries in the cassette shell {{make it difficult to}} align the head perfectly for both directions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Nakamichi {{introduced}} {{a line of}} car stereo products. The flagship product was the TD-1200 cassette receiver which incorporated a drawer-mounted, top-loading cassette mechanism with NAAC (like the Dragon), Dolby B and Dolby C. Other early products included the TD-700 cassette receiver with manual <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment</b> (like the Cassette Deck 1, Cassette Deck 1 Limited, DR-1 and the CR-7), a power amplifier and speakers. In the early 1990s, Nakamichi {{was one of the}} first companies to produce automotive CD changers that loaded multiple discs via a single slot rather than a CD cartridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{triangular}} {{base frame}} of the antenna is made from structural steel. It rotates on wheels about a center pintle ball bearing on a turntable track 30 feet (10 m) in diameter. The track consists of stress-relieved, planed steel plates which are individually adjusted to produce a track which is flat to about 1/64 inch (0.4 mm). The faces of the wheels are cone-shaped to minimize contact friction. A tangential force of 100 pounds (400 N) is sufficient to start the antenna rotating on the turntable. The antenna beam can be directed to {{any part of the}} sky using the turntable for <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustments</b> and the elevation wheel to change the elevation angle or altitude above the horizon.|$|R

5000|$|Adobe Audition is able {{to remove}} the effect using the Graphic Panner tool (the Automatic Phase Correction tool is unable to {{accurately}} do this) by manually selecting the [...] "Phase -90 degrees" [...] preset. The [...] "Auto Center Phase" [...] and [...] "Learn Phase" [...] features will also work, but are not recommended. There are sometimes slight offsets caused by various mixing effects and, to a lesser extent, tape-head misalignment; studio reverb or naturally decaying reverb is a prime example. As a waveform decays in a large room, it naturally changes phase. In Auto Center phase, this is (generally) shown as the upper frequencies making a drastic change. Tape head misalignment (azimuth) also will cause a phase change in upper frequencies. One {{should be aware of}} this when attempting to remove Haeco processing and not use auto-phase options. <b>Azimuth</b> alignment <b>adjustment</b> tools can however be used AFTER Haeco has been removed.|$|R
50|$|Drift {{alignment}} is {{a method}} to refine the polar alignment after a rough alignment is done. The method is based on attempting to track {{stars in the sky}} using the clock drive; any error in the polar alignment will show up as the drift of the stars in the eyepiece/sensor. Adjustments are then made to reduce the drift, and the process is repeated until the tracking is satisfactory. For the polar axis altitude adjustment, one can attempt to track a star low in the east or west. For the <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment,</b> one typically attempts to track a star close to the meridian, with declination about 20Â° from the equator, in the hemisphere opposite of the observing location.|$|E
50|$|Later {{helically}} scanning recorders instead usually use {{a method}} called slant-azimuth recording, also called symmetric phase recording. The head drum usually contains two heads with the magnetic gap of one head slanted slightly leftwards and the magnetic gap {{of the other}} head slanted slightly rightwards. (The slant of a magnetic head {{is referred to as}} its <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment).</b> Because of the alternating slants, each head will not wrongly read the signal recorded by the other head and the stripes can be recorded immediately next to each other, alternating between left slant on one television field and right slant on the next television field. (In practice, it's not uncommon for the recorded stripes to overlap somewhat). Later machines including the JVC VHS and the Sony Betamax use slant-azimuth recording as well as all later machines and their digital derivatives.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} a head depends on whether it is fixed or rotating. In either case, {{the face of the}} head where the gap is must be made hard wearing and highly smooth to avoid excessive head wear. It can also be seen that due to the construction method of the head gap, head wear will tend to widen the gap, reducing the head's performance over time. The vertical alignment of the heads (the azimuth) must also match between recording and playback for good fidelity, and the gap should be as close to exactly vertical as possible for highest frequency response. Most tape transport mechanisms will allow fine mechanical adjustment of the azimuth of the heads. Sometimes this can be achieved by automatic circuitry - the actual mechanical <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment</b> being carried out by taking advantage of the piezo effect of certain types of crystal material.|$|E
40|$|In this work, a new sun-tracking {{concept was}} proposed, and the optical {{performance}} of solar panels with such sun-tracking system was theoretically investigated {{based on the}} developed mathematical method and monthly horizontal radiation. The mechanism of the proposed sun-tracking technique is that the azimuth angle of solar panels is daily adjusted three times at three fixed positions: eastward, southward and westward in the morning, noon, and afternoon, respectively, by rotating solar panels about the vertical axis (3 A sun-tracking, in short). The analysis indicated that the tilt-angle of solar panels, [beta] 3 A, azimuth angle of solar panels {{in the morning and}} afternoon from due south, [phi]a, and solar hour angle when the <b>azimuth</b> angle <b>adjustment</b> was made in the morning and afternoon, [omega]a, were three key parameters affecting the optical performance of such tracked solar panels. Calculation results showed that, for 3 A tracked solar panels with a yearly fixed tilt-angle, the maximum annual collectible radiation was above 92 % of that on a solar panel with full 2 -axis sun-tracking; whereas for those with the tilt-angle being seasonally adjusted, it was above 95 %. Results also showed that yearly or seasonally optimal values of [beta] 3 A, [phi]a and [omega]a for maximizing annual solar gain were related to site latitudes, and empirical correlations for a quick estimation of optimal values of these parameters were proposed based on climatic data of 32 sites in China.

5000|$|In the CD era (post 1983), the {{top line}} Nakamichi {{products}} were termed the [...] "Dragon." [...] The Dragon-CT turntable ("Computing Turntable") automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records {{by moving the}} platter in two dimensions. The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD, and holds multiple CDs. The Dragon cassette deck used a special microprocessor controlled <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment</b> called Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction (NAAC) {{to find the best}} sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. The solution (thought by some to be a gimmick) was to automate the manual turnover of tape; in other words eject the tape and flip it around to maintain proper tape head alignment. Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the Akai GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to [...] "actually" [...] use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the alignment error for each axis. Once alignment error is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star offset position to make the mount adjustment. The star offset position is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the alignment error such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called âstar offset positioning â and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis Alignment Error [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar alignment error. If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and <b>azimuth</b> <b>adjustment</b> axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|E
