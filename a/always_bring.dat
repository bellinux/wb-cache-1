5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E

[...] But this originality does not <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: [...] "Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do." [...] His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design. Pei refers to his own [...] "analytical approach" [...] when explaining the lack of a [...] "Pei School". [...] "For me," [...] he said, [...] "the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements... to arrive at an ideal balance among them." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Prism {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "Perry and her longtime collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin often go for a darker, moodier intimacy à la high-end Swedish divas Robyn and Lykke Li. Perry has always {{done a great job}} of letting us know she's in on the joke of pop stardom. Sadly, she doesn't <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> that same sense of humor and self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it".|$|E
500|$|The cast also {{included}} a number of actors who were to become stalwarts of the future films, including Bernard Lee, who played Bond's superior M for another ten films, and Lois Maxwell, who played M's secretary Moneypenny in fourteen instalments of the series. Lee was chosen because of being a [...] "prototypical father figure", and Maxwell after Fleming thought she was the perfect fit for {{his description of the}} character. Maxwell was initially offered a choice between the roles of Moneypenny or Sylvia Trench and opted for Moneypenny as she thought the Trench role, which included appearing in immodest dress, was too sexual. Eunice Gayson was cast as Sylvia Trench and it was planned that she would be a recurring girlfriend for Bond throughout six films, although she appeared only in Dr. No and From Russia with Love. She had been given the part by director Terence Young, who had worked with her in Zarak and invited Gayson saying [...] "You <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> me luck in my films", although she was also cast due to her voluptuous figure. One role which was not given to a future regular was that of Major Boothroyd, the head of Q-Branch, which was given to Peter Burton. Burton was unavailable for the subsequent film, From Russia with Love, and the role was taken by Desmond Llewelyn.|$|E

Shirley Li of Entertainment Weekly was positive in her {{assessment of the}} song, describing it as [...] "catchy". Lars Brandle of Billboard gave a positive review, noting its [...] "catchy, radio-friendly chorus." [...] Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin magazine that Artpop gets [...] "a lot artier" [...] with [...] "Venus". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times expressed that its [...] "throbbing disco-glam" [...] groove [...] "feels like a throwback to her 'Just Dance' days", calling it [...] "fun, kind of, but hardly extraordinary." [...] Spencer Kornhaber commented in The Atlantic that with the song packing four separate choruses, it makes the music sound [...] "enormous". Christina Lee of Idolator gave a positive review, saying that [...] "'Venus' doesn't waste a single moment dealing with subtlety or nuances of any kind. 'Venus' swings like a pendulum from one emotional extreme to another, from its deadpan hashtag rap to its glittering dance balladry." [...] John Walker of MTV Buzzworthy called the song [...] "crazy, otherwordly, barely intelligible sense, but still — sense!" [...] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse described [...] "Venus" [...] as [...] "a track just weird and stupid and messy and catchy enough to work." [...] He compared the chorus to that of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] adding that [...] " [...] no matter how weird Gaga gets with her music [...] she'll <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> it back to that undeniably massive pop chorus." ...|$|E

500|$|Coming Up to Breathe {{received}} positive reception {{from music}} critics. Steve Losey of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "In a concerted effort to revert back to the days when they were more a rock band and less of a hitmaking machine, MercyMe delivers. While it's certainly not heavy metal, the songs definitely keep driving forward. Guitars are more prominent and production leans on a more earthy formula... MercyMe is able to rock on portions of each song but they <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> it back to a memorable chorus or a hooky verse. That's the formula that has always worked for them, and it does here, too". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted that [...] "For the most part, MercyMe has built a multiplatinum foundation on compelling power ballads. But on this set, the Texas band rocks out with passion and edgy intensity. It doesn't stray so far that it would alienate the faithful, but it delivers a powerful collection of pop/rock that should take the band's career to a new level". She also praised Millard's vocals and called it a [...] "landmark album in an already impressive career". Mark Joseph of CCM Magazine gave the album a B-; he called the album [...] "enjoyable" [...] but suggesting that a stronger producer or A team would have resulted in better lyrics. Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars, praising the vocals and string arrangements as well as the choir on [...] "Bring the Rain". Russ Breimeier of The Fish called Coming Up to Breathe MercyMe's [...] "best album to date" [...] and an [...] "impressive {{step in the right direction}} for a band that many have pegged to be too formulaic", but derided the album's [...] "simplistic songwriting".|$|E

[...] To improve their chances, wolves pick out moose which are calves, old, diseased, or injured. The typical moose killed is about 12 years old and suffers from arthritis, osteoporosis, and/or periodontitis. [...] Eighty to ninety percent of moose are brought down by wolves rather than directly by disease, and each wolf kills an average of between 0.44 and 1.69 moose per month.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{or not it}} is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian {{mechanics}} deals {{only with}} caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will <b>always</b> <b>bring</b> one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, [...] "uncertainty" [...] was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.|$|E
