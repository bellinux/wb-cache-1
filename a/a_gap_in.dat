5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15–16 mya. This makes Apeomyoides the {{youngest}} known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps close <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in Nevada and Arikareeomys in Nebraska. Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E

Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E

Shea, was {{to fight on}} the ancient battlefield between Arsuf and the Nahr el Faliq, where in 1191 King Richard defeated Saladin and avenged Hattin. Shea's infantry division was to advance to establish a bridgehead across the Nahr el Faliq and create <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the front line for the cavalry. Then the 60th Division was to advance north-east to capture Tulkarm and cut the railway line east of it.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Villers-Bocage {{took place}} during the Second World War on 13 June 1944, one week after the Normandy Landings by the Western Allies that began the conquest of German-occupied France. The battle {{was the result of a}} British attempt to improve their position, by {{exploiting}} <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the German defences west of the city of Caen. After one day of fighting in and around the small town of Villers-Bocage and a second day defending a position outside the town, the British force retired.|$|E
5|$|The next German {{attack was}} in force, using the 2nd Battalion 857th Grenadier Regiment, the 1st and 2nd Battalion's 858th Grenadier Regiment and several {{companies}} of the 744th Grenadier Regiment with tank and armoured car support.

5|$|The working {{title was}} 24: Exile. The {{concept of the}} film started since the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for a year thus leaving <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the series during 2008. Redemption was {{somewhat}} inspired by the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. The majority of Redemption was filmed on location outside Cape Town, South Africa since {{it was difficult to}} mimic an authentic African scenery in America.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

5|$|As the Byzantines {{relied upon}} the Ghassanids {{to cover the}} {{approaches}} to Syria, Mundhir's withdrawal left <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the Byzantine southern flank, which persisted for three years until 575 when Mundhir returned to the Byzantine allegiance through the mediation of the general Justinian, who met Mundhir at Sergiopolis. Immediately after this reconciliation, Mundhir assembled an army in secret and launched an attack against Hirah, the Lakhmid capital, arguably the Arab world's largest, richest, and most culturally vibrant city at the time. The city was sacked, plundered, and put to the torch, except for the churches. According to John of Ephesus, Mundhir donated much of his booty from this expedition to monasteries and the poor. The same year, Mundhir visited Constantinople, where he was awarded a crown or diadem (stemma), marking the formal renewal of his role as Byzantium's chief Arab client-king.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were {{sizeable}} Preclassic {{cities that}} survived into the Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record the probable enthronement {{of a king}} of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this there is <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events of this period may be either {{due to the fact}} that the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or perhaps that the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Briar Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet {{in western}} Briar Creek Township. It flows east {{for a short}} {{distance}} before turning south through <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> Lee Mountain, briefly descending quite steeply. The course levels out as it leaves the mountain behind and begins flowing through a valley after a short distance. It flows under Pennsylvania Route 93, leaving the valley behind. Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch Briar Creek and turns southeast. After some distance, it enters the community of Briar Creek {{and picks up the}} tributary East Branch Briar Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island.|$|E
5|$|Danny, {{aware that}} the Oceanic Flight 815 {{survivors}} are responsible, takes his anger out on Sawyer by violently beating him; Sawyer refrains from fighting back. Kate pleads with him to stop; Danny ceases only after Kate admits to loving Sawyer. Afterwards, Kate notices <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> her cage, and manages to climb through. She tries to free Sawyer, but he bitterly refuses, remembering Karl's escape and bloody capture. Kate returns to her cage, insisting {{that she would not}} abandon him, and tells Sawyer that she lied about loving him so that Danny would stop.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
