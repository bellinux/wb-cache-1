30|$|Another {{comparison}} {{example is}} sentences “Register Account” and “Account registered”. Both {{of the two}} sentences have sensitive keywords “Register” and “Account”, but the meanings of them are significantly different. The former one describes an account registration manner but the latter one is a hint message saying that the account is already registered. All the related approaches can correctly identify the former sentence but fail for the latter sentence. As we are not sure if an <b>action</b> <b>check</b> is compulsory or not in Whyper, we here assume it is not compulsory so that Whyper correctly identifies the sentence. S 3 first identifies the sensitive noun phrase “Account” which makes up a CBNP. It then analyses that the CBNP has a sibling action (verb phrase) “registered” which does not dominate the noun phrase. As a result, S 3 correctly identifies it as insensitive.|$|E

40|$|A speedy {{restoration}} {{of a power}} system can minimize {{the consequences of a}} total or partial blackout. Due to the increase in system reliability, major disturbances occur less frequently and consequently system operators receive little experience in restoration. Power system operators seldom get working knowledge of {{restoration of}} a whole system from their daily work. However, system operators can be trained to handle the necessary steps of restoration {{with the help of a}} simulation program. This research attempts to address this need. In this research, a simulation program named as Intelligent Training Agent (ITA) has been developed to train system operators the steps of power system restoration. An object-oriented approach has been utilized to develop the graphical user interface of the simulation program. A case-based reasoning approach has been applied to form the required knowledge base of the simulation program and to perform the reasoning task. Several numerical analysis algorithms have been used to verify the restoration actions. By using the case-based reasoning mechanism, the proposed intelligent agent can provide a restoration plan when the initial system conditions are known and the goal state of the system is submitted to the ITA. System operators, therefore, can interact with the agent through the object-oriented graphical interface. The interface will enhance the operator's learning process. The structure of the agent consists of an object-oriented graphical interface block, a case-based reasoning block, and an <b>action</b> <b>check</b> block...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify operators′ error in distillation units of Isfahan oil refinery. Materials and Methods: Data were collected through task observation and interviewing with safety authorities, the unit and the shift supervisors and operators to identify and analyze critical tasks hierarchically (hierarchical task analysis). Then, human errors of each critical task were identified using systematic human error reduction prediction approach (SHERPA) technique. Results: Analysis of the SHERPA work sheets revealed 198 human errors of which 134 (67. 64 %), 23 (11. 61 %), 11 (5. 6 %), 24 (12. 12 %), and 6 (3. 03 %) were <b>action,</b> <b>checking,</b> communication, retrieval, and selection errors, respectively.

30|$|With a {{significant}} sectional loss in tensile reinforcement, {{and if the}} tensile stresses in the affected steel are relatively high (beyond yield but still under the ultimate stresses), high local axial deformations in the tensile reinforcement are expected. This would result in widening of the flexural cracks, accelerating the local damage and concrete spalling. Furthermore, {{the formation of an}} arch action would increase the compressive stress in the “bond-failure” zone. When the structural member is subjected to axial compression in addition to bending moment (in beam-columns), the tensile stresses in the tensile steel could be significantly reduced. Hence, the stress redistribution mechanisms could not be developed, and the effects of losing the bond in the corrosion affected zone could marginally affect the lateral deformations. In the present study, the focus is on beam-columns of slab-on-girder bridges that are subjected to axial load and moment {{as a result of the}} load eccentricity. For the proposed NLFEA, the equilibrium is satisfied at the sectional and the element levels taking into account the redistribution of the stresses due to the formation of the arching <b>action,</b> <b>checking</b> whether the bond stress level exceeds the bond strength in non-corroded zones (active bond zone as shown in Fig.  4 a).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate how Saudi mathematics trainee primary teachers {{respond to their}} students’ contributions {{and the reasons for}} their actions. Also, to outline the possible influence of teachers’ knowledge, both subject matter knowledge (SMK) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), on their handling of students’ contributions. To achieve these goals five participants were observed for eight lessons each and interviewed. The data from three out of the five participants formed three case studies of teachers with differences in terms of their SMK and PCK. Three lesson observations for each case plus the interviews were analysed. The Knowledge Quartet framework was used to analyse the data in order to highlight the knowledge of the trainees and to direct attention towards the incidents where the teachers responded to the students’ answers. The interactions in these incidents were also analysed by the (Initiation-Response-Feedback) IRF tool to classify the teachers’ responses in relation to the students’ contributions. The findings suggest that the trainees responded to the students’ answers usually with one of two types of response. Confirmation actions in which the teachers confirmed the correctness or the fault of a given answer and questioning actions where the teachers asked further questions usually before making a decision about the answer. They reasoned their ways of accepting correct answers into two types of reasons: class-focused and individual-focused actions. Conversely, the teachers’ justification of their rejection of incorrect answers fell into three groups: protection <b>actions,</b> <b>checking</b> <b>actions</b> and other. Moreover, the teachers’ SMK and PCK have influenced their response to the students’ answers. Their response approach was mainly shaped by the teachers’ beliefs of how mathematics is best learnt whereas PCK influenced the quality of their responses. Also, they depended mainly on their SMK, and to some extent on their PCK, in deciding to accept or reject answers...|$|R
