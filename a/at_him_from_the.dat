5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Louis van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} {{and within the}} first two minutes forced Manchester United defender Gary Neville to concede a throw-in. In the fifth minute, Manchester United won a free kick, but nothing {{came out of it}} as José Antonio Reyes blocked Paul Scholes's shot. Good play by Reyes and Henry {{fashioned}} a chance for Bergkamp in the ninth minute, but his strike was off target. Two minutes later a shot by Bergkamp from outside the box was saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard. Before Henry was about to take a corner for Arsenal in the 16th minute, a cigarette lighter was thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> section occupied by Manchester United supporters – this resulted in police making two arrests during the game. Quinton Fortune used his pace to get the better of Lauren, but his cross into the Arsenal penalty area was cleared by Pascal Cygan. Arsenal continued to threaten – Henry's free kick prompted Howard to make a save and tip the ball over the crossbar, and Bergkamp came close to scoring in the 27th minute after clever play to lose his marker John O'Shea. The football continued to move {{from one end to the}} other, with Giggs and Reyes causing problems for their respective defences. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, Henry had his shot saved by Howard, while Scholes was similarly denied by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.|$|E

5|$|Once the Confederates {{had crossed}} the river, the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their {{crossing}} more difficult. Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and {{the main body of}} the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the Alice Dean went under the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposite side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns. The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.|$|E

Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E
25|$|In April 1994, Cantona {{was awarded}} the 1994 Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year Award by his fellow professionals. Cantona had been banned from March until October 1995 for aiming a flying kick at a spectator gesturing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Palace crowd as he walked off the field after being sent off for a {{straight}} red card offence shortly after half time during a League game on Wednesday 25 January 1995 at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace. In April 1996, Cantona {{was awarded the}} Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year Award, for both his on-field contributions, and his exemplary behaviour following the Selhurst Park incident.|$|E

500|$|Israel entered {{one male}} tennis player into the Olympic tournament. Dudi Sela (world no. 65) {{qualified}} {{directly to the}} event {{as one of the}} top 56 eligible players in the ATP World Rankings , making him the first Israeli to compete in the men's singles tournament since 1992, when Gilad Bloom lost his second round match to Jim Courier of the United States. In the round of 64, Sela won both sets 6–4 against Damir Džumhur from Bosnia. During the hour and a half match, there was a five-minute stoppage when Dzumhur claimed fans were cursing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd. [...] Sela failed to advance following the round of 32 after being beaten by David Goffin (ranked 13th in the world) from Belgium 3–6 in both sets.|$|E
500|$|Nix {{praised the}} game's sound design, {{describing}} it as [...] "far and away above {{what would be}} expected on the Game Boy Color." [...] He noted, for example, that [...] "there are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth — cutting left will sound differently than the backswing or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy." [...] Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi-Wan's Adventures for its interesting gameplay {{and the use of}} the lightsaber. She commented: [...] "There are quite a few things to like about this game. For one thing, you can't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber. Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> banks. While you're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner, there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Schlesselman, 18, of Helena-West Helena, Arkansas, and Daniel Cowart, 20, of Bells, Tennessee, {{allegedly}} plotted {{to assassinate}} Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign. Both neo-Nazis, Schlesselman and Cowart {{were introduced to}} each other via the Internet in September 2008 by a mutual friend who shared their white supremacist beliefs. Within a month they began planning to kill Obama by driving their vehicle toward him {{as fast as they}} could and shooting <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> windows. The murder was planned as the final act of violence of a killing spree in which the men planned to kill 88 African Americans by gunfire, mostly children at an unidentified, predominantly black school. They also planned to behead 14 of the 88 victims. The numbers were chosen for their special significance in the white power movement; 88 means [...] "Heil Hitler", since H is the eighth letter in the alphabet, and 14 represents the 14-word white supremacist mantra, [...] "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." ...|$|E

500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland {{smiles at}} himself in the mirror. BOB stares back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E

2500|$|Howard {{continued}} his attempts at gaining show business experience by {{singing in a}} bar with his older brother Shemp until their father {{put a stop to}} it, and in 1914, by joining a performing troupe on a Mississippi River showboat for the next two summers. In 1921, he joined Ted Healy in a vaudeville routine. [...] In 1923, Moe saw Shemp in the audience during a theater performance and yelled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stage. Shemp responded by heckling Moe, and the two brothers' amusing bickering during the performance resulted in Healy immediately hiring Shemp Howard as a permanent part of the act.|$|E
