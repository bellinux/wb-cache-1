When {{the station was}} illuminated by sunlight, several solar <b>arrays</b> mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the nickel-cadmium storage batteries installed throughout the station. The <b>arrays</b> rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the <b>arrays.</b> When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the <b>arrays</b> were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the <b>arrays</b> recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.|$|E

A third, dorsal panel was launched on Kvant-1 and mounted on the core module in 1987, providing a further 2kW from a 22m2 (237ft2) area. Kvant-2, launched in 1989, provided two 10m (32.8ft) long panels which supplied 3.5kW each, whilst Kristall was launched with two collapsible, 15m (49.2ft) long <b>arrays</b> (providing 4kW each) which were intended to be moved to Kvant-1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the EO-8 crew in 1991.|$|E
