5|$|Skåne was a Danish {{province}} without heraldic arms {{before its}} transfer to Sweden in 1658, and its arms, granted in 1660, {{are based on}} the city of Malmö's Danish era arms. The Malmö arms were granted in 1437 during the Kalmar Union by Eric of Pomerania and contains a Pomeranian griffin. The Skåne coat of arms was created for the funeral of Charles X Gustav of Sweden in 1660, and it is typically represented with a ducal coronet. The coat of arms for the new Skåne County, formed in 1997, was based on the arms of Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County, which in turn were based on the province arms (both former counties were divided from the old Skåne province); the Skåne County arms are the province arms with different colors.

40|$|Primary {{production}} control {{of food in}} Sweden How does the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> work with improvements?     Author: Mikaela Stenlund   Abstract The county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> are the responsible administrative authority for the primary {{production control}} of food in Sweden. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> work with improvements on primary production control of food, compared to some aspects from the Swedish National Audit Office report RIR 2014 : 12 and if any improvements can be seen at the present time. A survey was performed to find out if any improvement had been made. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions about food control, registration, control frequency, cooperation, resources and competence. 18 of the 21 county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> answered the survey. The result from the survey indicate improvements in some fields of the primary production control of food, compared to the report RIR 2014 : 12. Areas that indicated improvements are an increased control frequency of registered primary production producers and that there were an increased proportion of registrations of the primary production producers that are required to register. Cooperation between the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> in addition to contacts for advice and support also indicated improvements.     Keywords: primary production, food control, official control, cross complienc...|$|R

40|$|To {{ensure that}} animals are treated well {{and kept in}} environments fitted for them, Sweden has animal welfare legislation. One of the {{requirements}} in the legislation is that horses are kept in spaces that has a ceiling height that measures at least 1, 5 * the height at the withers of the horse, but always a minimum of 2, 2 m. But a minor derivation can be accepted from these measurements if certain criteria are fulfilled. If the ceiling height is to low the ventilation in the stable can be negatively affected. It can also affect the posture of the horse and may {{increase the risk of}} the horse being injured. Horses are prey animals that flee in situations of potential danger. If a horse perceives danger in a stable they may hit the ceiling when trying to flee, if the ceiling height is too low. The horse can also hit the ceiling when swinging its´ head. The competent authorities that control animal welfare in Sweden on regional level are the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards.</b> As control authorities they perform controls on animal housings. If the housing does not meet up with the legislation standards the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> can issue injunctions to the responsible person. If this person does not agree with the injunctions it can be appealed. In this study the aim was to investigate if there were any differences between the different county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards,</b> regarding number of issued injunctions and sizes of deviations in the injunctions, concerning ceiling height in horse stables. Another aim was to investigate the outcome when the injunctions were appealed. The results of this study show that the numbers of issued injunctions differ between the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards.</b> The size of deviations in the injunctions also differed, between 5, 5 cm and 62 cm. There are also differences in policies, towards ceiling height for horses and minor deviation, between the different county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards.</b> Both regarding to how big an acceptable deviation can be and from which required measurements the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> consider that they can accept deviation from (2, 2 m or 1, 5 * height at the withers). More over the results show that the county administrative boards´ injunctions held well when appealed. The reasons to why the number of injunctions and sizes of deviations differ between the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> are discussed. Possible solutions to coordinate the county administrative boards´ policies are also given. The same legislation applies to all counties of Sweden and the horses in all counties have the same need for sufficient ceiling height. It is therefore important that all the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> have similar policies. Future research is needed to investigate how horses are being affected by a low ceiling and how the county <b>administrative</b> <b>boards</b> differ in other areas that can affect the animal welfare in Sweden...|$|R
