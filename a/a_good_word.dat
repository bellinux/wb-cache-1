5|$|When Copeland {{received}} a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Reso went with him. They faced off in an untelevised tryout match, which Copeland was booked to win. After the tryout, Copeland {{signed a contract}} with the WWF. Once Copeland was promoted from his developmental status to touring with the WWF, he put in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> for Reso and got him invited to the WWF-affiliated Dory Funk, Jr.'s Funking Conservatory training camp in 1998. After completing his training at the conservatory, Reso {{signed a contract with}} the WWF to become a full-time performer.|$|E
5|$|The duo of Hardcastle and Cage {{were known}} as Hard Impact before {{changing}} their name to The Suicide Blondes. They also worked in Japan under the name The Canadian Rockers. Copeland also wrestled briefly as Damon Striker against Kevin Sullivan and Meng on separate episodes of WCW Pro. In the summer of 1995, he worked a show in Ajax, Ontario, where Bret Hart's business manager, Carl De Marco, was watching. Impressed, he suggested Copeland send an audition tape to the WWF. Copeland did not hear back from WWF, but some time later, De Marco was appointed President of WWF Canada and told Copeland that he'd put in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> for both men at the WWF.|$|E

5|$|Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{learns that}} Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), {{the head of}} William McKinley High School's glee club has been fired for {{inappropriate}} sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders (Ben Bledsoe). The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return that he put <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies.|$|E

Furthermore, the parts assigned for her perform were classical and required carefully stylized emotions, while she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy. Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> for her with the National Minister of the Arts, Camille Doucet. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the Théâtre Français, who offered Bernhardt a place as a pensionnaire at the theater, at a minimum salary.|$|E

500|$|Some {{contemporary}} observers {{thought they}} detected a [...] "prima donna" [...] streak in Eden's attitude and appearance. For example, the aging Earl of Crawford and Balcarres (1871–1940), a snob, thought him [...] "vain as a peacock {{and all the}} mannerisms of a petit maître [...] ".

[...] The Piccards struggled to gain financial support until the Grigsby-Grunow Radio Company advanced them several thousand dollars. The Detroit Aero Club and People's Outfitting Company also backed them. To supplement their sponsorship, Jeannette designed and sold commemorative stamps and souvenir programs and folders. She also raised a good deal of money by selling their story in press releases to the North American Newspaper Alliance.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{joining the}} cast of Holby City as Joseph, Luke Roberts made a guest {{appearance}} in the series seven episode [...] "No Pain, No Gain" [...] as Daniel Fryer, {{the son of a}} deceased patient. Roberts was approached about returning in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Tom Chambers as Sam Strachan. Although his guest appearance constituted a single scene, Roberts believes it was enough to secure his call-back for the part of Joseph. He recalls that it [...] "got the attention of the producers", and that actress Amanda Mealing, who portrayed Connie Beauchamp, [...] "put <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> in for [...] ". He felt lucky to join alongside Chambers and Rosie Marcel as Jac Naylor, due to the [...] "feeling of solidarity" [...] which developed between them.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Stanford did {{not seriously}} {{consider}} studying anywhere else. Neither Dublin nor London offered any comparable musical training; {{the most prestigious}} British music school, the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), {{was at that time}} hidebound and reactionary. He was dismayed to find in Leipzig that Bennett had recommended him to a German pedant no more progressive than the teachers at the RAM. Stanford said of Reinecke, [...] "Of all the dry musicians I have ever known he was the most desiccated. He had not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> for any contemporary composer... He loathed Wagner ... sneered at Brahms and had no enthusiasm of any sort." [...] Stanford's biographer Paul Rodmell suggests that Reinecke's ultra-conservatism may have been unexpectedly good for his pupil [...] "as it may have encouraged Stanford to kick against the traces." [...] During his time in Leipzig Stanford took piano lessons from Robert Papperitz (1826–1903), organist of the city's Nikolaikirche, whom he found more helpful.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary and near-contemporary chroniclers were {{generally}} negative in their attitudes towards Gaveston, blaming the royal favourite {{for many of}} the problems of the reign. Gaveston was accused of such various crimes as draining the treasury, orchestrating the arrest of treasurer Walter Langton, and filling the court with foreigners. According to the Lanercost Chronicle, [...] "There was not anyone who had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> to say about the king or Piers." [...] Nevertheless, the chroniclers did not deny that he had certain good qualities. Irish chroniclers were appreciative both of his military and his administrative skills during his period in Ireland. Likewise, Geoffrey the Baker called him [...] "graceful and agile in body, sharp witted, refined in manner, [...] sufficiently well versed in military matters". Marlowe, however, focused exclusively on the negative aspects of Gaveston's biography, portraying him – according to Hamilton – as [...] "a sycophantic homosexual with a marked tendency towards avarice, nepotism, and especially overweening pride". This was the impression that lived on in the popular imagination.|$|E

500|$|New Musical Express {{journalist}} Nick Kent jammed occasionally {{with the}} band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. [...] "When I came along, I {{took one look}} at him and said, 'No.That has to go,'" [...] Lydon later explained. [...] "He's never written <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> about me ever since." [...] In September, McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, with a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook [...] "created a smokescreen" [...] by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a [...] "Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders" [...] (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene). Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created a new sense of solidarity among the four band members. Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.|$|E

[...] Reflecting back on the period in 1939, Iorga himself noted: [...] "Shame that in this literary world of ours, guided by groups and interests, that poor man never heard <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>word</b> for that consuming labor of his and for his true talent, inherited from his father." ...|$|E
