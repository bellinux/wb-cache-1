500|$|Although most stories {{submitted}} to Super Science Stories were rejects from the better-paying markets such as Astounding Science Fiction, Pohl recalled {{in his memoirs}} that John W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding, would occasionally pass on a good story by a prolific author because he felt readers {{did not want to}} see the same authors in every issue. [...] As a result, Pohl was able to print L. Sprague de Camp's Genus Homo, in the March 1941 Super Science Stories, and Robert Heinlein's [...] "Let There Be Light" [...] and [...] "Lost Legacy" [...] in the May 1940 and November 1941 issues: these were stories which, in Pohl's opinion, [...] "would have looked good anywhere". [...] Pohl also suggested that Campbell rejected some of Heinlein's stories because they contained mild references to sex. [...] A couple of readers did complain, with one disgusted letter writer commenting [...] "If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to print such pseudosophisticated, pre-prep-school tripe as [...] "Let There Be Light", you should change the name of the mag to Naughty Future Funnies".|$|E

Instead a message {{in place of the}} video read: [...] "This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Rebecca Black. Sorry about that." [...] A spokesman for Rebecca Black said her legal team had asked YouTube to take the video down because of an ongoing legal dispute with the song's producers Ark Music Factory. Ark Music Factory responded by saying it was disappointed that Black decided to have the video pulled from YouTube despite the two parties being in [...] "good faith negotiations". It added: [...] "There's been an ongoing, open dialogue with our company. So we were blindsided to get a 'Take Down Notice' alleging copyright infringement instead of a call or e-mail from Rebecca's representatives. Our use of the video has fully been authorized (as evidenced by four uninterrupted months and 160 million-plus viewings without objection) by both Ms. Black and the copyright holder. Regardless, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to take the high road and work out the complaint as soon as possible, so that the million-plus people who watch Friday for free each day can continue to enjoy the video." [...] On September 16, 2011, the video was restored to YouTube, on Black's official channel.|$|E
