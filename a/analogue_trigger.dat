This triggering platform is planned to replace previous <b>analogue</b> <b>triggering</b> systems that involve time-consuming manual tasks of connecting analogue electronics with NIM components. These manual tasks involve a multitude of wiring connections and their timings are error prone. Multiple on-going experiments could not time-share the expensive NIM electronics, implying lengthy waits between experiments and inefficient resource us- age.

The gamepad features an analogue stick and <b>analogue</b> <b>triggers</b> which was designed specifically for the game, {{in order to make}} movement easier. During development, director Steven Spielberg visited the Sonic Team studio and became the first person outside the development team to play the game. Naka asked him to play with an experimental version of the Saturn 3D controller, and was jokingly referred to as the [...] "Spielberg controller" [...] throughout development. The controller was designed with the game specifically in mind; the development team compared the success of the Nintendo 64 controller with Super Mario 64 (1996), and realised that the default Saturn controller was more suited for arcade games in contrast to the gameplay of Nights into Dreams. The game was marketed with an advertising budget of $10million, which included the use of television and print advertisements in the United States.|$|R

This event is mainly characterized by a massive loss of cortical CD 4 +/CD 8 + double-positive cells, but also by other structural and functional alterations in the organ. A number of molecules, including extracellular ATP, have been suggested {{to play a role in}} the selective processes that take place in the thymus. ATP and <b>analogues</b> <b>trigger</b> many different cellular responses in thymocytes and other cell types, such as the opening of plasma membrane cation channels and a pore that may induce cell death. Herein, we investigated the possible involvement of extracellular ATP in thymus atrophy induced by infection with T. cruzi. We observed that ATP induces an increase in plasma membrane permeabilization and cellular death in CD 4 +/CD 8 + double-positive thymocytes collected from infected mice during the atrophy phase. No differences were observed prior to the atrophy phase or during the chronic phase. Our results indicate that P 2 Z/P 2 X 7 receptors may play a central role in thymus atrophy during T. cruzi infection...|$|R

40|$|Jasmonates are {{phytohormones}} {{involved in}} a wide range of plant processes, including growth, development, senescence, and defense. Jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile, 2), an amino acid conjugate of jasmonic acid (JA, 1), has been identified as a bioactive endogenous jasmonate. However, JA-Ile (2) <b>analogues</b> <b>trigger</b> different responses in the plant. ω-Hydroxylation of the pentenyl side chain leads to the inactive 12 -OH-JA-Ile (3) acting as a “stop” signal. On the other hand, a lactone derivative of 12 -OH-JA (5) (jasmine ketolactone, JKL) occurs in nature, although with no known biological function. Inspired by the chemical structure of JKL (6) and in order to further explore the potential biological activities of 12 -modified JA-Ile derivatives, we synthesized two macrolactones (JA-Ile-lactones (4 a) and (4 b)) derived from 12 -OH-JA-Ile (3). The biological activity of (4 a) and (4 b) was tested for their ability to elicit nicotine production, a well-known jasmonate dependent secondary metabolite. Both macrolactones showed strong biological activity, inducing nicotine accumulation to a similar extent as methyl jasmonate does in Nicotiana attenuata leaves. Surprisingly, the highest nicotine contents were found in plants treated with the JA-Ile-lactone (4 b), which has (3 S, 7 S) configuration at the cyclopentanone not known from natural jasmonates. Macrolactone (4 a) is a valuable standard to explore for its occurrence in nature...|$|R

Exceptionally, these aromatic heterocycles proved to be very stable and thus very handy to form controlled solid-state organizations in which wire-like polymeric structures are formed through secondary N⋅⋅⋅Y bonding interactions (SBIs) engaging the chalcogen (Y=Se or Te) and nitrogen atoms. In particular, {{it has been shown}} that the recognition properties of the chalcogen centre at the solid state could be programmed by selectively barring one of its σ-holes through a combination of electronic and steric effects exerted by the substituent at the 2 -position. As predicted by the electrostatic potential surfaces calculated by quantum chemical modelling, the pyridyl groups revealed to be the stronger chalcogen bonding acceptors, and thus the best ligand candidate for programming the molecular organization at the solid state. In contrast, the thiophenyl group is an unsuitable substituent for establishing SBIs in this molecular system as it gives rise to chalcogen–chalcogen repulsion. The weaker chalcogen donor properties of the Se <b>analogues</b> <b>trigger</b> the formation of feeble N⋅⋅⋅Se contacts, which are manifested in similar solid-state polymers featuring longer nitrogen–chalcogen distances...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to build}} an {{interface}} between a computor and a three phase thyristor bridge rectifier, enabling the computor to control its D. C. output voltage. By writing a suitable computor program, this system was extended to provide closed loop computor control {{of the speed of}} a D. C. machine. The first interface and computor program were so designed that the computer provided the required <b>analogue</b> <b>triggering</b> delay for voltage control of the D. C. output. This setup did not allow for infinite variation of the voltage and occupied {{a large portion of the}} computor time. Thus it was decided to modify the interface, letting it provide its own delay, thus freeing the computor of the delay routine and giving it more time to do other tasks. Control of the bridge rectifier was also improved. When closed loop control was implemented, the system was found to be unstable. It was thus simulated and stabilized on the analogue computor. A new digital computor program was written incorporating those characteristics which were found necessary in the simulation to make the system stable. The modified form of compensation was found to give a satisfactory performance for both step and ramp inputs to the system as well as load transients on the D. C. motor. Various types of tachogenerator were tested to find which was the most suitable for operation with the computer. All the types tested gave satisfactory performances. The major factor affecting performance was the quality of the tachogenerator...|$|R
40|$|The innate {{immune system}} has the {{capacity}} to recognize a wide range of pathogens based on conserved PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns). In the case of bacterial LPS (lipopolysaccharide) recognition, the best studied PAMP, {{it has been shown that}} the {{innate immune system}} employs at least three cell-surface receptors: CD 14, TLR 4 (Toll-like receptor 4) and MD- 2 protein. CD 14 binds LPS from Enterobacteriaceae and then transfers it to MD- 2, leading to TLR 4 aggregation and signal transduction. LPS analogues such as lipid IVa seem to act as LPS antagonists in human cells, but exhibit LPS mimetic activity in mouse cells. Although TLR 4 has been shown to be involved in this species-specific discrimination, the mechanism by which this is achieved has not been elucidated. The questions that remain are how the innate immune system can discriminate between LPS from different bacteria as well as different LPS analogues, and whether or not the structure of LPS affects its interaction with the CD 14 –TLR 4 –MD- 2 cluster. Is it possible that the ‘shape’ of LPS induces the formation of different receptor clusters, and thus a different immune response? In the present study, we demonstrate using biochemical as well as fluorescence-imaging techniques that different LPS <b>analogues</b> <b>trigger</b> the recruitment of different receptors within microdomains. The composition of each receptor cluster as well as the number of TLR 4 molecules that are recruited within the cluster seem to determine whether an immune response will be induced or inhibited...|$|R

Angiogenic endothelial cells {{exposed to the}} vitamin E analogues, unlike their arrested counterparts, readily accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) by interfering with the mitochondrial redox chain and activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The vitamin E analogues inhibited angiogenesis in vitro as assessed using the ''woundhealing'' and ''tube-forming'' models. Endothelial cells deficient in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were resistant to the vitamin E analogues, both in ROS accumulation and apoptosis induction, maintaining their angiogenic potential. A-TOS inhibited angiogenesis in a mouse cancer model, as documented by ultrasound imaging. We conclude that vitamin E analogues selectively kill angiogenic endothelial cells, suppressing tumor growth, which has intriguing clinical implications.

40|$|Most prokaryotic (cytosine- 5) -DNA methyltransferases {{increase}} {{the frequency of}} deamination at the cytosine targeted for methylation in vitro {{in the absence of}} the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) or the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). We show here that, under the same in vitro conditions, the prokaryotic methyltransferase, M. MspI (from Moraxella sp.), causes very few cytosine deaminations, suggesting a mechanism in which M. MspI may avoid enzyme-mediated cytosine deamination. Two analogues of AdoMet, sinefungin and 5 '-amino- 5 '-deoxyadenosine, greatly increased the frequency of cytosine deamination mediated by M. MspI presumably by introducing a proton-donating amino group into the catalytic centre, thus facilitating the formation of an unstable enzyme-dihydrocytosine intermediate and hydrolytic deamination. Interestingly, two naturally occurring analogues, adenosine and 5 '-methylthio- 5 '-deoxyadenosine, which do not contain a proton-donating amino group, also weakly increased the deamination frequency by M. MspI, even in the presence of AdoMet or AdoHcy. These <b>analogues</b> may <b>trigger</b> a conformational change in the enzyme without completely inhibiting the access of solvent water to the catalytic centre, thus allowing hydrolytic deamination of the enzyme-dihydrocytosine intermediate.

40|$|The {{unquestionable}} therapeutic {{success of}} the anticancer drug cis-platin and its second- and third-generation <b>analogues</b> has <b>triggered,</b> during the past fifty years, the development of several metal-based potential chemotherapeutic drugs. Among all, gold complexes of the type [AuX 2 (dtc) ] (X = Cl, Br; dtc = various dithiocarbamates), have been gaining increasing attention due to their capability to strongly inhibit tumor cells growth by exploiting mechanisms of action different from those recognized for the clinically-established platinum drugs. As known, survival of tumor cells is favored by mitochondrial changes that make death induction harder {{in a variety of}} stress conditions. These changes likely involve mitochondria, and include the inhibition of permeability transition pore (PTP) opening through a variety of kinase signaling pathways. Here, we present new biological findings for gold(III) -containing molecules showing a potent anticancer activity coupled with a peculiar selectivity toward cancer cells. The gold(III) -complexes are able to induce oxidative stress and tumor cell death favoring the PTP opening. Therefore, they target a specific hallmark of cancer cells, such as the resistance to apoptosis. These findings pave the way for a novel strategy allowing to hit crucial mechanisms that shield the neoplasms from the toxicity of many anti-tumor strategies, and identify the gold(III) -dithiocarbamates as a promising chemotherapeutic drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Leishmania donovani is the causative {{agent of}} visceral leishmaniasis. The enzyme pteridine reductase 1 (PTR 1) of L. donovani {{acts as a}} metabolic bypass for drugs targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR); therefore, for successful antifolate chemotherapy to be developed against Leishmania, it must target both enzyme activities. Leishmania cells overexpressing PTR 1 tagged at the N-terminal with green fluorescent protein were established to screen for proprietary dihydropyrimidone (DHPM) derivatives of DHFR specificity synthesised in our laboratory. A cell-permeable molecule with impressive antileishmanial in vitro and in vivo oral activity was identified. Structure activity relationship based on homology model drawn on our recombinant enzyme established the highly selective inhibition of the enzyme by this analogue. It was seen that the leishmanicidal effect of this <b>analogue</b> is <b>triggered</b> by programmed cell death mediated {{by the loss of}} plasma membrane integrity as detected by binding of annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential culminating in cell cycle arrest at the sub-G 0 /G 1 phase and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Hence, this DHPM analogue [(4 -fluoro-phenyl) - 6 -methyl- 2 -thioxo- 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydropyrimidine- 5 -carboxylic acid ethyl ester] is a potent antileishmanial agent that merits further pharmacological investigation...|$|R

When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mouse LXA 4 R showed specific binding to [3 H]LXA 4 (K d � 1. 5 nM), and with LXA 4 activated GTP hydrolysis. Mouse LXA 4 R mRNA was most abundant in neutrophils. In addition to LXA 4 and 15 -epi-LXA 4, bioactive LX stable analogues competed with both [3 H]LXA 4 and [3 H]leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4) – specific binding in vitro to neutrophils and endothelial cells, respectively.

40|$|While recent {{evidence}} {{strongly suggests}} that the third complementarity determining regions (CDR 3 s) of T cell receptors (TCRs) directly contact antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the nature of other TCR contact(s) is less clear. Here we probe {{the extent to which}} different antigens can affect this interaction by comparing the responses of T cells bearing structurally related TCRs to cytochrome c peptides and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) presented by 13 mutant antigen-presenting cell (APC) lines. Each APC expresses a class II MHC molecule (I-Ek) with a single substitution of an amino acid residue predicted to be located on the MHC alpha helices and to point "up" towards the TCR. We find that very limited changes (even a single amino acid) in either a CDR 3 loop of the TCR or in a contact residue of the antigenic peptide can {{have a profound effect on}} relatively distant TCR/MHC interactions. The extent of these effects can be as great as that observed between T cells bearing entirely different TCRs and recognizing different peptides. We also find that superantigen presentation entails a distinct mode of TCR/MHC interaction compared with peptide presentation. These data suggest that TCR/MHC contacts can be made in a variety of ways between the same TCR and MHC, with the final configuration apparently dominated by the antigen. These observations suggest a molecular basis for recent reports in which either peptide <b>analogues</b> or superantigens <b>trigger</b> distinct pathways of T cell activation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{starvation}} for nitrogen on a glucose-containing medium causes entrance into G 0 and downregulation of all {{targets of the}} PKA pathway. Re-addition of a nitrogen source {{in the presence of}} glucose causes rapid activation of trehalase and other PKA targets. Trehalase activation upon ammonium re-supplementation is dependent on PKA activity, but not on its regulatory subunit nor is it associated with an increase in cAMP. In nitrogen-starved cells, ammonium transport and activation of trehalase are most active in strains expressing either the Mep 2 or Mep 1 ammonium permease, as opposed to Mep 3. The non-metabolizable ammonium <b>analogue,</b> methylamine, also <b>triggers</b> activation of trehalase when transported by Mep 2 but not when taken up by diffusion. Inhibition of ammonium incorporation into metabolism did not prevent signalling. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis of Mep 2 showed that transport and signalling were generally affected in a similar way, although they could be separated partially by specific mutations. Our results suggest an ammonium permease-based sensing mechanism for rapid activation of the PKA pathway. Mutagenesis of Asn 246 to Ala in Mep 2 abolished transport and signalling with methylamine but had no effect with ammonium. The plant AtAmt 1; 1, AtAmt 1; 2, AtAmt 1; 3 and AtAmt 2 ammonium transporters sustained transport and trehalase activation to different extents. Specific mutations in Mep 2 affected the activation of trehalase differently from induction of pseudohyphal differentiation. We also show that Mep permease involvement in PKA control is different from their role in haploid invasive growth, in which Mep 1 sustains and Mep 2 inhibits, in a way independent of the ammonium level in the medium. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Yeast cells {{starved for}} {{inorganic}} phosphate on a glucose-containing medium arrest growth {{and enter the}} resting phase G 0. We show that re-addition of phosphate rapidly affects well known protein kinase A targets: trehalase activation, trehalose mobilization, loss of heat resistance, repression of STRE-controlled genes and induction of ribosomal protein genes. Phosphate-induced activation of trehalase is independent of protein synthesis and {{of an increase in}} ATP. It is dependent on the presence of glucose, which can be detected independently by the G-protein coupled receptor Gpr 1 and by the glucose-phosphorylation dependent system. Addition of phosphate does not trigger a cAMP signal. Despite this, lowering of protein kinase A activity by mutations in the TPK genes strongly reduces trehalase activation. Inactivation of phosphate transport by deletion of PHO 84 abolishes phosphate signalling at standard concentrations, arguing against the existence of a transport-independent receptor. The non-metabolizable phosphate <b>analogue</b> arsenate also <b>triggered</b> signalling. Constitutive expression of the Pho 84, Pho 87, Pho 89, Pho 90 and Pho 91 phosphate carriers indicated pronounced differences in their transport and signalling capacities in phosphate-starved cells. Pho 90 and Pho 91 sustained highest phosphate transport but did not sustain trehalase activation. Pho 84 sustained both transport and rapid signalling, whereas Pho 87 was poor in transport but positive for signalling. Pho 89 displayed very low phosphate transport and was negative for signalling. Although the results confirmed that rapid signalling is independent of growth recovery, long-term mobilization of trehalose was much better correlated with growth recovery than with trehalase activation. These results demonstrate that phosphate acts as a nutrient signal for activation of the protein kinase A pathway in yeast in a glucose-dependent way and they indicate that the Pho 84 and Pho 87 carriers act as specific phosphate sensors for rapid phosphate signalling. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe Mw 8. 8 Maule {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} of central Chile on 2010 February 27 and was the sixth largest earthquake to be recorded instrumentally. This subduction zone event was followed by thousands of aftershocks both near the plate interface and in the overriding continental crust. Here, we report on a pair of large shallow crustal earthquakes that occurred on 2010 March 11 within 15 min of each other near the town of Pichilemu, on the coast of the O’Higgins Region of Chile. Field and aerial reconnaissance following the events revealed no distinct surface rupture. We infer from geodetic data spanning both events that the ruptures occurred on synthetic SW-dipping normal faults. The first, larger rupture was followed by buried slip on a steeper fault in the hangingwall. The fault locations and geometry of the two events are additionally constrained by locations of aftershock seismicity based on the International Maule Aftershock Data Set. The maximum slip on the main fault is about 3 m and, consistent with field results, the onshore slip is close to zero near the surface. Satellite radar data also reveal that significant aseismic afterslip occurred following the two earthquakes. Coulomb stress modelling indicates that the faults were positively stressed by up to 40 bars as a result of slip on the subduction interface in the preceding megathrust event; in other words, the Pichilemu earthquakes should be considered aftershocks of the Maule earthquake. The occurrence of these extensional events suggests that regional interseismic compressive stresses are small.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the role of the affinity of peptide:MHC/TCR interaction in the regulation of T cell activation, death and repertoire selection. Three aspects pertinent for our understanding of this issue have been analyzed. First, we analyzed the effect of partially agonistic peptides on the activation and survival of CTL clones specific for a highly immunogenic HLA A 11 -restricted peptide epitope derived from the EBV nuclear Ag 4 (EBNA 4), IVTDFSVIK (designated IVT). Several analogues with substitutions of TCR contact residues were able to trigger cytotoxic activity without induction of IL- 2 mRNA and protein or T cell proliferation. Triggering with these partial agonists in the absence of exogenous IL- 2 resulted in down-regulation of the cytotoxic potential of the specific CTLs. One <b>analogue</b> selectively <b>triggered</b> apoptosis as efficiently as the original epitope, subdividing the partial agonists into apoptosis-inducing and non-inducing ligands. Analysis of early T cell activation events did not reveal significant differences between the two types of analogue peptides. These results demonstrate that some partial agonists can dissociate the induction of CTL death from CTL activation. Then, we characterized the apoptotic programs induced by the immunogenic peptide and its partially agonistic analogues in the IVT-specific CTL clones. Our major finding is that CTL triggering with partially agonistic peptide ligands can initiate death receptor dependent and independent apoptotic programs in the effector cells. In contrast to classical AICD, death receptors are not essential for the elimination of CTLs activated with partially agonistic peptides. In addition, death receptor independent apoptosis requires caspases other than caspase 3 and 8. Induction of anti-apoptotic BCl- 2 and BCl-XL expression is associated with resistance to this form of apoptosis. Also, IL- 2 enhances classical and inhibits death receptor independent AICD. We concluded that TCR triggering not accompanied by IL- 2 production may result in elimination of T-lymphocytes in death receptor independent manner. Our data demonstrated that engagement of TCR by MHC-peptide complexes can trigger diverse apoptotic programs of AICD and that the choice between these programs is determined by the agonistic potency of MHC- peptide ligand. Second, the molecular basis of different outcomes of CTLs stimulation with. immunogenic and partially agoistic peptide ligands was analyzed. The role of MHC:peptide/TCR affinity in the regulation of T cell activation was characterized using tetramer technology. Our results demonstrated that the All complexes assembled with the partial agonist dissociated from the surface of IVT-specific CTLs with a faster kinetics as compared with complexes containing the immunogenic peptide. We also showed that the efficiency of CTL recognition correlates with the stability of interaction between the specific TCR and MHC:peptide complex. Tetramer binding and secretion of INFgamma were shown to be compatible with T-cell activation by partially agonistic peptides. In conclusion, our results indicate that the affinity of TCR/MHC:peptide interaction determines the strength of TCR signalling, extent of CTL activation as well as the apoptosis pathway that operates in CTLs in the course of AICD. The third aim of our study was to investigate the influence of the affinity of TCR/MHC interaction on the selection and maintenance of TCR repertoire of peptide specific CTLs. Using tetramer technology, we investigated the restriction of TCR usage among CTL responses against a subdominat EBNA 4 derived peptide referred to as AWF. In agreement with the earlier findings, ex vivo analysis of AVF-specific CTLs using AVF-containing HLA All tetramers revealed the same degree of conservation of the AVF-specific response both in healthy virus carriers and in the course of primary EBV infection. Tetramer binding and dissociation experiments performed with AVF-specific: CTLs or CTLs expressing a very diverse set of TCRs and specific to another immunodominant A 11 -restricted EBVderived peptide epitope did not support a model of affinity driven selection of restricted TCR repertoires. Characterization of individuals that fail to mount responses to the immunodominant All -restricted CTL epitope but efficiently respond to the AVF-peptide argued against interclonal competition as the reason for the observed TCR conservation. Collectively, our data confirm the existence of naturally induced peptide-specific CTL responses with highly restricted TCR usage. Our data do not support a major role for affinity of MHC:TCR interaction in the selection of structurally conserved TCR-repertoires and suggest that such conservations may be due to structural constrains in MHC:peptide/TCR interactions or endogenous pre-selection of certain clonotypes...|$|R
40|$|SamPic 0 is a Waveform and Time to Digital Converter (WTDC) {{multichannel}} chip providing outstanding {{time measurement}} capabilities. It {{makes use of}} the new AMS 0. 18 -m CMOS technology. One of its specificities stands in its capacity to directly measure the arrival time of fast analog signals without the need of any external discriminator. Each of its 16 channels associates a traditional DLL-based TDC providing a raw time based on a counter and a DLL with an ultra-fast 64 -cell deep analogue memory (bandwidth > 1. 5 GHz, sampling frequency > 10 GS/s) allowing fine timing extraction {{as well as other}} parameters of the pulse like charge, pulse width or rise-time. Each channel also integrates a discriminator that can self-trigger the channel independently or allow it to participate to a more complex trigger embedded on-chip. External trigger is also available. After <b>triggering,</b> <b>analogue</b> data is also digitized on-chip by a massively parallel low-power 11 -bit ADC Wilkinson ADC running at 1. 3 GHz and only data corresponding to a predetermined region of interest is then serially transferred towards the acquisition system. Dead-time is thus limited to 1. 6 s for an 11 -bit conversion and is as low as 400 ns for a 9 -bit conversion which already provides an excellent time precision. Contrasting with the existing fast sampler chips usually designed for all-purpose applications and requiring external electronics to be used for performing accurate timing measurements, the SAMPIC 0 chip presented here has been specifically designed for this type of application. Although the SAMPIC 0 chip was originally thought as a technological demonstrator, its readout has been structured from the start for low dead-time applications and its design thus permits an easy integration in medium size acquisition systems. Such a set of boards and DAQ system has already been developed with the primary goal of evaluating the chip performances, but it is also usable to take data with detectors in a real environment. This setup, including a powerful software with an original interactive graphical interface, has permitted the characterization of the SAMPIC 0 chip, and the measurements of its time resolution which is as good as 14 ps rms without any correction. This value is decreased in the range of 3 to 4 ps rms after a simple correction, itself based on a very simple calibration. This calibration remains very stable with time and can thus be stored on-board. The talk will present the new WTDC concept, the chip architecture, the existing set of boards and DAQ system and will give report of the latest measurements of the chip performances. It will also present the modifications and additions to the design of the second version of the chip, which should be submitted {{in the first half of}} 2014. In addition to a few corrections, these modifications mainly target the analog and noise performances, the improvement of the trigger logics and the reduction of the dead-time...|$|R
40|$|One type of photon {{detector}} is the {{photomultiplier tube}} (or PMT), {{most commonly used}} in Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). A PMT has a photoelectric cathode that absorbs light and emits an electron. A PMT also contains other electrodes in sequence called dynodes. Each dynode is kept at a higher voltage than the preceding one. Electrons are attracted to each successive dynode, and upon striking the dynode they knock off several additional electrons from the dynode. As the electron stream travels from dynode to dynode, more and more electrons are emitted as a cascade. The pulses generated by the photo sensors (typically PMTs), need to be sampled very fast {{in order to determine}} with high precision its arrival time. A typical 2. 5 ns width pulse from a PMT needs to be sampled at 800 MHz according to Nyquist theorem, being 1 Gs/s a typical sampling frequency. Considering that an IACT camera can have around 1000 pixels and 8 quantization levels, a continuous recording of the signals from all the pixels in a camera would mean a data rate of 1 TB/s, which is unmanageable. Instead of that, IACTs only records continuously when an interesting event is detected. In order to do that, they uses a data acquisition system based on analogue memories with a complex <b>trigger</b> system. This <b>analogue</b> memories sample the input signals at high sample rate, but with small buffers mounted on a dedicated ring configuration. The NECTAr's (New Electronics for the Cherenkov Telescope Array) front end (FE) option for the camera of the CTA (which is this thesis focused) is a 16 bits and 1 — 3 GS/s sampling chip based on <b>analogue</b> memories. The <b>trigger</b> system, analyzes each pulse, and decides if the signal corresponds to a valid Cherenkov event to be stored or not. According to the CTA consortium requirements, the camera specification needs dedicated electronic circuits out of the specifications of the commercial components in the market. Due to cost effective and state of the art innovation, some full custom ASICs have been developed. The aim of this thesis is to develop a full amplification channel path to inject the fast pulses coming from the camera sensors to the analogue memories of the digitizer circuitry. Based on the hard constrains of the amplification channel path for the CTA project, new technologies are applied to cover on one hand, the required wideband at the low noise level and, on the other hand decrease the power consumption required as much as possible. A first amplification stage is based on a wideband current mode preamplifier with 16 bits DR. We propose a novel current mode circuit to overcome the maximum signal limitation by creating multiple gain paths at the very front end of the input stage. The input current is split in the common base input stage into two output scaled currents. Finally, the current signal is converted to voltage by a closed loop transimpedance amplifier. A fully closed loop solution based on voltage feedback amplifiers (OTA or OpAmp) is not feasible because a Gain-bandwidth (GBW) product of more than 8 GHz is required, and the maximum GBW product that can be achieved in a 0. 35 [tm CMOS technology is well below 1 GHz. An alternative approach based on linearized high frequency (HF) transconductors is explored for a second amplification stage, which includes dedicated circuitry to adjust the DC offset in order to be properly DC coupled to the NECTArO ADC, and is followed by a high swing current to voltage conversion, and finally a low output impedance closed loop buffer is used to drive a capacitive load. Aquesta tesi està centrada en un nou disseny de circuits per a la senyal d'entrada d'una càmera per a un telescopi Cherenkov on l'amplificació es divideix en dos etapes de guany per tal de aconseguir els requeriments del projecte. La primera etapa presenta un innovador disseny d'un preamplificador de baix soroll i gran ample de banda (BW) mentre que la segona etapa d'amplificació presenta un nou desenvolupament d'un circuït de guany, sent impossible d'aconseguir mitjançant els esquemes clàssics en a la tecnologia requerida. Aquesta segona etapa també adapta el senyal per a les posteriors parts electròniques del sistema de lectura de les càmeres dels telescopis Cherenkov. La primera etapa pre-amplificadora aconsegueix els requeriments mitjançant un innovador disseny que compleix totes les restriccions amb un baix consum. La solució escollida està basada en un nou circuit en mode corrent, creant múltiples camins de guany en les primeres parts de l'etapa d'entrada de la electrònica de lectura, d'aquesta manera podem aconseguir simultàniament prestacions de gran rang dinàmic, baix soroll, baixa impedància d'entrada, baix voltatge i baix consum. La etapa pre-amplificadora també incorpora un amplificador de transimpedància de llaç tancat amb una innovadora etapa de sortida de tipus AB dissenyada amb tecnologia SiGe 0. 35 grn, permetent al disseny atacar línies de transmissió (típicament de 50 C) de càrrega) i mantenint el gran BW amb un moderat consum de potència. Aquesta tesi presenta un mètode alternatiu per a implementar amplificadors de polsos completament diferencials, aconseguint el guany desitjat i preservant a la vegada el gran BW. La linealitat en polsos ràpids es troba al nivell de solucions basades en OTA retro-alimentats limitats per la tassa de canvi (SR) i altres qüestions transitòries. Un amplificador en tecnologia CMOS de 0. 35 grn implementa i valida el producte de guany-amplada de banda de 8 GHz oferint al mateix temps un gran marge d'ajust. Aquest disseny també incorpora un amplificador de transimpedància de llaç tancat amb una innovadora etapa de sortida de tipus AB basada en el disseny de la primera etapa amplificadora, però dissenyada en tecnologia CMOS de 0. 35 grn, la qual resulta molt mes difícil d'aconseguir...|$|R
