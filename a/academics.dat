5|$|Many <b>academics,</b> {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal <b>academics</b> in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns.

40|$|Critical {{questions}} in educational psychology research {{to be addressed}} in this paper concern the casual relationship between <b>academic</b> self-concept, <b>academic</b> motivation and its effect on <b>academic</b> achievement. Do changes in <b>academic</b> self-concept and <b>academic</b> motivation lead to changes in subsequent <b>academic</b> achievement? Various studies have attempted to answer this question by examining the causal relations between <b>academic</b> self-concept and <b>academic</b> achievement as well as <b>academic</b> motivation and <b>academic</b> achievement. Less integral to research however has been the investigation of the relationship between both <b>academic</b> self-concept and <b>academic</b> motivation and their combined effects on <b>academic</b> achievement. For this reason, this paper aims to elucidate further the relationships among self-concept, motivation and <b>academic</b> achievement by proposing a longitudinal design by which self-concept and motivation are measured from a multidimensional perspective. The theoretical and practical implications of this important question will be discussed. Self-concept, <b>academic</b> motivation, causal ordering, <b>academic</b> achievemen...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} among <b>academic</b> self-efficacy, socially-prescribed perfectionism, and <b>academic</b> burnout in medical school students and to determine whether <b>academic</b> self-efficacy had a mediating role in the relationship between perfectionism and <b>academic</b> burnout. Methods: A total of 244 first-year and second-year premed medical students and first- to fourth-year medical students were enrolled in this study. As study tools, socially-prescribed perfectionism, <b>academic</b> self-efficacy, and <b>academic</b> burnout scales were utilized. For data analysis, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. Results: <b>Academic</b> burnout had correlation with socially-prescribed perfectionism. It had negative correlation with <b>academic</b> self-efficacy. Socially-prescribed perfectionism and <b>academic</b> self-efficacy had 54 % explanatory power for <b>academic</b> burnout. When socially-prescribed perfectionism and <b>academic</b> self-efficacy were simultaneously used as input, <b>academic</b> self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between socially-prescribed perfectionism and <b>academic</b> burnout. Conclusion: Socially-prescribed perfectionism had a negative effect on <b>academic</b> self-efficacy, ultimately triggering <b>academic</b> burnout. This suggests that it is important to have educational and counseling interventions to improve <b>academic</b> self-efficacy by relieving <b>academic</b> burnout of medical school students...|$|R
40|$|An under-reported {{aspect of}} student {{confidence}} {{is the relationship}} between past <b>academic</b> experiences and levels of <b>Academic</b> Confidence. It was theorised that levels of <b>Academic</b> Confidence might be influenced by an element conceptualised as <b>Academic</b> Sustenance. Using the Sander and Sander’s <b>Academic</b> Behavioural Confidence (ABC) scale, a sample of Australian undergraduate first year university students were surveyed to determine an Overall <b>Academic</b> Confidence (OAC) score. Students with High OAC rankings reported academically sustaining experiences, which assisted in the development of <b>Academic</b> Sustenance, building their <b>Academic</b> Confidence and allowing them to deal with <b>academic</b> challenges more readily. Students who had limited academically sustaining experiences had lower levels of Overall <b>Academic</b> Confidence, which gave them a less optimistic view of their <b>academic</b> abilities. <b>Academic</b> Sustenance consists of four aspects: Encouragement, Drive, Grounding and Efficacy (EDGE). These appear to be non-hierarchical although the aspect of Encouragement was found to exert more developmental opportunities for building <b>Academic</b> Confidence through the influence of <b>Academic</b> Sustenance. Targeted support structures offered through university programs could offer progressive assistance for building <b>Academic</b> Confidence and cultivating <b>Academic</b> Sustenance, which could help more students to cultivate positivity and a more optimistic perception of their <b>academic</b> abilities. ...|$|R

50|$|In many universities, an <b>academic</b> {{concentration}} is a focus {{within a specific}} <b>academic</b> major, that is a field of study within a specific <b>academic</b> major.

At several art schools and liberal arts colleges, an <b>academic</b> concentration serves a similar function to an <b>academic</b> minor at other universities, that is an <b>academic</b> discipline outside of the student's <b>academic</b> major in {{which he or she}} takes a small number of classes.

40|$|This {{study used}} the Rasch model {{to assess the}} unidimensionality and item-person fit of an <b>Academic</b> Self-Concept Questionnaire (ASCQ) {{that is based on}} the Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) perspective. Knowledge of the {{relationship}} between <b>academic</b> achievement and <b>academic</b> self-concept is particularly useful because <b>academic</b> achievement is overemphasized in the CHC. ASCQ largely satisfies the Rasch model for unidimensionality. However, four items had poor Infit statistics, suggesting that they do not contribute significantly to the scale hierarchy. Rasch model also confirmed the unidimensionality of the two subscales – <b>Academic</b> Confidence and <b>Academic</b> Effort. The <b>academic</b> self-concept scale, <b>academic</b> effort and <b>academic</b> confidence subscales were also been found to be valid with students with learning disabilities.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} whether <b>academic</b> burnout/engagement mediated the relationship between <b>academic</b> obstacles/facilitators and <b>academic</b> performance within a South African university context. Participants received a web link to an online survey host in which a questionnaire was presented. The questionnaire included a selfdeveloped demographic questionnaire, an adapted version of the Student Stress Scale (Da Coste Leite & Israel, 2011), an adapted version of the Factors of <b>Academic</b> Facilitators Scale (Salanova, Schaufeli, Martinez, & Breso, 2010), the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Scale (Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, & Bakker, 2002) and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student (Schaufeli, Salanova, et al., 2002). The final sample (n= 351) consisted of both full-time and part-time first year psychology students. The results {{of the current study}} demonstrated that <b>academic</b> obstacles were positively related to <b>academic</b> burnout while <b>academic</b> burnout was negatively related to <b>academic</b> performance. <b>Academic</b> facilitators were also negatively related to <b>academic</b> burnout and positively related to <b>academic</b> engagement. <b>Academic</b> burnout was also found to mediate the relationship between <b>academic</b> obstacles/facilitators and <b>academic</b> performance. The results of the study also demonstrated some non-hypothesised, but not unexpected, findings. <b>Academic</b> burnout, for one, was found to be negatively related to <b>academic</b> engagement. In addition, the indirect effect between <b>academic</b> obstacles and engagement was negative while the indirect effect between <b>academic</b> facilitators and engagement was positive. The results of the current study further demonstrated a novel finding whereby <b>academic</b> performance was positively related to burnout. Furthermore, the indirect effect between <b>academic</b> burnout and engagement was positive while the indirect effects between <b>academic</b> burnout and burnout, <b>academic</b> performance and engagement, and <b>academic</b> performance and performance, were negative. These findings were supported by previous research within both the work and student context. The results of the current study demonstrated, however, that <b>academic</b> engagement was not significantly related to <b>academic</b> performance and therefore was not a mediator in the relationship between <b>academic</b> obstacles/facilitators and <b>academic</b> performance. These results were unexpected given the literature available, however, may have been due {{to the way in which}} <b>academic</b> performance was operationalised within the current study.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Academic</b> {{procrastination}} {{refers to}} the tendency to procrastinate <b>academic</b> tasks, and the concomitant negative emotions. Based on questionnaire surveys of 305 postgraduate students, the study investigated the relationship between <b>academic</b> procrastination and three psychodynamic variables- achievement motivation, goal orientation and <b>academic</b> self-efficacy through path analyses. Main results included: (1) <b>Academic</b> procrastination is a common phenomenon among the postgraduates, nearly 60 % of them having the procrastination tendency, while {{almost all of them}} having the desire to reduce procrastination. The female postgraduates showed a higher level of <b>academic</b> procrastination than the male postgraduates. (2) <b>Academic</b> procrastination level is correlated with different dimensions of the three psychodynamic variables. (3) The psychodynamic variables contribute to <b>academic</b> procrastination level by three ways. First, achievement motivation, goal orientation, and <b>academic</b> self-efficacy directly contribute to <b>academic</b> procrastination negatively. Second, goal orientation and <b>academic</b> self-efficacy contribute to <b>academic</b> procrastination through achievement motivation. Third, goal orientation contributes to achievement motivation through <b>academic</b> self-efficacy, which then contributes to <b>academic</b> procrastination. Achievement motivation may act as a mediating factor. Implications for educators were discussed based on these findings.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} validating the <b>academic</b> {{self-concept}} scale by Liu and Wang (2005) in measuring <b>academic</b> self-concept among university students. Structural equation modelling {{was used to}} validate the scale which was composed of two subscales; <b>academic</b> confidence and <b>academic</b> effort. The study was conducted on university students; males and females from different levels of study and faculties. In this study the influence of <b>academic</b> self-concept on <b>academic</b> achievement was assessed, tested whether the hypothesised model fitted the data, analysed the invariance of the path coefficients among the moderating variables, and also, highlighted whether <b>academic</b> confidence and <b>academic</b> effort measured <b>academic</b> selfconcept. The results from the model revealed that <b>academic</b> self-concept influenced <b>academic</b> achievement and the hypothesised model fitted the data. The results also supported the model as the causal structure was not sensitive to gender, levels of study, and faculties of students; hence, applicable to all the groups taken as moderating variables. It was also noted that <b>academic</b> confidence and <b>academic</b> effort are a measure of <b>academic</b> self-concept.
