40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} of Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) to visual and olfactory cues were assessed in a cylindrical black box and a Y-tube olfactometer. Frankliniella occidentalis preferred circular shapes to other five geometrical patterns (rectangle, triangle, inverted triangle, diamond, and modified circle imitating flower petals) in multiple choice tests. In pair wise choice tests, the thrips preferred the yellow <b>artificial</b> <b>flower</b> shape to the geometrical patterns tested.

Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again, and they intended to amputate one of his legs. Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.|$|E
