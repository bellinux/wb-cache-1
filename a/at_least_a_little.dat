5|$|The superb fairy-wren can {{be found}} in almost any area that has <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dense {{undergrowth}} for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. The superb fairy-wren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plague of London {{struck in}} the summer of 1665, and the Theatre Royal, along with all other public entertainment, was shut down by order of the Crown on 5 June. It {{remained}} closed for 18 months until the autumn of 1666, during which time it received <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> interior renovation, including widening of the stage. Located well {{to the west of the}} City boundary, the theatre was unaffected by the Great Fire of London, which raged through the City in September 1666, but it burned down six years later on 25 January 1672.|$|E
25|$|Lopez {{does not}} like to repeat the models so she never uses the same design without {{changing}} it <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit in two collection in a row. That productivity {{requires a lot of}} time. Lopez says that she and her designers team could often stay in the studio for days choosing the colors and materials that match.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} Anglicisation {{of the upper}} classes in general has {{happened}} before the Anglicisation of the peasantry in other areas which have given up speaking Celtic languages it is not implausible that the peasantry continued to speak Cumbric for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while after. Around 1200 there {{is a list of}} the names of men living in the area of Peebles. Amongst them are Cumbric names such as Gospatrick: servant or follower of Saint Patrick, Gosmungo: servant of Saint Mungo, Guososwald: servant of Oswald of Northumbria and Goscubrycht: servant of Cuthbert. Two of the saints– Oswald and Cuthbert— are from Northumbria showing influence on Cumbric not found in Welsh.|$|E
500|$|Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a {{relatively}} positive review. He wrote, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' was Duchovny's nudge-nudge, wink-wink writing-directing effort for this season. [...] Duchovny did not fail to deliver an episode that truly reflected his own wit and intelligence. All the while remaining true {{to the spirit of}} the show that made him famous." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that it [...] "is muddled and frequently so in love with just being weird for weird’s sake that everybody forgets we need <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> justification to pull everything together in the end." [...] He also called it [...] "a hard episode not to love, frankly." [...] Handlen felt that the humor and sweetness helped to make the episode a success. He also wrote that Mulder and Scully's dynamic worked towards the episode's favor.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, when {{speculation}} arose that a male star {{would be}} exiting the soap opera, Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote {{that it could}} be Tucker, saying: [...] "Who despite being played by one of daytime’s most popular [...] has never really gelled with the audience. His recent one night stand with Harmony leaves him hated by pretty much everyone in Genoa City." [...] Of the possible pairing between Tucker and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), Luke Kerr (also of Zap2it) wrote: [...] "Billionaire Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols) is the latest white knight to ride in and save Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) from herself on The Young and the Restless. Granted, Genoa City's answer to Sir Richard Branson has ulterior motives, but there's no denying the two share <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> chemistry." [...] During a storyline in which Tucker attempted to take over Newman Enterprises, Jamey Giddens (also of Zap2it) wrote, [...] "You know, I'm starting to dig ol' Tucker." [...] When Nichols was let go from the soap opera, Giddens wrote, [...] "Daytime television's answer to Richard Branson is no more." [...] Bibel wrote: [...] "The billionaire {{who turned out to be}} Katherine’s long lost son and Devon’s father suffered from inconsistent writing throughout his three year tenure on the show." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you get it}} yourself?" [...] Muriel {{asked of}} her Shadow, rather {{relieved}} than otherwise that Mali hadn't left her. It was something in these dire straits to have somebody always near who could <b>at</b> <b>least</b> speak <b>a</b> <b>little</b> English.|$|R
5000|$|For children, fun is {{strongly}} related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way.

2500|$|On March 27, 2008, the Pew Research Center {{called the}} speech [...] "arguably the biggest {{political}} {{event of the}} campaign so far", noting that 85 percent of Americans said they had heard <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about the speech and that 54 percent said they {{heard a lot about}} it. [...] Eventually, The New Yorker opined that the speech helped elect Obama as the President of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The Pew Research Center {{conducted}} a poll that asked about Americans' response to Obama's speech in Tucson. The report said that [...] "the {{aftermath of the}} deadly shooting rampage in Tucson, Ariz., dominated the public's news interest last week as President Obama's speech at a memorial service won praise -- across party lines -- among those who had read or heard about the event." [...] According to Pew, [...] "Most Americans say they heard <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about Obama's speech at the January 12 memorial service at the University of Arizona (75%). Among that group, nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say the address was either excellent (36%) or good (33%), while 21% rate the speech as only fair (15%) or poor (6%)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The milieu is {{identified}} by the author as science fantasy. As L'Engle explains in her book The Rock That Is Higher: Story as Truth: [...] "If we limit ourselves to the possible and provable... we render ourselves incapable of change and growth, {{and that is something}} that should never end. If we limit ourselves to the age that we are, and forget all the ages that we have been, we diminish our truth." [...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of what we are all about." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Faking It", it is {{revealed}} that Gibbs speaks fluent Russian, and he <b>at</b> <b>least</b> speaks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Japanese and Chinese ("Call of Silence" [...] and [...] "My Other Left Foot", respectively). He also signs American Sign Language, which appears in many episodes {{in conversations with}} forensic scientist Abby Sciuto.|$|R

2500|$|According to Katherine St Asaph of PopDust, {{the song}} was {{probably}} the closest to his and Colbie Caillat's collaboration [...] "Lucky." [...] She added that it was [...] "a gentle acoustic ballad {{with a hint of}} speak-singing a ways in but otherwise straightforward and straight-faced [...] soft-rocks its way through sentiments like [...] "when I look into your eyes, it's like watching the night sky or a beautiful sunrise–there's just so much they hold"–still earnest, but joke-free." [...] Amy Dawson of Metro UK called it [...] "a delicate, countrified guitar ballad that drives into a power-chorus singalong conclusion." [...] Colin McGuire of PopMatters was mixed in his review, writing that [...] "'I Won't Give Up', for instance, is acoustic guitar-laden folky pop that falls <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit flat with its predictably bland approach. While the song's hook proves itself memorable enough, the track never graduates into anything other than the ballad-like tediousness the singer has a tendency to revert into." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{has gone}} on record saying [...] "I {{like the idea of}} {{preserving}} <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shred of mystery and making the band to be more an entity—without hopefully sounding too pretentious – as a work of art [...] ". [...] Turner has also {{said in an interview in}} New Zealand music magazine Rip It Up that [...] "we don't want to hand-feed everything to the listener. We just want to have a sense of mystery". There is a definite attitude that art and music are interchangeable and synonymous to the band; he feels that [...] "the songwriting and the artwork come from the same place". This logic relates to visual and aural aspects as well as overt intellectualisation, through literary references and driving philosophies. Books such as Don Quixote, House of Leaves, Labyrinths and the philosophies of Jeremy Bentham have all played a role in shaping the themes of Isis' releases.|$|E
2500|$|He said Norton's {{experience}} as a theatre actor combined with his self-confidence meant that [...] "in a way {{there was some kind}} of mental reality to Edward", but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries. Norton heard about Iñárritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, [...] "I laughed so hard I woke people up." [...] Norton wanted to meet Iñárritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the [...] "embodiment" [...] of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone [...] "who has <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world." [...] Iñárritu agreed.|$|E
5000|$|You {{can get a}} {{very quick}} glimpse of Bryant during the closing credits of the 2000 movie [...] "Longshot". Bryant played a stock {{reporter}} in footage that never made the final cut of the movie. To show their gratitude, the directors <b>at</b> <b>least</b> got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of what took Bryant over 4 hours to tape into {{the end of the}} flick.|$|R
6000|$|Badgery {{held up a}} white hand. [...] "No more, no more. I find {{literature}} quite depressing enough. I {{insist that}} life <b>at</b> <b>least</b> shall be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gayer. Did you tell him I wanted him to paint my room?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Amsterdam" [...] {{was written}} about {{the capital city of}} Eddie and Alex Van Halen's country of birth; their actual birthplace being the town of Nijmegen, further to the east. Eddie is on record in Guitar World as saying, [...] "I always hated the words to 'Wham, Bam Amsterdam', from Balance, because they were all about smoking pot. They were just stupid. Lyrics should plant some sort of seed for thought, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more metamorphical." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} also {{shares her}} given name with Fey, whose full name is Elizabeth Stamatina Fey. However, Liz Lemon is only very rarely {{referred to as}} [...] "Elizabeth" [...] and the character's name is usually given as [...] "Liz Lemon" [...] in official contexts (example, the plaque {{on the door to}} her office). It is also worth noting that in Fey's original script for 30 Rock, Lemon's first name was [...] "Lisa". The character's middle name, [...] "Miervaldis," [...] is a Latvian masculine name. Fey has said that, while Lemon's ethnic background is unknown, [...] "Latvian seems to make sense.". She has also, more recently, been suggested to have German ancestry, and speaks <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of the language. The character's last name, [...] "Lemon," [...] is apparently intended to imply an acerbic personality and possibly also to make her full name alliterative. Fey has stated that she wanted Liz to have a good last name since she knew the character would often be called by it.|$|E
2500|$|During January 2011 Hayman {{recorded}} and released a song {{every day of}} the month, as well as keeping a video diary each day, making them available free of charge. The songs featured different collaborators on different days, including Elizabeth Morris from Allo Darlin', The Wave Pictures, Jack Hayter and Ballboy. Hayman states about the project: [...] "I get tired of having to wait to release songs and records. I thought this would be a way to solve the release bottleneck. I thought it would be funny and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> interesting". Following the January project, Hayman curated the Vostok 5 exhibition at the Outside world Gallery in London which ran from 1 to the 7 September 2011. The exhibition was [...] "for people who love rockets and animals" [...] according to Hayman and featured songs and paintings by Hayman, Paul Rains (Allo Darlin'), Duncan Barrett (Tigercats), Robert Rotifer (Rotifer) and Sarah Lippet (Fever Dream) about animals and humans that have travelled to space, including soviet space dogs, Alexei Leonov, Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev. Hayman then released The Green and the Grey (2011), an album featuring additional tracks from the Essex Arms sessions and produced the album Beer in the Breakers (2011) for The Wave Pictures.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} one star out of four, writing, [...] "I knew going in what the movie was about (few films have such blunt premises) and I knew Two-Minute Warning was {{supposed}} to be a thriller, not a social statement. But I thought perhaps the movie would <b>at</b> <b>least</b> include <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pop sociology to soften its blood-letting. Not a chance. It's a cheerfully unashamed exploitation of two of our great national preoccupations, pro football and guns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do that, of course," [...] Laverick answered, [...] "but I {{wish you}} would let me <b>at</b> <b>least</b> pay over <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of what I {{consider}} due to you. I will take the responsibility for it. It will come from him and not from me." ...|$|R

[...] "The {{gingerbread}} figures are all gone, {{and so are}} those Dutch wooden milkmaids, and most of our other playthings. There has been constant inquiry for cheap raisins, and a great cry for whistles, and trumpets, and jew's-harps; and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> dozen <b>little</b> boys have asked for molasses-candy. And we must contrive to get a peck of russet apples, {{late in the season}} as it is. But, dear cousin, what an enormous heap of copper! Positively a copper mountain!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Children," [...] he said, [...] "no! I {{have never}} heard of there being any such things for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> century.

40|$|Does the {{president}} {{have the ability to}} set the congressional agenda? Agenda setting is a prerequisite for influence, so this is an important element in understanding presidential–legislative relations. We focus on the State of the Union address and show that popular presidents can, indeed, cause Congress to shift attention to those topics most emphasized. The impact is tempered by divided government and time, however. No matter the state of divided government, however, popular presidents can direct congressional attention, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while. Unpopular presidents, by contrast, are irrelevant...|$|R
