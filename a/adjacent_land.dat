5|$|A marina {{was started}} in 1979 by {{dredging}} the upper harbour and laying pontoons. Light industry and car parks occupy the <b>adjacent</b> <b>land.</b> More pontoons were completed in 1991 and 1995. The Whitby Marina Facilities Centre was opened in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, forty {{prefabricated}} {{houses were}} built on <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> on a former holiday camp to rehouse residents {{of some of}} the most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, only five of the older properties were demolished. The original development along Brooklands has faced demolition, particularly with respect to dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be attractive for development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1891, {{a general}} meeting {{took place at}} Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. Everton's {{chairman}} John Houlding proposed that a limited company be formed and that the company should purchase his land and local brewer Joseph Orrel's <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> for a combined £9,237. A club run as a limited company was unusual for the time as football clubs were usually run as “sports clubs” with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by William Barclay, the club secretary and {{a close friend of}} Houlding.|$|E

5|$|On July 15, 1961, to {{meet the}} burgeoning {{educational}} demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing {{the establishment of a}} new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860acres (23.7km²) of <b>adjacent</b> <b>land.</b> A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse {{in the early days of}} World War II.|$|E
5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E
5|$|No longer {{known by}} the BGCR name, the route meanders north, slowly edging east towards Reesor Road and now {{surrounded}} by undeveloped greenspace. It encounters Highway7, north of which it becomes a divided roadway travelling on {{the eastern edge of}} Cornell as well as parallel to and alongside Reesor Road. Approaching and intersecting 16th Avenue, the road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest, continuing to serve as the boundary of urban development in Markham. It narrows to a two lane road, with <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> along the northern side prepared for future northbound lanes, before encountering Ninth Line again. Quickly curving north then east, sandwiched between the neighbourhood of Greenborough and Little Rouge Creek, the route makes a final curve north to end at Major Mackenzie Drive on the northern edge of urban development in eastern Markham.|$|E

5|$|The 1973 Yankees {{held the}} AL East lead {{entering}} August, but faded and ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium before {{the building was}} renovated. The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24million to buy Yankee Stadium and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>land,</b> and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work on the stadium finished in 1976, and the Yankees were required {{to play at the}} Mets' home field, Shea Stadium, in 1974 and 1975. During the first of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games. The Yankees were helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.|$|E
5|$|The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and {{the dancers}} fled the {{building}} as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon. This too, would burn {{to the ground in}} 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.|$|E
25|$|Four cottages, a {{shed and}} a small area of <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> are in the {{ownership}} of the Scottish Indian business tycoon Bobby Sandhu, purchased for £85,000 from the Northern Lighthouse Board.

The official transfer of the land did not actually occur until February 1954.|$|E
25|$|The {{bus station}} {{featured}} a large ridge and furrow design of overall roof, which was subsequently demolished in 1999 {{to allow for}} a rebuilding of the bus station, which was opened in 2001.

25|$|In the {{following}} decades, Tioronda became the railroad's right-of-way, {{making it a}} less desirable location. The church became neglected in turn. So the congregation decided in 1863 {{to build a new}} church elsewhere. One congregant, Charles Wolcott, gave six acres next to the church's then-cemetery. In 1866 he added the <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> of equal size then used as a cemetery by a local Presbyterian church.|$|E
25|$|And {{the city}} of Minneapolis, acting on the {{recommendation}} of its own advisory committee, worked out an option (assignable to Hennepin County) to purchase the Rapid Park land. They agreed to pay $12.95 million plus 5 acres of <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> in exchange for the rights to purchase the 8-acre main ballpark site, effectively agreeing to pay $4.3 million per acre. This agreement expired at the end of 2004 when no stadium bill was passed, but it would {{play a key role in}} the later condemnation proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The 19thcentury also {{witnessed}} {{the establishment of}} the Scottish National Institution for the Education of Imbecile Children on land to the north of present-day Larbert. The institution, opened in 1863 at a cost of £13,000, provided care for minors between the age of 5 and 21. In 1948 the facility became known as the Royal Scottish National Hospital (RSNH). On <b>adjacent</b> <b>land,</b> the Stirling District Lunatic Asylum, opened in 1869 at a cost of £20,000, engaged in the treatment of those with mental illness. The asylum later became known as Bellsdyke Hospital.|$|E

25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory {{was turned into a}} munitions factory {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an incendiary bomb set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed. Some <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> was loaned by a market gardener who subsequently joined the board years later.|$|E
25|$|Millwright George Appel, from Sterling, Illinois, leased the mill, <b>adjacent</b> <b>land</b> and {{buildings}} in 1892. Appel, a recent German immigrant to the United States, oat huller and made oatmeal, corn meal, flour, and bran {{at the mill}} with his son. The mill, properly known as the Malvern Roller Mill or Malvern Milling Company, {{became known as the}} Appel Mill during this time period. The Appel family held the mill from its purchase in 1892 until 1985. Flour and meal, marketed under the Malvern Roller Mill name, was marketed in Sterling, shipped out the railroad and sold in far away location such as New York City and England.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, it was {{revealed}} that the county had budgeted $13.5 million for the land, or about $1.7 million per acre for 8 acres, mistakenly assuming they could acquire it for roughly the dollar amount of the 2004 option agreement between the city of Minneapolis and Land Partners II (the investment group which owned Rapid Park). The dollar amount on that deal had been $12.9 million, though the deal had also included 5 acres of <b>adjacent</b> <b>land.</b> Effectively, it would have paid for only three acres of the 8-acre site that Hennepin County now needed to acquire, at a proposed price of $4.3 million per acre.|$|E
