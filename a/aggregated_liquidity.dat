40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses <b>liquidity</b> and <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The {{topic was}} inspired by the pioneering work of Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2005, 2007), who initiated a new strand of literature about asset pricing in OTC markets. This thesis completes the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model of Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2007), since {{it turned out to be}} imperfect. The thesis starts with an introduction into the basic search and bargaining model by Duffie et al. (2005) for asset pricing in an illiquid OTC market. Illiquidity is modeled with search frictions, which imply that trade does not happen instantly. Upon finding a trading partner, asset prices are directly bargained between those agents. This model forms the basis for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model by Duffie et al. (2007). <b>Aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks are associated with a sudden shift in agents’ preferences towards asset holding, affecting a large fraction of investors simultaneously. Several investors experience a sudden decrease in their liquidity, leading to a forced withdrawal of assets: The market is hit by a selling pressure. This thesis presents an analytical solution method for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model of Duffie et al. (2007) and derives a semi-analytical solution for asset prices. Additionally, it shows how to complete the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model of Duffie et al. (2007), since it turned out to be imperfect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the liquidity effect in the euro area – the link between the availability of <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> and the interbank overnight rate. Applying a set of assumptions which also lead to the “martingale property ” of the overnight rate, a model linking the latter to the expected <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions is formulated and calibrated. Different assumptions for how the market is establishing its expectation and uncertainty about the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions are tested for. It is found that the dynamics of the overnight rate is consistent with market participants having, in aggregate, a rather precise expectation about the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions, however, with an apparent uncertainty which by far exceeds the rather limited variance of the error of this expectation. While the model presented here provides a rather good fit of the overnight rate this indicates that further aspects than just the dynamics of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions need to be included in order to conceptually describe the overnight rate.

40|$|A {{sizeable}} {{stream of}} {{theoretical and empirical}} research in corporate finance reveals that corporate investment and financing activities in capital markets occur in waves through time, which are accompanied with many abnormal phenomena surrounding and after the announcement of events. Motivated by existing studies in firm-level and aggregate-level liquidity, which suggest the influence of (<b>aggregate)</b> <b>liquidity</b> on the activity and quality of corporate events, {{the purpose of this}} thesis is to investigate and understand the role of <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> in explaining existing phenomena associated with corporate investment and financing events including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), initial public offerings (IPOs), seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), and, finally, corporate asset sales. Liquidity is an important and special asset for firms operating in imperfect capital markets. At aggregate level, corporate holdings of liquidity and the market provision of liquidity play important roles in capital markets, which inevitably affect the decision making and performance of corporate events. In this research, I investigate whether corporate investment and financing events occurring during high <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> markets are fundamentally different from those occurring during low <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> markets. Empirical evidences in this research show that the activity and quality of major corporate investment and financing events are substantially influenced by <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Moreover, many of the market anomalies concentrate in certain <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions. For M&A, I find that there are more acquisitions in highliquidity periods, and acquirers buying during high-liquidity markets have significantly higher pre-announcement returns, but lower post-merger abnormal returns. For IPOs and SEOs, results show that there are many more public equity offerings in high-liquidity periods than in low-liquidity periods. Offering firms selling securities during high-liquidity markets have significantly higher occurrences of underpricing (discounting) and suffer larger long-run underperformance.

40|$|We build {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model to analyze how the ability of banks to create money can affect asset prices and financial stability. In the model, demand for liquidity {{takes the form of}} demand for money to make payments. We show that banks can provide elastic <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> by creating and lending out deposits, which will reduce the need for people to sell assets and help maintain asset price stability. We also compare two types of liquidity provision mechanisms. The first is liquidity-risk-sharing through a Diamond-and-Dybvig style coalition that pools together people¡¯s resources, and the second is liquidity provision by banks though money creation. We show that without elastic <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> provided by banks, coalitions can not actually perform their risk-sharing function, their attempt to sell assets to raise liquidity will only make asset prices decrease further, without actually raising more liquidity for shareholders hit by liquidity shocks. However, with banks providing elastic <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity,</b> people can indeed achieve better risk-sharing though coalitions. Finally, we show that the central bank can help banks provide liquidity to the market by lending to banks at low interest rates during the inter-bank settlement process, so as to relax the liquidity constraint of banks.

40|$|We {{examine the}} choice between Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Portfolio Investment {{at the level of}} the source country.

Responding to the concern, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York auctioned Y 2 K options to primary dealers. The options gave the dealers {{the right to}} borrow from the Fed at a predetermined interest rate. Using the implied volatilities of Y 2 K options and the on/off-the-run spread, we demonstrate that the Fed’s action eased the fears of bond dealers, contributing to {{a drop in the}} liquidity premium of Treasury securities. Our analysis shows the link between the microstructure of government debt markets and the central bank’s provision of liquidity. We argue that Y 2 K options and their effects on liquidity premium broadly conform to the economic theory on public provision of private liquidity.

Liquidity is especially paramount when an aggregate shock (or aggregate uncertainty) threatens the overall economy. The liquidity premium and the supply-demand of liquidity ahead of Y 2 K are the focus of our inquiry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to study whether {{actively}} managed mutual funds successfully alter market exposure {{in anticipation of}} changes in <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Specifically, I test whether funds increase (decrease) market exposure prior to increases (declines) in liquidity. Furthermore, I investigate whether certain fund characteristics are related to funds’ success in timing liquidity. As liquidity {{has been shown to}} be positively related to asset returns and negatively related to market volatility, mutual funds could benefit from the ability to predict and time changes in <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Although market liquidity has been identified as an important risk factor affecting asset returns, it hasn’t received much attention in timing literature. My study adds to the so far scarce evidence on mutual funds’ liquidity timing ability. I use monthly return data on 21, 500 actively managed US mutual funds, ranging from January 1980 to December 2010. Fund data come from the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database. The sample contains open-ended equity, fixed income and balanced funds. The Sadka (2006) liquidity shock measure and innovations to average stock turnover and trading volume are used to proxy for market liquidity. My results provide additional evidence that mutual fund managers in fact adjust the level of market exposure prior to changes in <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity.</b> The results are surprisingly consistent across all three liquidity measures and hold in a variety of robustness checks. On average, mutual funds increase market exposure by 2. 8 % to 7. 5 % prior to a one-standard-deviation increase in market liquidity, depending on the liquidity measure used. Funds with riskier investment strategies outperform more conservative funds in timing ability. Evidence on the relationship between timing ability and fund characteristics is weaker, but it seems that successful timers charge higher fees, have higher fund flow volatility, possibly experience higher flows and and trade less.

If they do, banks delay payments to each other, increasing their <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> requirements. It is argued that efficiency is not guaranteed even when banks face repeated interaction in a real payment system, largely because of imperfect information and the competitive dynamics of the payment industry. An efficient outcome can be achieved by the imposition of throughput rules on the value of payments banks must make by a certain deadline. These can both reduce <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> requirements and increase the contestability of the payments market, encouraging a higher degree of direct access to payment systems. Throughput rules could therefore also have risk-reduction benefits if they help to reduce the level of tiering in the financial system. The detailed characteristics of these rules are shown to be important, and a number of design issues are addressed, such as how frequently requirements should be set, and whether throughput rules should apply on an aggregate or bilateral basis. ...|$|R

40|$|The pricing {{of total}} {{liquidity}} risk is {{studied in the}} cross-section of stock returns. The study {{suggests that there is}} a positive relation between total volatility of liquidity and expected returns. Our measure of liquidity is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data. Furthermore, we document that total volatility of liquidity is priced in the presence of systematic liquidity risk: the covariance of stock returns with <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the covariance of stock <b>liquidity</b> with <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity,</b> and the covariance of stock liquidity with the market return. The separate pricing of total volatility of liquidity indicates that idiosyncratic liquidity risk is important in the cross section of returns. This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility of liquidity and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity.
