5|$|In June 1967, the Department of the Interior {{made its}} final {{recommendation}} {{and suggested that}} the dam not be built. Secretary Udall cited the fish and wildlife losses that would result, the availability of less-costly alternatives, {{and the fact that}} no recreational benefits would <b>accrue.</b>|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it <b>accrue</b> to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly <b>accrue</b> to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
50|$|<b>Accrued</b> {{liabilities}} are liabilities {{that reflect}} expenses on {{the income statement}} {{that have not been}} paid or logged under accounts payable during an accounting period; in other words, obligations for goods and services provided to a company for which invoices have not yet been received. Examples would include <b>accrued</b> wages payable, <b>accrued</b> sales tax payable, and <b>accrued</b> rent payable.|$|R

5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can <b>accrue</b> significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits <b>accrue</b> from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E
5|$|The film opened dropped 62% on {{its second}} weekend, earning $32.4 million, and ranking second behind Thor. This result was {{partially}} {{attributed to the}} reduction in IMAX and large-format screens showing the film (reduced from 244 to 20), since IMAX only contributed $510,000 to the film's second-weekend gross. On June 4, 2011, 37 days after release in the US, the film became the first of 2011 to <b>accrue</b> more than $200 million. The film received a one-week re-release in IMAX theaters on September 30, 2011.|$|E
50|$|<b>Accrued</b> revenue (or <b>accrued</b> assets) is an asset, such as unpaid {{proceeds}} from a delivery of goods or services, when such income is earned and a related revenue item is recognized, while cash {{is to be}} received in a later period, when the amount is deducted from <b>accrued</b> revenues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Accrued</b> expense is a {{liability}} whose timing or amount is uncertain {{by virtue of}} the fact that an invoice has not yet been received. The uncertainty of the <b>accrued</b> expense is not significant enough to qualify it as a provision. An example of an <b>accrued</b> expense is a pending obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash is to be paid out in a later accounting period when the amount is deducted from <b>accrued</b> expenses.|$|R

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red jersey with white polka dots. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. First-category climbs awarded the most points; the first six riders were able to <b>accrue</b> points, compared with the first four on second-category climbs, the first two on third-category and only the first for fourth-category.|$|E
5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players <b>accrue</b> points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E
5|$|Off-Road Velociraptor Safari {{is a free}} {{downloadable}} vehicle combat {{video game}} released on January 29, 2008 by Flashbang Studios. The game requires the Unity plug-in to run, and can be downloaded from the developers' website. Players {{assume the role of}} a Velociraptor wearing a pith helmet and monocle, driving a jeep with a spiked flail attached, and must <b>accrue</b> as many points as possible in a four-minute period by performing stunts and running down other Velociraptor. Each time a Velociraptor is struck, the game's speed is reduced to slow motion and its catapulted body becomes the focus of the in-game camera. The game operates a global highscore, after each game the player is given a rank for that day and a separate rank compared to the highest ever scores, along with a breakdown of the bonuses they were awarded during play.|$|E

5|$|On February 5, 2009, TNT {{announced}} {{the addition of}} H–O–R–S–E to its All-Star Weekend coverage. The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to <b>accrue</b> as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to duplicate the shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, 2014, Craig {{was traded}} along with Joe Kelly to the Red Sox in {{exchange}} for John Lackey and prospect Corey Littrell. On May 9, 2015, the Red Sox optioned Craig to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League; since Craig had yet to <b>accrue</b> five years of service time, the Red Sox could option him to the minor leagues without his consent. On May 18, they outrighted him to the minors, removing him from the 40 man roster. He was re-added to the major league roster on September 1. On June 30, 2017, Allen Craig was released by the Triple A affiliate of the Red Sox, the Pawtucket Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|The Mozart family grand {{tour was}} {{a journey through}} western Europe, {{undertaken}} by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At {{the start of the}} tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might <b>accrue</b> from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.|$|E

5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will <b>accrue</b> to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, {{situated}} across the East Drive from the zoo's present location, near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse. Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located {{on the east side}} of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to <b>accrue</b> animals in the first decades of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would <b>accrue</b> to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E

Each climb was categorised as either hors, first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Hors catégorie climbs awarded the most points, with 20points on offer for the first rider across the summit; the first ten riders were able to <b>accrue</b> points towards the mountains classification, compared with the first eight on first-category passes and the first six riders on second-category climbs. Fewer points were on offer for the smaller hills, marked as third-category or fourth-category.|$|E
5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to spend in the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} <b>accrue</b> enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E
