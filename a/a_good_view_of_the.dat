5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E

5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E

25|$|The {{aerial photo}} taken {{in about the}} 1940s {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cottages.

25|$|A main square {{close to}} the golden rock has many establishments that deal in {{religious}} paraphernalia for worship and offerings made by the pilgrims. Adjoining the plaza area is the Potemkin village where restaurants, gift shops, and guest houses are located.

There is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scafell massif and the other Coniston fells are well seen along the ridge to the south. 200 metres north west of the main summit is a distinctive pointed rock, often called the “Matterhorn Rock”.|$|E
25|$|Disaster was {{to strike}} {{in the early}} hours of the 10 June 1886 with the {{eruption}} of Mount Tarawera. Te Puke residents were awoken with the noise and the many related earthquakes. Many had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eruption and paintings survive of their memories. Ash and mud showered over crops and pastures up to 12 inches deep in places. The sun was not seen until 1pm.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular attractions in Bayamón is the Parque de las Ciencias. It is a science-themed park with various {{exhibitions}} and attractions. It is the only place, outside of the United States, where NASA rockets and parts are exhibited. It is located in the middle of karstic hills. An observation building on one of the hills gives <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area. That building also hosts antennas for government and civil communication.|$|E

25|$|The Scots' Church {{is in the}} Neo-Gothic {{style and}} built of Barrabool freestone, with {{dressings}} in Kakanui stone from New Zealand. During the last decades {{of the nineteenth century}} the spire of the Scots' Church was the tallest structure in Melbourne at 210 feet high. The interior features an impressive collection of large and smaller stained glass windows depicting various Christian themes including the Last Supper, basalt aisle columns, timber beamed roof and an elevated floor for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulpit.|$|E
25|$|The top of Lord's Seat is {{a smooth}} grassy dome, the summit being {{marked by the}} meeting point of ruined fences and a small cairn. The view is extensive, {{befitting}} the highest point north of Whinlatter. The Northern Fells are well displayed over Bassenthwaite {{and there is also}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Helvellyn range. Grasmoor and its supporters restrict the southward panorama, but there is no such obstruction to the north, the Scottish Hills being visible across the Solway Firth.|$|E

25|$|Visitors {{are confronted}} by the still-impressive west front, with a wide central doorway, surmounted by a round arch. This western end was {{finished}} comparatively late, in the 13th century, and the round arch of the doorway is meant to complement the earlier work visible through the portal. The massive stonework on either side originally carried {{the weight of a}} great western tower, probably destroyed in the siege, along with the west window. The northern base has suffered least and still has arcading {{at the level of the}} vanished window sill, decorated in a trefoil pattern. The pointed gothic arches of its windows contrast sharply with the late romanesque gateway. Moving through the gateway, it is possible to climb a narrow staircase on the north wall of the nave to the level of the arcade, thus obtaining <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remains of the church and of the landscape beyond. There is a small, well-preserved lavabo on the southern wall of the nave.|$|E
25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible {{to make it easier to}} see the ground.|$|E
25|$|Past {{the formal}} hall, the Second Court is most clearly {{marked by the}} Pepys Building, where the Pepys Library is housed. The {{architect}} and polymath Robert Hooke, otherwise best known for coining {{the idea of a}} biological cell, participated in designing this building in 1677, and construction carried on from then until the 1700s because of the college's lack of money. The inscription on the arch in front of the building, Bibliotheca Pepysiana 1724, refers to the year in which the Pepys Diary was donated to the college, rather than the year in which the building was completed. Because of the famous Pepys Diary, the Pepys Library became a popular tourist destination in Cambridge. The ground and basement levels of the Pepys Building host the college library where undergraduate course books are available, and is therefore a major study spot for undergraduates. The Pepys Building was constructed {{in such a way that}} it would provide <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fellows' Garden.|$|E
