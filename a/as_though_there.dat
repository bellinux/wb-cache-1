500|$|The {{major sources}} for {{the lives of women}} in {{classical}} Athens are literary, political and legal, and artistic. [...] As women play a prominent role in much Athenian literature, it initially seems <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> {{is a great deal of}} evidence for the lives and experiences of Athenian women. However, the surviving literary evidence is written solely by men: ancient historians have no direct access to the beliefs and experiences of Classical Athenian women. [...] It is because of this that John J. Winkler writes in The Constraints of Desire that [...] "most of our surviving documents simply cannot be taken at face value when they speak of women".|$|E
500|$|Kate {{made her}} own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was {{probably}} taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio {{doors at the}} back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> was a draught, which is when {{she saw that the}} bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming [...] "Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} to promote {{the release of the}} novel, Gibson revealed that {{one of the issues that}} had most affected his writing process since Pattern Recognition was the sense that everything in the text was potentially searchable online. [...] "It's <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is a sort of invisible hyperlink theoretical text that extends out of the narrative of my novel in every direction", he commented. A recipient of an advanced reading copy initiated Node Magazine, a literary project in the guise of the novel's fictional magazine, with the intent of annotating the novel. The author, under the nom de plume patternBoy, mobilised a cadre of volunteers to track the references and collate the cloud of data surrounding the work – those elements of the story with footprints on internet resources such as Google and Wikipedia. The project had precedent in Joe Clark's , an attempt at logging and annotating Pattern Recognition, but whereas that took several years to develop, Node was complete before the novel was even published.|$|E

[...] Following stints backing recitals by Beat poet Royston Ellis at the Mermaid Theatre between 1960–61, and singer Red E. Lewis, he was asked by singer Neil Christian to join his band, the Crusaders, after Christian had seen a fifteen-year-old Page playing in a local hall.

Ukrainian officials insisted that Tymoshenko was receiving all necessary treatment. The First Deputy Chairman of Parliament's health care committee and Tymshenko's former physician, Viacheslav Perederiy, stated [...] "The medical station has the standards of a squalid rural first-aid post.

2500|$|In online messaging, a slash {{might be}} used to imitate the {{formatting}} of a chat command (e.g., writing [...] "/fliptable" [...] <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> were such a command) or the closing tags of languages such as HTML (e.g., writing [...] "/endrant" [...] to end an ironic diatribe or [...] "/s" [...] to mark the preceding text as sarcastic). A pair of slashes is sometimes used as a way to mark italic text, where no special formatting is available (e.g., /italics/). A single slash is sometimes used as a way of expressing a check mark, with the meaning [...] "OK", [...] "got it", [...] "done", or [...] "thanks". In Japan, a set of multiple forward slashes (typically three: ///) is used to convey shyness or embarrassment, owing to the way blushing is depicted in manga. These slashes are usually placed {{at the end of a}} statement.|$|E
2500|$|Although from a Protestant background, Brother Roger {{received}} the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist at the Catholic mass celebrated every morning in his monastery. In addition, he {{received the}} sacrament from both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, seemingly in contravention of canonical prohibitions reserving the sacrament exclusively to those in full communion with the Catholic Church. Though, according to Cardinal Walter Kasper, this was accomplished <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> was a tacit understanding between Brother Roger and the Catholic Church [...] "crossing certain confessional" [...] and canonical barriers through what Brother Roger called a gradual enrichment of his faith with {{the foundations of the}} Catholic Church including [...] "the ministry of unity exercised by the bishop of Rome." [...] Brother Roger thus appeared to have undertaken a step without precedent since the Protestant Reformation: entering progressively into full communion with the faith of the Catholic Church possibly without a formal [...] "conversion" [...] that would imply a break with his origins. In 1980, during a European Meeting in Rome, he said in Saint Peter’s Basilica in the presence of Pope John Paul II: I have found my own identity as a Christian by reconciling within myself the faith of my origins with the mystery of the Catholic faith, without breaking fellowship with anyone.|$|E

2500|$|It was reported, however, {{that the}} rescue {{operation}} was [...] "chaotic". BBC journalist Zeesha Zafar reported that [...] "there were fewer rescue workers there than {{one would have}} expected. A majority of them {{were members of the}} anti-terrorism police. Most of them just stood around, gazing at the burning debris, and looking <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> was not much that they could do." [...] He stated that a police officer threatened to baton charge rescuers if they did not [...] "move quickly". Zafar reported that [...] "just when the rescuers were shuffling to get to work, a policeman in plain clothes announced that an army helicopter was coming in to pour water on the fire, and that everyone should get out of the way. The work stopped. The helicopter came, circled on the spot a couple of times, and went away. No water." [...] Zafar went on that it [...] "was distinctly obvious that there was no co-ordination between the workers of different departments such as the police, the rescue department, the Capital Development Authority and the military ... Rescuers operated in a chaotic manner, scouring through the debris that was not on fire ... During the two hours that I stayed at the scene, I saw rescuers collect three separate loads of body parts which they tied up in shrouds. There was no telling how many people they belonged to." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{fish that}} is still unmentioned, which it is {{scarcely}} advisable to speak about on account of its size, because it will seem to most people incredible. There are only a very few who can speak upon it clearly, because it is seldom near land nor appears where it may be seen by fishermen, and I suppose {{there are not many}} of this sort of fish in the sea. Most often in our tongue we call it hafgufa ("kraken" [...] in e.g. Laurence M. Larson's translation). Nor can I conclusively speak about its length in ells, because the times he has shown before men, he has appeared more like land than like a fish. Neither have I heard that one had been caught or found dead; {{and it seems to me}} <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>there</b> must be no more than two in the oceans, and I deem that each is unable to reproduce itself, for I believe that they are always the same ones. Then too, neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such a number as other whales, on account of their vastness, and how much subsistence that they need. It is said to be the nature of these fish that when one shall desire to eat, then it stretches up its neck with a great belching, and following this belching comes forth much food, so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will come to present location, then will gather together, both small and large, believing they shall obtain their food and good eating; but this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while, and the gap is no less wide than that of a great sound or bight, And nor the fish avoid running together there in their great numbers. But as soon as its stomach and mouth is full, then it locks together its jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed, that before greedily came there looking for food.|$|E
