The {{referendum}} there. in July 1947 had been tainted by low electoral turnou,t <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 {{percent of the population}} were allowed to vote. On 22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the elected government of Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan. Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite his being a Kashmiri. On 12 August 1948 the Babrra massacre in Charsadda occurred there, resulting in the death of 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement.|$|E

5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael Massing {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's presentation style, acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney {{on the subject of}} civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech came across <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a neutral presentation.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> ideal for jazz groups because it is more expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> successful.|$|E

5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere {{to the east}} of the anti-meridian, are officially monitored by either the National Hurricane Center or the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored, non-frontal synoptic disturbance, that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre. The region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance, that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Once either of these classifications are met, then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression, if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 33kn (38mph; 62km/h). However, if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours, then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone. Should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34–63kn (39–73mph; 63–118km/h), then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name.|$|E

25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see.

25|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{and radiation}} therapy are the mainstays {{of treatment for}} most head and neck cancers and remain the standard of care in most cases. For small primary cancers without regional metastases (stage I or II), wide surgical excision alone or curative radiation therapy alone is used. More extensive primary tumors, or those with regional metastases (stage III or IV), planned combinations of pre- or postoperative radiation and complete surgical excision are generally used. More recently, as historical survival and control rates are recognized <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> satisfactory, {{there has been an}} emphasis on the use of various induction or concomitant chemotherapy regimens.|$|E
25|$|Non-possessiveness: Many polyamorists view {{excessive}} {{restrictions on}} other deep relationships <b>as</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> desirable, as such restrictions {{can be used}} to replace trust with a framework of ownership and control. It is usually preferred or encouraged that a polyamorist strive to view their partners' other significant others (often referred to as OSOs) in terms of the gain to their partners' lives rather than a threat to their own (see compersion). Therefore, jealousy and possessiveness are generally viewed not so much as something to avoid or structure the relationships around, but as responses that should be explored, understood, and resolved within each individual, with compersion as a goal.|$|E
