In contrast, other <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> residues do not have such “RBS-links” and do not impact receptor-binding affinity upon mutation.

In this paper, we have carried out studies on human hemagglutinin protein from H 5 N 1 strain with homologous hemagglutinin from non-human sources of H 5 N 1 strains. In all strains, part of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> (128 - 141) predicted by computer program “Antigenic”, corresponds to immunodominant site Sa of H 1 subtype. In AAF 02304 strain, A 156 →S 156 mutation lies at the antigenic subsite of site 2 that corresponds to site B in the H 3 subtype. In some strains of non-human origins, there are mutations at the antigenic sites. Interestingly, in AAY 56367 strain mutation L 138 →H 138 lies at the receptor binding site, which also overlaps the <b>antigenic</b> <b>site.</b> Therefore, this amino acid substitution may influence both the specificity of receptor recognition and antibody binding. Seven potential glycosylation sites in human HA and in some strains of non-human sources have been predicted by computer program, Scan Prosite.

Little is known, however, about antibody levels against multiple F-specific epitopes induced by infection or after vaccination against RSV, while this is important to guide the evaluation of (novel) vaccines. In this study we analyzed antibody levels against RSV proteins and F-specific epitopes in human sera and in sera of vaccinated and experimentally-infected cotton rats; and the correlation thereof with virus neutralization. Analysis of human sera revealed substantial diversity in antibody levels against F-, G (attachment) -, and F-specific epitopes between individuals. The highest correlation with virus neutralization was observed for antibodies recognizing prefusion-specific <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> Ø. Nevertheless, our results indicate that high levels of antibodies targeting other parts of the F protein can also mediate a potent antiviral antibody response. In agreement herewith, sera of experimentally infected cotton rats contained high neutralizing activity although lacking <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> Ø-specific antibodies. Strikingly, vaccination with formalin-inactivated (FI) -RSV exclusively resulted in the induction of poorly neutralizing antibodies against postfusion-specific <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> I, although antigenic sites I, II and IV were efficiently displayed in FI-RSV. The apparent immunodominance of <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> I in FI-RSV likely explains the low levels of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination and challenge, and may play a role in the vaccination-induced enhancement of disease observed with such preparations. IMPORTANCE: RSV is an importance cause of hospitalization in infants. The development of a vaccine against RSV has been hampered by the disastrous results obtained with FI-RSV vaccine preparations in the 1960 s that resulted in vaccination-induced enhancement of disease. To get a better understanding of the antibody repertoire induced after infection or after vaccination against RSV, we investigated antibody levels against fusion (F), attachment (G) protein and F-specific epitopes in human and animal sera. The results indicate the importance of prefusion-specific <b>antigenic</b> <b>site</b> Ø antibodies as well as of antibodies targeting other epitopes in virus neutralization.
