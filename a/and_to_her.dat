5|$|Hsu {{was still}} {{actively}} involved in charity work after turning 110. An advocate of healthy living, Hsu often gave public talks at schools, welfare homes, and hospitals in Singapore and overseas about health and service to the needy. When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity, Hsu attributed her good health to a spartan lifestyle, vegetarian diet, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> positive attitude towards life.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) {{performing}} a special surgery, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> dismay, {{the chief of}} surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) is absent from the operating room. At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), {{over whether or not}} he should report the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s alcoholism to Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), the hospital's president.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{book of the}} Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{completed}} by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731, celebrates the monastery at Ely and focuses on Æthelthryth's piety and the translation of her relics. Bede does not mention the matrilinear succession established at Ely by Æthelthryth, where power passed in turn to Seaxburh before subsequently transferring to Seaxburh's daughter Eormenhild <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> granddaughter, Werburh. He praises the virtues of Æthelthryth, a princess who was married twice but still preserved her virginity. Seaxburh receives little praise from Bede, as she had borne children before becoming a nun. He only mentions Seaxburh's marriage to Eorcenberht, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics.|$|E
5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} {{what has happened to the}} town <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E

5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards {{the end of her life}} she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E
25|$|During Marina's performance, {{other artists}} {{performed}} for her. For example, Amir Baradaran replicated her manner of dress. He approached Abramović and proposed marriage {{to her body}} <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> body of work: “I love you, Marina,” he said.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} book contributed to {{a sharp decline in}} Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> increasing alienation from it.

25|$|By 1153, son {{and mother}} had been reconciled. Since the civil war, Baldwin had shown his mother great respect. Melisende's connections, {{especially}} to her sister Hodierna, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> niece Constance of Antioch, meant that she had direct influence in northern Syria, a priceless connection since Baldwin had himself broken the treaty with Damascus in 1147.|$|E

Under pressure from all sides, Noriko consents to the arranged marriage.|$|E
25|$|Bertha fell mysteriously ill, {{suffering}} the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid {{with a sword}} and waited until a large black creature crawled onto his niece's bed <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> neck. He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast, which {{took the form of}} Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died immediately afterward.|$|E

25|$|Mary (or Polly {{as she was}} called) {{divorced}} her alcoholic husband <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> family's dismay married Crosby. Two {{days later}} they left for Europe, where they devoted themselves to art and poetry. Both enjoyed a decadent lifestyle, drinking, smoking opium regularly, traveling frequently, and having an open marriage. Crosby maintained a coterie of young ladies that he frequently bedded, and wrote and published poetry that dwelled on {{the symbolism of the}} sun and explored themes of death and suicide.|$|E
25|$|In the battling that follows, {{many are}} slain—notably Pallas (a {{close friend of}} Aeneas), who is killed by Turnus, and Mezentius, Turnus's close associate. Mezentius, who has allowed his son to be killed while he himself fled, reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in single combat—an honourable but {{essentially}} futile endeavour. In book 11, another notable, Camilla, a sort of Amazon character, fights bravely but is killed. She has been a virgin devoted to Diana <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> nation; Arruns, the man who kills her, is struck dead by Diana's sentinel, Opis.|$|E

She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
25|$|She has {{recently}} opened an art studio {{with her mother}} under the name Studio Gynning, and has been planning a celebration to mark her ten years anniversary as a professional artist. She is also a jewelry designer. She has also revealed in a newspaper interview that motherhood has affected her art. Her paintings, she has said, are not as dark now as previously, and although in the past she drew mainly portraits, she now paints the whole body. She attributes this to her having become a mother <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sense that she is now a more complete person.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the human}} pyramid {{to the right}} has a {{vigorous}} vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure to her left, the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.|$|E
