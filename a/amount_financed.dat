50|$|Because of the {{improvements}} made in automobile CPI administration, interest in automobile CPI insurance again increased {{through the early}} 2000s to the present day. Additionally, a driving factor behind {{the growth in the}} automobile CPI marketplace has been in the longer duration of loans and higher financed amounts. For instance, by 2014 the average length of a new auto loan had reached 66 months, and the average <b>amount</b> <b>financed</b> for a new vehicle is $27,612, up $964 from 2013. The longer the term of a loan and the higher the <b>amount</b> <b>financed,</b> {{the more likely it is}} that a borrower will be in a negative-equity, or “upside-down,” situation. Borrowers who are upside down are also more likely to default on loan payments, resulting in more repossessions for lenders who then must deal with uninsured damage to repossessed vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|CitiApartments and {{its sister}} {{companies}} bought buildings on credit from outside investors, with down payments {{as low as}} 5% of the total purchase price (as opposed to 30-40%, which is more common for comparable commercial real estate purchases). [...] Because of the high prices paid for buildings, and the high <b>amount</b> <b>financed,</b> the buildings have negative cash flow and cannot support their mortgage. The company's lenders typically provided higher than usual loan reserves that would give CitiApartments sufficient money to make interest payments while also paying off or evicting existing tenants, based on a financial model by which it would replace at least 75% of the tenants within two years.|$|E
5000|$|Real estate {{assets are}} {{typically}} very expensive {{in comparison to}} other widely available investment instruments (such as stocks or bonds). Only rarely will real estate investors pay the entire amount {{of the purchase price}} of a property in cash. Usually, {{a large portion of the}} purchase price will be financed using some sort of financial instrument or debt, such as a mortgage loan collateralized by the property itself. The amount of the purchase price financed by debt is referred to as leverage. The <b>amount</b> <b>financed</b> by the investor's own capital, through cash or other asset transfers, is referred to as equity. The ratio of leverage to total appraised value (often referred to as [...] "LTV", or loan to value for a conventional mortgage) is one mathematical measure of the risk an investor is taking by using leverage to finance the purchase of a property. Investors usually seek to decrease their equity requirements and increase their leverage, so that their return on investment(ROI) is maximized. Lenders and other financial institutions usually have minimum equity requirements for real estate investments they are being asked to finance, typically on the order of 20% of appraised value. Investors seeking low equity requirements may explore alternate financing arrangements as part of the purchase of a property (for instance, seller financing, seller subordination, private equity sources, etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{tax system}} of the U. S. and the capital-exporting country combine to affect the flow of foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) into the U. S. First, using aggregate data, it corroborates earlier work suggesting that the U. S. effective tax rate does influence the amount of FDI financed by transfers of funds, but not the <b>amount</b> <b>financed</b> by retained earnings. The data are then disaggregated by major capital-exporting countries to see if, as theory would suggest, FDI from countries which exempt foreign-source income from taxation is more sensitive to U. S. tax rates than FDI from countries which attempt to tax foreign-source income. The data analysis does not reveal a clear differential responsiveness between these two groups of countries, suggesting either difficulties in accurately measuring effective tax rates or the availability of financial strategies which render the home country tax system immaterial in affecting the return on FDI. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an econometric model to estimate the risk of default on financing granted by a public financial institution in the state of Minas Gerais. In elaborating this model data from contracts, socioeconomic inputs of partners and guarantors of and economic-financial information of the companies were used from a sample of 9, 232 firms drawn from a population of 25, 616 cases of financing for micro and small enterprises made between Jun. / 97 and Dec. / 05. A Hierarchical Logistic Regression Analysis was used in which the dependent variable was the quality of credit as defined by timely payments or default of the loan transaction. A total of 22 independent variables related to the contract, the company and the partners/guarantors were used of which five emerged as important in predicting insolvency and correctly classifying 88. 5 % of the companies. In conclusion, one can say that the <b>amount</b> <b>financed</b> and hence the proportion of this funding consumed bring about conditions for default, while the value of the assets of the guarantor in relation to the financing, the value of fixed investments and the age of the company act as protectors against default...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} agency model of {{financial}} contracting. We derive long-term debt, {{a line of}} credit, and equity as optimal securities, capturing the debt coupon and maturity; the interest rate and limits on the credit line; inside versus outside equity; dividend policy; and capital structure dynamics. The optimal debt-equity ratio is history dependent, but debt and credit line terms are independent of the <b>amount</b> <b>financed</b> and, in some cases, {{the severity of the}} agency problem. In our model, the agent can divert cash flows; we also consider settings in which the agent undertakes hidden effort, or can control cash flow risk. (JEL G 30, G 32, G 35, D 82, D 86, D 92) We develop a model of long-term financial contracting and derive debt and equity as optimal securities. Our analysis captures the optimal coupon and maturity structure for long-term debt; the interest rate and credit available on a line of credit; debt versus (outside) equity financing; and dividend policy. The model has implications for how a firm’s capital structure varies over time. The scenario we consider involves an agent who raises external capital to finance a business opportunity. Among investors ’ concerns in funding a business is that the agent might divert funds to himself, or consume other private benefits, at the expense of investors. Our analysis focuses on this agency problem. Specifically, in the model, a risk-neutral agent seeks funding from riskneutral investors. The funding will finance a business that requires an investment in assets and generates risky cash flows over the next T periods. The agent observes the realizations of these cash flows but investors do not. The agency problem is that the agent can underreport the cash flow, diverting the cash flow for his own private benefit. At any time during the life of the business, the business can be terminated. In the event of termination, the agent is left to pursue his best alternative and investors are free to make optimal use of the assets. The termination threat is the key to inducing the agent to share the cash flow with investors. A contrac...|$|E

MM. 	This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} external factors of murabahah financing at Bank Muamalat Indonesia. Bank Indonesia rate is the interest rate that reflects the {{stance of monetary policy}} set by Bank Indonesia. Interest rates affect the interest rates on conventional bank loans, but the interest rate does not affect the Islamic banks. The situation will be a good opportunity for Islamic banks because it can increase the <b>amount</b> of <b>financing</b> products, In particular the financing murabahah Islamic banks. The increased <b>amount</b> of <b>financing</b> creates not only goods but also services in the community. The high demand for aggregate encourages additional production of the company, so it will simultaneously affect the gross domestic product. 	The problems of this research are 1) Is there a causality of gross domestic product with Bank Indonesia rate period 2008 - 2016 ?. 2) Is there a causality of gross domestic product with the number of murabahah financing at Bank Muamalat Indonesia period 2008 - 2016 ?. 3) Is there a causality Bank Indonesia Rate with the number of murabahah financing at Bank Muamalat Indonesia period 2008 - 2016 ?. the purpose of this research is to determine the causality of gross domestic product, Bank Indonesia rate, and the <b>amount</b> of <b>financing</b> murabahah in Bank Muamalat Indonesia period 2008 - 2016. The data used in this research is secondary data. The sample used in this research is data quarterly gross domestic product, Bank Indonesia rate, and the financial statements of Bank Muamalat 2008 to 2016. As for this research analysis uses cointegration and granger causality test. The results consider that the variables of the research is no long-term relationship between these three variables based on cointegration test. Meanwhile, according to granger causality test shows a unidirectional causality between variables gross domestic product and murabahah financing. There is a unidirectional causality between variables Bank Indonesia rate and murabahah financing, is only Bank Indonesia rate encourages financing murabahah significant statistically and not vice-versa.
