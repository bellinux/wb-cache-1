40|$|A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) {{model of}} the Irish economy is built and used to analyse the 2003 Mid Term Review (MTR) of the Common Agricultural Policy. The MTR {{represents}} significant reform of agricultural policy in the EU, and has generated widespread interest and numerous studies of its anticipated effects. Economists have employed a variety of modelling approaches, encompassing single and multi-country general and partial equilibrium models. This research contributes a dedicated single country CGE modelling analysis of the MTR for Ireland. IMAGE 2 is a CGE model with particular emphasis on the agriculture and food processing sectors, and the careful representation of CAP instruments. The database is the most detailed and current CGE database of the Irish economy. Results from the simulation indicate that agricultural activity will decline following {{the implementation of the}} MTR. In particular, labour use in the sector will fall, as some agricultural workers seek off-farm employment and others cease to work. Despite the decline in agricultural activity, the continuation of subsidy support ensures that gross value added at factor price is maintained, and even increases slightly in the short run. There is a change in primary factor usage in agriculture, with significant extensification stimulated by the MTR. Within the sector, there are large changes in the composition of agricultural output. Reductions in output of the previously <b>subsidised</b> <b>products,</b> cattle, sheep and cereals, are accompanied by an increase in output of other agricultural goods such as other livestock, fruits and vegetables, and forestry. Advance estimates of agricultural activity in 2005, the first full year of decoupling, indicate that changes in the sector have followed these broad indications.

40|$|The USA {{has called}} for a five-year {{deadline}} for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies at an informal meeting of the WTO Committee on Agriculture on June 3 rd- 4 th 2002, according to the ICTSD BRIDGES Weekly Trade News Digest.. In its report it noted, however, that this demand came at a time of heavy criticism of the US Farm Bill, and pointed out that the EU rejected the establishment of such deadlines as inconsistent with the Doha commitments. These refer only to reductions in all forms of export subsidies, with a view to phasing them out. The EU for its part has consistently sought inclusion of export credits and the activities of state-trading enterprises in discussions on export competition. On the issue of food aid, proposals were made for all food aid to be controlled by an independent body such as the World Food Programme, so that it could not be used as a tool for dumping. However no agreement has been reached on future disciplines on the use of export subsidies, export credit guarantees, and insurance; food aid, the operations of state trading enterprises and export restrictions and taxes as noted in The June 26 th BRIDGES report. Widely divergent views were apparent over the whole range of issues discussed. Comment: With OECD countries using different tools to support their agricultural sectors, the major players want to see stricter disciplines in those areas which others use, whilst allowing continued scope for support in the forms most favoured by their own policy makers. In the mean time ACP countries without the resources to support such export competition can find their markets flooded by <b>subsidised</b> <b>products</b> from one OECD supplier or another.

25|$|The market {{mechanism}} {{for agricultural products}} is not particularly developed given the traditional nature of the agricultural sector and the numerous governmental interventions in the market prices. The market mainly consists {{of a large number}} of retail traders who purchase the crops from the farmers in small quantities and bring them to the major traders in the bazaar, which is the system that was the predecessor to the modern markets. In order to improve market efficiency and transparency, the Iranian government has allowed trading of agricultural products on the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME) for the past seven years. More than 22 different agricultural products are currently traded on the IME and the trading volume for them is approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum. Nonetheless, given the direct impact of the prices of agricultural products on people’s daily lives and welfare, the government actively intervenes in the market by setting prices, importing products in large amounts, <b>subsidising</b> certain <b>products,</b> and restricting exports in order to supply domestic demand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{control in}} remote, forested {{areas of the}} Mekong region relies on {{personal}} protection from mosquito bites. Uptake of these methods may be limited by knowledge {{of the link between}} mosquitoes and malaria as well as social and economic aspects. Understanding barriers to uptake will inform malaria control programmes on targets for improvement of delivery. Methods A total 748 key respondents: health providers and village heads, from 187 villages and 25 different ethnic groups, were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Differences in use of personal protection, and knowledge of malaria between groups were analysed using chi-square; and binary logistic regression used for multivariate analysis. Results Malaria knowledge was poor with 19. 4 % of women and 37. 5 % of men linking mosquitoes with malaria, although 95. 6 % knew one or more methods of mosquito control. Virtually all respondents used personal protection at some time during the year; and understanding of malaria transmission was strongly associated with bednet use. Those working in forest agriculture {{were significantly more likely to}} know that mosquitoes transmit malaria but this did not translate into a significantly greater likelihood of using bednets. Furthermore, use of personal protection while woing outdoors was rare, and less than 3 % of respondents knew about the insecticide impregnation of bednets. The use of bednets, synthetic repellents and mosquito coils varied between ethnic groups, but was significantly more frequent among those with higher income, more years of education and permanent housing. The reported use of repellents and coils was also more common among women despite their low knowledge of malaria transmission, and low likelihood of having heard information on malaria within the last year. Conclusion The use of personal protection must be increased, particularly among outdoor workers that have higher malaria risk. However, personal protection is widely used and widely accepted to prevent nuisance biting mosquitoes, with the major barrier to use being affordability. Therefore, social marketing campaigns aimed at women and those that work outdoors that provide highly <b>subsidised</b> <b>products,</b> especially insecticide impregnation kits for bednets and hammock nets are most likely to succeed in lowering malaria morbidity among non Han-Chinese groups in rural China. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{priority}} of every {{government is to}} develop the economy of its country to raise the living standard of the citizenry. Mass transit system plays {{a vital role in}} this quest. The energy demand within the transport subsector is immense. Indeed Ghana <b>subsidises</b> petroleum <b>products</b> by GH¢ 45 million monthly and the government of Ghana is faced with the dilemma of whether or not this subsidy be removed as it is putting pressure on national budget. For this reason the need for energy efficiency management has become imperative. This study assessed the role of mass transit in urban transportation system and how it affects energy demand. Secondary data was used for the study. The study revealed that the use of mass transit would reduce energy demand within the transport sector due to its fuel efficiency potentials. Therefore expanding the intra-city mass transit services within Kumasi Metropolis could offer one of the most effective, efficient and feasible strategy for improving fuel efficiency within the transport sub sector. Therefore policy decision should give attention to metro mass transit services within metropolitan areas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEuropean Unions’ current Common Agricultural Policy {{has been}} moved from <b>subsidising</b> {{agricultural}} <b>products</b> to direct payments to farmers. These payments depend, among others, on whether farmers fulfill their obligations in managing their production in a sustainable manner, protecting the environment, ensuring public health, plant health, animal health and welfare. Thus, farmers have to accept this role; {{to protect the environment}} in order to acquire subsidies. Even more, European Unions’ surveys reveal that Europeans generally believe that it is a main responsibility of farmers to protect the environment. On the other hand there is a decline in farmers, forcing European Union to establish different policy measures and motives for new entrants in agriculture. Such measures support new farmers’ initial establishment and the structural adjustment of their holding afterwards. This paper attempts to identify Greek new (young) farmers’ perceptions about their role as environmental protectors. For this reason a questionnaire was developed and distributed among young farmers participating in the measure 112 ‘Setting up of young farmers’ (Common Agricultural Policy, Pillar II). The survey took place in Central Macedonia in Greece during an educational course series designed for new farmers. In total 254 new farmers answered questions concerning both environmental and cultivation practices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates four {{cross-cutting}} controversies {{in access}} to medicines – aspects of pharmaceutical R&D, equity, generics policy and scale up. Chapter 2 describes {{the state of}} pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). It finds that failure rates remain high with the probability of market entry for vaccines being just 1. 8 %. It is observed that whilst {{it may be difficult}} to predict the future productivity of pharmaceutical R&D from the past, it remains true that the escalating costs of R&D may make investments unaffordable for many diseases affecting low and middle income countries. Chapter 3 addresses the question of equity from the perspective of age and gender. An analysis of 3 diseases across 15 middle and low income countries finds that gender differences are age and condition specific. Such complexity also characterises the analysis of the use of antifungals in life limiting illness in a high income country. Associations between the use of such medicines and age, gender, deprivation and ethnicity were found but the directions of that association are not consistent. In contrast, the use of antipsychotics in the people with dementia, associated with a series of adverse events, is on the decline in England but an antipsychotic was nevertheless used to treat a person with dementia in more than one in eight episodes of hospital care. Chapter 4 describes the success and drivers of pro-generics policies in low and middle income countries. It reveals the extent to which branded generics dominate low and middle income markets, and the marked variations between regions. A deeper analysis of the drivers of prescribing in Brazil suggests that the extent of out of pocket payments to be made by the patient affected doctors’ prescribing choices, perhaps heralding in a new phase in generic policy development where patients are encouraged to raise concerns over price with their doctor. Chapter 5 concerns itself not with policy but with how it should be financed and implemented. It finds that the ring fenced Cancer Drug Fund in England may lead to greater inequalities between disease groups than was envisaged. It also echoes the calls from social marketing organisations and donors for a total market approach. In Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal <b>subsidised</b> <b>product</b> may be replacing unsubsidised product. This constrains further private sector investment and is seen as an inefficient use of donor funds. Chapter 6 highlights the methodological and policy implications. It observes that gender and age discrimination may be more complex than assumed. It notes the growing focus of donor organisations on utilising the skills and/or capacity of the private sector and the potential wider role of the patient. In particular it emphasises the importance of contextual information for both policy evaluation and implementation, suggesting that such information may fall into a category of pre-competitive research and, as such, may be more open to initiatives that take advantage of the “wisdom of crowds”. In this light it discusses the potential of such open platforms as Citizendium that give expert authors both a particular role and recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{contained in}} the YHEC report indicates that the report did not consider adequately the role of competition {{in the market for}} health insurance. This is a major weakness and appears in part to be due to a late deletion of competition from the report’s final research brief by the HIA. (p. 90) The evidence on the average age of BUPA Ireland members, 38 years and VHI members, 44 years provides no basis for transfers from BUPA Ireland to VHI. In the case of females between 38 and 44 years health expenditures decline with extra years. The regressiveness of the transfers and cross subsidies in Irish health insurance under community rating is illustrated by the internal transfers from low cost profitable Plans A and B within VHI to high cost loss making Plans C, D and E. Under the proposed transfer of € 34 m a year from BUPA Ireland to VHI a low cost BUPA essential health insurance cover with a premium of € 272. 39 would be levied to cross subsidise VHI Plan E costing € 1, 316. 33 per adult. The price of the most expensive <b>subsidised</b> <b>product</b> under the HIA proposal is 4. 8 times the price of the product to be levied in order to finance the cross subsidisation. The average BUPA premium was € 327 while the average VHI premium was € 435. The price of the average <b>product</b> to be <b>subsidised</b> is therefore 33 % greater than the price of the average product to be levied to finance the cross subsidisation. CSO data confirms that expenditure on health insurance rises over all ten income deciles. Incomes in the top decile are 10. 1 times those in the bottom decile but health insurance expenditure is 22. 9 times greater. Section C of this report deals with the HIA letter to BUPA Ireland requiring the equalisation payment of € 34 m annually from BUPA Ireland for transfer to VHI which had operating profits of € 73. 3 m (before unexpired risk reserve) in their accounts to February 2004. The HIA presents no analysis of the rationale for the payment. It mistakenly asserts that consumers as a whole will be better off from levying one firm in order to cross-subsidise another. It asserts without evidence that the payments required are significant, rising, likely to rise further in the absence of risk equalisation and that in their absence the stability of the industry will be threatened. While there is recognition of possible withdrawal from BUPA Ireland of some younger members because of the price rise in order to finance payments to VHI there is no recognition in the letter of the benefits of competition to health insurance consumers. Section D examines the competition issues neglected by both YHEC and HIA and the benefits foregone by the anti-competitive levies imposed on BUPA. The Irish health service is characterised by high costs and rent-seeking by producers which are extreme by EU standards. The scope for immediate cost savings and further future leveraged savings in a high cost health service is therefore large but these benefits are foregone by regulators adopting the anticompetitive levies recommended by the regulator in this sector. ...|$|R
40|$|National oil {{companies}} (NOCs) control over 80 percent of world oil reserves and over 50 percent of gas reserves and hold {{exclusive rights to}} exploration and development {{of oil and gas}} reserves within their home countries. Because of host government involvement and supervision, NOCs may also act as instruments of state, implementing government foreign and domestic policies such as wealth re-distribution through the provision of <b>subsidised</b> oil <b>products,</b> job creation, and economic development. Such activities can lead to restricted availability of funds for finding and developing reserves for future production and to inefficiencies in current production and distribution. This thesis assesses the geopolitical factors that influence the conduct, strategies and priorities of NOCs and how these may impact on the continuing security of energy supplies to countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It will focus on ten NOCs supplying oil to world markets and two which supply gas to the European market. The study will also review the activities and. scope for influence as state instruments of Sovereign Wealth Funds which have been established by states with NOCs, in particular, those which have earned substantial petro-dollar surpluses, during the period of high oil and gas prices of 2006 - 2008. In an age of global interdependence between nations, specific objectives of this thesis are to consider the implications of anticipated growth in world demand for oil and gas supplies over the next 20 years, whether world production capacity is likely to grow to meet increases in world demand, the potential impact on world oil and gas supplies of the policies and practices of NOCs, in particular, the desire of host governments to require NOCs to follow non- commercial objectives, and the responses from OECD countries to threats to their energy security from potential restrictions on supplies.

40|$|The present {{working paper}} aims to {{evaluate}} the current state, development and competitiveness of Estonian agriculture, based on the theoretical concept of the competitiveness of an industry. By means of analysis {{it is possible to}} predict what potential changes may occur in the agricultural sector after Estonia’s EU accession. In outline, the present paper will discuss the concept of the competitiveness of an industry and the complex of factors influencing competitiveness, evaluate the impact of the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on the economies of candidate countries, analyse the factors determining the environment in which the Estonian agricultural production has to compete in the period prior to joining the European Union and assess the impact of foreign trade on the development of Estonian agriculture. Since 1991 the agricultural production has been steadily declining in Estonia. Due to the tendency to ignore the need for an agricultural policy that would consider the realities of global economy, in Estonia this sector has been left without protection. A substantial competitive disadvantage, caused by the Government’s economic policy, has brought about {{a situation in which the}} local producers lack capital for developing the industry, while foreign capital is not attracted. The agricultural producers, who have to dispense with government support, are unable to simultaneously handle three difficult problems: Transition from large-scale farming to small-scale farming that requires the introduction of modern technology and equipment; Loss of traditional foreign markets (Russia); Unfair competition with governmentally <b>subsidised</b> EU <b>products,</b> not only in foreign markets, but also in the internal market. Only equalisation of the conditions of competition in the European Union and in Estonia’s agricultural sector would make it possible to use the great natural potential of Estonia for the benefit of its economic development. Resolving this problem will be the most difficult task facing Estonia’s (foreign) economic policy during the negotiations for admission to the EU. A continuing agricultural decline would mean the loss of an opportunity to exploit those natural resources even after joining the EU, because the pre-accession level of production will determine the production quotas. ...|$|R
5000|$|The United States' [...] "War on Drugs" [...] {{has added}} {{considerably}} {{to the political}} instability in South America. The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, paramilitary and guerrilla groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems. Within Bolivia, the political rise of current president Evo Morales {{is directly related to}} his grassroots movement against US-sponsored coca-eradication and criminalization policies. However, coca has been cultivated for centuries in the Andes. Among their various legitimate uses, coca leaves are chewed for their mild stimulant & appetite suppression effects, and steeped as a tea which is known to reduce the effects of human altitude sickness. Rural farmers in the poor regions in which coca has historically been cultivated often find themselves at the difficult and potentially violent intersection of government-sponsored eradication efforts, illegal cocaine producers & traffickers seeking coca supplies, anti-government paramilitary forces trafficking in cocaine as a source of revolutionary funding, and the historical hardships of rural subsistence farming (or the its typical alternative - abandoning their land and fleeing to an urban slum). In some regions, farmers' coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments (usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination), whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade, thereby destroying their livelihoods. Agricultural producers in these countries are pushed further to grow coca for the cocaine trade by the dumping of <b>subsidised</b> farming <b>products</b> (fruit, vegetables, grain etc.) produced by Western countries (predominantly US and EU agricultural surpluses) (see BBC reference, below), which reduces the prices they could otherwise receive for alternate crops such as maize. The net effect can be a depression of prices for all crops, which can both make the farmer's livelihood more precarious, and make the cocaine producers' coca supplies cheaper.|$|R
40|$|Administration of {{the growth}} hormone bovine {{somatotropin}} (bST) is known to increase milk production in lactating cows making the technology attractive for use in commercial dairying. BST a cost reducing and output enhancing technology is used in some countries while others including New Zealand have not approved {{the use of the}} hormone. Studies indicate {{that as a result of}} bST use by some major dairy producers, low cost or <b>subsidised</b> dairy <b>products</b> could enter international trade to damage competitive positions of other major dairy exporters not adopting the technology. New Zealand's dairy industry is particularly vulnerable to such a situation. The objectives of the study were to estimate potential response and evaluate the profitability of bST use in New Zealand dairy farms. Response to bST is highly dependent on the level of animal nutrition and most available information is for stall fed cattle. The study attempts to estimate the potential for bST in a pasture based dairy management system in New Zealand. Twelve sites representative of the major dairying regions of New Zealand were selected. Data on pasture growth rate were compiled from published data or where such data were unavailable were generated through computer modelling. Response to bST was assumed to be a function of pre-grazing herbage mass. Regional bST response were calculated on this basis. The study assumed a 150 day bST treatment period for seasonal herds in New Zealand. The profitability of bST use was estimated in five 30 day sub periods for the twelve sites used in the study. The incentive to use bST on New Zealand dairy farms is assessed on the basis of a required return to management. Results reveal that feasibility of bST use in New Zealand dairy farms are closely linked to pasture growing conditions. For the Northland, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki and Southland sites where pasture growth is consistent, bST use is feasible throughout the 150 day treatment period considered in the study commencing from peak lactation. For the balance of North Island sites which included Waikato, Rangitikei, Manawatu and Wairarapa districts, the drier summer condition and relatively high stocking rates prevailing made bST use feasible only during the first half of the lactation cycle. For the South Island sites excluding the dry Central Otago site, bST could be profitable only during the second half of the lactation cycle because of the colder winters and late spring. The study identifies how bST could be manipulated by the New Zealand dairy farmer to maximize returns. The findings are that bST could be used selectively to enhance profits on New Zealand dairy farms. If at some stage bST were approved for use in New Zealand, dairy farmers would be aware of the implications. Secondly, it provides a base to survey the attitudes of dairy farmers to know of the likely adoption rates for a better understanding on the effects bST would have on the dairy industry of New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|On May 15, 2002, the EU {{posted a}} {{detailed}} {{critique of the}} US farm Bill on its web site. This memo pointed out that: it {{will result in a}} 70 - 80 % increase in US agricultural expenditures over the next six years; it will allow US farmers to be subsidised to the full extent of WTO limits; it will guarantee farmers a given level of income and reduce responsiveness to market signals; it could mean farmers gain more when prices are low, providing no disincentive to over production; it will increase production on marginal land; it will provide greater subsidies when prices are low and over stimulate production; it will drive down prices on world markets. The memo gives a detailed breakdown of the subsidies contained in the Farm Bill, which also includes rather vague environmental programmes. The EU's major criticism is that payments to farmers are directly production related. The EU memo outlines the various ways in which the US is seeking to 'stretch' WTO rules to accommodate the new Farm Bill. Nevertheless, the price depressing effects of the Bill will probably mean that US expenditure ultimately exceeds WTO ceilings. The memo outlines the likely external effects of the new Bill, including: greater volumes of cheap <b>subsidised</b> US <b>products</b> on world markets; a less attractive US market for third country exports as domestic prices are dragged down; more competitive US food processing industries through the availability of cheaper raw materials. The memo also strongly criticises the food aid components of the Bill and the predatory use of export credits and export promotion programmes. The memo seeks to compare EU and US farm aid programmes and raises the following points: The value of EU and US agricultural production was almost identical at about US $ 190 billion. In 2000, the producer subsidy equivalent in the US was US $ 49 billion compared to US $ 90 billion in the EU. Support per full time farmer was US $ 20 000 in the US and US $ 14 000 in the EU. The per capita cost in the US was US $ 338 per annum compared to US $ 276 in the EU. The EU receives 75 % of agricultural exports from developing countries. The EU exports far less to the developing world than the US, whose market share in $ terms is increasing, while the EU's is falling. The EU's system of export subsidies is transparent and disciplined by WTO reduction commitments. Export subsidies are declining in importance and no longer a major source of trade distortions. On the other hand, the US system of export credits is considered a major source of trade distortion. In addition to the EU, the Cairns Group has roundly condemned the new US Farm Bill, maintaining it 'will hurt farmers around the world' and 'undermine efforts to achieve global reform of this heavily subsidised and distorted sector'. Since reducing agricultural subsidies was seen as a key element in any 'Development Round', the US Farm Bill does not bode well for post-Doha agricultural negotiations. Particular concerns have also been expressed in Africa, where it is feared the Bill will drive down the prices of commodities on which Africa economies depend. Caribbean governments also feel let down by the new US Farm Bill particularly since their rural economies are already being undermined by cheap subsidised imports. According to Roger Clark, the Jamaican Agricultural Minister, the Bill will require Caribbean governments to 're-think our strategy'. Comment: A number of interesting points emerge from the EU memo on the new US Farm Bill. Firstly, even after the increase in US expenditures, the EU will still be spending more on agricultural support than the US in terms of total production value. Secondly, while EU exports to developing countries declined between 1998 and 2000 from US $ 16. 8 billion to US $ 16. 5 billion, this is largely due to the Euro's depreciation against the US Dollar, which also accounts for the declining US $ denominated value of EU imports from developing countries over the same period. Thirdly, although well founded, the criticisms of the US Farm Bill regarding the effects of the new Farm Bill simply mirror the effects of CAP reform. Beef prices for ACP suppliers have dropped 28 - 30 % since the Agenda 2000 reforms in the beef sector. Likewise EU cereal prices have dropped 50 % since 1992, improving the competitiveness of EU cereal-based food processing industries and the domestic and export competitiveness of the EU feed-based livestock industry: poultry exports have increased 150 % over the period. There has also been a greatly reduced need for export refunds. It is very clear that when the elephants fight, the grass suffers. Hence African and Caribbean governments are deeply concerned by the effects of the US Farm Bill. The situation emerging seems to be that if subsidised EU producers do not get your market, subsidised US producers will. On May 15, 2002, the EU posted a detailed critique of the US farm Bill on its [...] ...|$|R
