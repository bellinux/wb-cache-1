25|$|The {{discussion}} was apparently intended to improve upon {{the account of}} Aristotle's friend and teacher Plato in his Socratic dialogue, the Theaetetus. But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing koina is an active thinking process in the rational {{part of the human}} soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this sensus communis, which is something like a sense, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> thinking, but not rational.|$|E
25|$|Astronaut Gordon Cooper {{reported}} {{suppression of}} {{a flying saucer}} movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|E

[...] In an interview published by MTV, Spore designer Will Wright responded to early criticism that the phases of the game had been dumbed-down by explaining [...] "We were very focused, if anything, on making a game for more casual players. Spore has more depth than, let’s say, The Sims did. But {{we looked at the}} Metacritic scores for Sims 2, which was around ninety, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Half-Life, which was ninety-seven, and we decided— quite a while back— that we would rather have the Metacritic and sales of Sims 2 than the Metacritic and sales of Half-Life".|$|E

In chapel, the school's worship team leads the student body in worship, and guest speakers come to speak the Word of God. Past guests have included Nick Vujicic, Louis Zamperini, <b>and</b> <b>Something</b> <b>Like</b> Silas. Every year, the spiritual life chairman, a student, who is chosen by a committee, proposed a spiritual life theme for the year. The spiritual life chairman is a part of the ASB and presides over the chapel team. The chapel team consists of a group of students who come together to make a few chapels that creatively convey the year's spiritual life theme. This year's spiritual life theme is [...] "God is Greater". Spiritual Life Week, which takes place twice a year, is a week where three days of the school week are set aside for school chapels, which challenge the students' religious life and personal commitment to Christ.
