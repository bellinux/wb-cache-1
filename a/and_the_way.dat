5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions.

5|$|After a gap of two years, Sukumar's next directorial 100% Love (2011) was released.

Sukumar earned another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 59th Filmfare Awards South, and a nomination for the Best Director– Telugu at the 1st South Indian International Movie Awards.|$|E

5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, {{he was able to}} reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E

Early neurologists who made further additions to {{the knowledge of the}} disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E

Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R.

Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.|$|E
