50|$|H-1B-dependence {{itself does}} not trigger any <b>additional</b> <b>fees.</b> However, at various points {{in the history of}} H-1B law, <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> have been levied on {{employers}} satisfying conditions similar to H-1B-dependency. These are employers who have more than 50 full-time employee equivalents and with the number of H-1B and L-1 nonimmigrants at present equal to more than 50% of their current number of FTE equivalents. The corresponding threshold for H-1B-dependency is 15%, but one way these thresholds differ is that the 50% threshold for the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> requires the employer to count people in H-1B as well as people in L-1 status. Also, unlike the case of additional LCA attestations, there is no exemption for people based on how much they are earning or their educational qualifications.|$|R
