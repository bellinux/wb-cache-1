5000|$|Though Bradley's Verdant Green {{has become}} {{something}} of a cult book about Oxford, he had previously produced a series of pen and ink drawings entitled 'Ye freshmonne his adventures at University College, Durham'. He altered the setting on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mark</b> Lemon at Punch. Drawings of 'Durham Student Life' survive in College Life published in Oxford, Cambridge and Durham in 1850.|$|R
6000|$|He disclaimed any {{originality}} for the stories, adding, [...] "I understand [...] that my relations toward Uncle Remus {{are similar}} to those that exist [...] between an almanac maker and the calendar."

500|$|Mark and Monique Beaubien, {{the owners}} and {{builders}} of the hotel, were French Indian traders. In 1826 they moved to Chicago on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mark's</b> brother Jean, who lived at Fort Dearborn. The Beaubiens settled in a small cabin on Wolf's Point and continued their trade with the Indians. They built a tavern on the east bank of the south branch of the Chicago River {{at the point where}} the north and south branches meet. [...] The tavern was named Eagle Exchange Tavern. In 1831, they added a frame to the log structure to create Chicago's first hotel, the Sauganash Hotel. [...] When completed, it was one of only two residential structures on the south side of the main branch of the Chicago River, the other being that of Col. John B. Beaubien, Mark's brother. [...] The settlement had only twelve houses at the time. [...] The hostelry immediately became famous, and when reconstructed later became the city's largest and finest hotel. [...] Immediately adjacent to the hotel's public bar was Chicago's first drug store.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Spillane (born 29 February 1980) was {{eliminated}} on 31 October 2005, placed fifth. After previously auditioning unsuccessfully in earlier seasons, he heeded the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> judge <b>Mark</b> Holden and dedicated {{the next year}} to honing his skills as a performer. He left his employment with his family's real estate business to move to Brisbane {{in order to find}} inspiration. Noted for his rendition of [...] "Gimme Some Lovin'" [...] by the Spencer Davis Group impressed the judges and he was unanimously invited to the next round.|$|R
50|$|In 1841 Rees made, with Samuel Lane, {{observations}} on blood cells, arguing {{that they were}} flattened capsules containing a coloured fluid, and indicating the changes which they underwent on the application of reagents, such as saline fluids and syrup. He subsequently made {{observations on}} {{the nucleus of the}} corpuscle in different animals, and showed the similarity of the white corpuscle to those of lymph and pus. On the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Peter <b>Mark</b> Roget he communicated two papers to the Royal Society—On the Chemical Analysis of the Contents of the Thoracic Duct in the Human Subject (1842), and in June 1847, On the Function of the Red Corpuscles of the Blood, and on the Process of Arterialisation.|$|R
40|$|Parallel Primitives Library. CUDA {{is a new}} {{computing}} architecture {{designed to}} enable the GPU to solve computational rather than visual problems (discussed in section 2. 1). Although powerful in raw performance and capabilities, {{there are very few}} libraries available to the public for CUDA programming. Those interested in CUDA and scientific computing currently must build there programs from scratch, making it very inconvenient and tedious. Our goal with this library, is to allow for reusable libraries that include native GPU primitives and adequate examples to demonstrate their efficacy. One such primitive which was used in this biological sequence alignment algorithm is the scan primitive (discussed in section 2. 2). This primitive is well suited for parallel algorithms, however my work required the primitive be modified from the addition-operator to the maximum-operator. We expanded this change to allow for easily templated scan operations, therefore my work (with the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mark</b> Harris [NVIDIA Researcher]) was to expand the number of binary operators supported (maximum, minimum, addition, multiplication) with little code modification and no significant performance change. With this change, the biological sequence alignment algorithm (discussed in section 2. 3) may use the scan primitive thereby improving performance. 2. 1 CUDA NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) technology allows for complex computational problems to be solved on the GPU 1. Recently introduced to developers, it has immediately become a matter of great interest t...|$|R
50|$|At Glory by Honor, The Prophecy {{refused to}} put any of the titles on the line. The Prophecy wanted Xavier to wrestle someone who he could easily beat and, at the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mark</b> Briscoe, squared off against Jay Briscoe. Despite having lost the {{majority}} of his matches in ROH, Jay scored a major upset by beating the ROH Champion. Later, The Prophecy's hired assassin Samoa Joe (in his Ring of Honor debut) faced Low Ki in ROH's first Fight Without Honor. After losing the hard-hitting battle, Joe showed his true colors by obeying the Code of Honor and shaking Low Ki's hand. In the main event, Daniels faced Doug Williams in a grudge match from Crowning a Champion. Angry over Daniels's refusal to shake his hand after the match, Williams challenged him to a match where if he lost Daniels would have to disband The Prophecy and adhere to the Code of Honor. If Williams lost, however, he would no longer be allowed to shake and therefore continually broke the Code of Honor. After winning, Daniels mocked Williams by offering to shake his hand. Despite some tension between The Prophecy and Samoa Joe, who refused to ruin his integrity by disobeying the Code of Honor, The Prophecy continued to be successful {{for the remainder of the}} year. At Scramble Madness, rival brothers Jay and Mark Briscoe faced each other in a tag match. Jay chose Amazing Red as his partner, while Mark chose Daniels. After winning the match and becoming the newest member of The Prophecy, Daniels told Mark's parents, who were in the front row, that The Prophecy was Mark's family now.|$|R

However, Sarah is lured into the display of the Marquis de Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell), and Mark is pushed into a zombie display by the waxwork's two butlers. Mark is {{approached}} by a horde of zombies, but finds {{that if he does}} not believe in the monsters, then they do not exist and cannot harm him. Mark finds {{his way out of the}} display and into the Marquis de Sade exhibit, where he rescues Sarah, while the marquis vows revenge.|$|R
50|$|Several {{watches and}} {{warnings}} were issued {{in association with}} Alicia. The first ones were a gale warning and a hurricane watch for the area between Corpus Christi, Texas, and Grand Isle, Louisiana, issued on August 16. On August 17, a hurricane warning was issued for the coastline from Corpus Christi to Morgan City, Louisiana, and later for Port Arthur, Texas, southward.Initially, however, residents {{did not take the}} warnings seriously. Galveston Mayor E. Gus Manuel, against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Texas Governor <b>Mark</b> White, ordered the evacuation of only low-lying areas. As a result, only 10 percent of the population living behind the seawall chose to leave when Alicia came ashore. In contrast, about 30 percent of Galveston's population evacuated the island when Hurricane Allen threatened the eastern Texas coastline in 1980.Throughout the day, however, as the increasing winds began to cause damage in Galveston, people grew more concerned. The mayor finally ordered a widespread evacuation of the island after midnight on August 18, but by then, the bridges to the mainland were uncrossable.|$|R
25|$|Yashin's {{relationship}} with the Ottawa Senators reached a new low after the 1998–99 season. Yashin refused to honour {{the final year of}} his contract and demanded a raise (he would have earned $3.6 million USD that year, compared to other star centerman like Steve Yzerman and Joe Sakic who made $6–7 million). When the Senators refused, he demanded a trade on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his agent, <b>Mark</b> Gandler. This was the third time Yashin demanded a new contract during his five years with the team. The Senators refused to trade Yashin, instead stripping him of his captaincy and handing it to Daniel Alfredsson. When Yashin still refused to report, the Senators suspended him {{for the rest of the}} 1999–2000 NHL season on 10 November, with the full support of the NHL. Yashin attempted to sign with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation suspended him from playing internationally until the dispute was resolved. After the season, an NHL arbitrator refused to grant Yashin the free agent status he claimed to have earned, instead tolling his contract for another season on the grounds that Yashin owed the Senators the final year of his contract if he ever returned to the NHL. It was another public relations disaster for Yashin.|$|R
500|$|Shooting {{occurred}} {{in the second half}} of October 2007. [...] The scenes on the freighter in this and later episodes were filmed for several days on a freighter ten to fifteen minutes off the west coast of Oahu, Hawaii, where Lost is filmed. [...] Instead of docking the ship and returning to the ocean each day, the actors and crew slept on the freighter in areas that were not being used for filming. The Oxford scenes were shot at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu. In 1996, Desmond has short hair and no facial hair and in 2004, Desmond sports long and untamed hair with a full beard. [...] Cusick did not cut his hair; it was hidden underneath a short-haired wig by [...] "really talented hair and makeup folks", according to Carlton Cuse. [...] All freighter scenes were shot before Cusick shaved most of his beard for the 1996 scenes. [...] A fake beard was glued onto Cusick for the episodes [...] "Ji Yeon" [...] and [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] while his beard grew back. The equations on Faraday's chalkboard were written by a physicist who was hired as a consultant by the producers. The way the transitions between the 1996 and 2004 scenes would take place was frequently discussed during production. The producers took the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> editor <b>Mark</b> Goldman, who suggested sudden cuts with [...] "no fancy effect, and in some cases, no sound cut", similar to the way [...] "All Good Things..." [...] was edited. The original ending would set up the following episode by having Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) drop a bag containing a gas mask at Faraday's feet. But the producers thought it did not work after the emotional scenes between Desmond and Penny, and decided to finish with Faraday reading his diary.|$|R
