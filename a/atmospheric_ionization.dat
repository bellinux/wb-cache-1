40|$|Abridged) The {{propagation}} of ionizing radiation through model atmospheres of terrestrial-like exoplanets is studied {{for a large}} range of column densities and incident photon energies using a Monte Carlo code we have developed to treat Compton scattering and photoabsorption. Incident spectra from parent star flares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are modeled and compared to energetic particles in importance. We find that terrestrial-like exoplanets with atmospheres thinner than about 100 g cm^- 2 transmit and reprocess a significant fraction of incident gamma-rays, producing a characteristic, flat surficial spectrum. Thick atmospheres (>~ 100 g cm^- 2) efficiently block even gamma-rays, but nearly all incident energy is redistributed into diffuse UV and visible aurora-like emission, increasing the effective atmospheric transmission by many orders of magnitude. Depending {{on the presence of}} molecular UV absorbers and atmospheric thickness, up to 10 % of the incident energy can reach the surface as UV reemission. For the Earth, between 2 x 10 ^- 3 and 4 x 10 ^- 2 of the incident flux reaches the ground in the biologically effective 200 [...] 320 nm range, depending on O_ 2 /O_ 3 shielding. Finally, we suggest that transient <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ionization</b> layers can be frequently created at low altitudes. We conclude that these events can produce frequent fluctuations in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ionization</b> levels and surficial UV fluxes on terrestrial-like planets.

40|$|The decadal {{solar cycle}} {{modulation}} of Earth's radiative forcing via ionization {{of the atmosphere}} by galactic cosmic rays, aerosol formation from the gas phase, and the response of clouds to aerosol is quantified {{for the first time}} with a climate model that represents and couples the relevant processes. Simulations are conducted for solar maximum and minimum conditions, with present-day anthropogenic aerosol and aerosol precursor gas emissions, and contemporary large-scale meteorology. The solar cycle signal appears in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ionization,</b> aerosol formation from the gas phase, aerosol concentrations, aerosol optical depth, and in cloud properties, and is most pronounced at mid-and high latitudes. The resulting solar cycle modulation of Earth's radiative forcing exhibits a distinct hemispheric asymmetry, with peak values of- 0. 14 W m - 2 in the southern and- 0. 06 W m - 2 in the northern mid-latitudes. Globally and annually averaged, the solar cycle modulation of Earth's radiative forcing, arising from the increase in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ionization</b> by galactic cosmic rays from solar maximum to minimum, via charged nucleation of aerosol, the direct aerosol effect, and the cloud albedo effect, amounts to- 0. 05 W m - 2. A limited relevance of this variation for the Earth's atmosphere and climate can be inferred, given that Earth's radiative forcing changes by- 0. 24 W m - 2 from solar maximum to minimum because of a decrease in total solar irradiance. © 2012 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|E
