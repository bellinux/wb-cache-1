He is full of Earthpower, {{as a result of a}} pregnant Hollian (from the second chronicles) being brought back to life by Earthpower. Linden also finds an ally in a Stonedownor, Liand, who quickly comes to trust Linden implicitly when she introduces him to his past and the Land, showing him an expression of Earthpower beyond all his previous experience. The Masters threaten <b>Anele</b> (and indirectly, Linden) as she seeks to find ways of locating and rescuing her son, a quest she keeps to herself.

No fewer than six caesures assail the company, and in the chaos <b>Anele</b> touches the dirt and is possessed by Kastenessen; the mad Elohim immediately kills Liand {{in an effort to}} protect the croyel. After Linden quenches the caesures, the Giants and Stave construct a rocky cairn for the slain Stonedownor, whose lover Pahni is inconsolable. The devastated group is soon attacked again by Roger and an army of Cavewights. During the battle, Galt sacrifices himself to protect <b>Anele,</b> indicating an alteration in the Humbleds stance towards the menace of his Earthpower. <b>Anele</b> then uses Liands orcrest and sacrifices his life to both slay the croyel, and to transfer his innate Earthpower, and heritage as the [...] "Last hope of the Land" [...] into Jeremiah. During the battle, Esmer arrives in yet another attempt to betray Linden for Kastenessen, but is pursued by the ur‑viles, who at last reveal the purpose of the manacles they had forged: they capture Esmer with them, restraining his power and freeing the wild magic to act. Infuriated by the loss of <b>Anele</b> and Galt, and exalted by the rescue of her son, Linden wields the white gold and utterly routs Roger and his Cavewights.|$|E

5000|$|When {{a mystical}} African mantis (Adrian Rhodes) appears to Khumba, he draws a map to {{what could be}} {{interpreted}} as either water or stripes between it.

He also nearly admits the ferocious half-blind African leopard Phango (Liam Neeson) who warns Mkhulu (Ben Vereen) that he and his zebra herd can't stay in their enclosure forever. Seko berates and scolds Khumba for putting the herd at risk and for the next week, he'll drink half of his rations. Lungisa tells the story of how a white horse got its stripes by swimming in a magic river and other horses wanted to have stripes like him, making the zebra we know today.

5000|$|The Harrow and the Ardent {{transport}} Linden and her companions to the Lost Deep, {{the ancient}} {{domain of the}} Viles, to find Jeremiah. There, at the great bridge the Viles called The Hazard, <b>Anele</b> becomes enraptured by the deep stone of the earth, and prophesies that the Worm will ultimately seek the Earthblood as its final sustenance: when the Worm drinks the Earthblood, the Arch of Time will fall. In witnessing this prophecy, the Ardent accomplishes one of his private goals; however, the Harrow fails to open the portal to the Lost Deep. Ultimately it is Linden, using the Staff, {{who is able to}} undo the Viles magic due to the insight she gained from Caerroil Wildwood, and from her personal encounter with the Viles themselves in the Lands past. It is revealed that it was to steal this insight that motivated the Harrows initial attempt to possess Linden, before he was denied by the Mahdoubt. By regaining the Staff, Linden also discovers that far beneath even the Lost Deep slumbers a powerful bane called She Who Must Not Be Named [...] - [...] a tormented avatar of countless betrayed women throughout history, including Kastenessens lover, and the banished wife of the Creator, Diassomer Mininderain. Linden discovers that it is this bane which is the source of Kevins Dirt. The bane slumbers, however, and without any conceivable means to oppose it, the party leaves it sleeping, and enter the Lost Deep.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conflict}} of these forces awakens She Who Must Not Be Named. Linden and her companions follow the ur‑viles and Waynhim in seeking a way out, and {{rely heavily on}} the strength and endurance of Ironhand Coldspray and her Swordmainnir.

The skurj also arrive to worsen the situation. Exposed more intimately to the banes evil than the other party members by her Earthsight [...] - [...] and being a more ready target due to her family history of abuse and despair [...] - [...] Lindens hope finally fails when the party is cornered, and she falls into a catatonic state, deeply traumatized. Covenant first tries to reason with She Who Must Not be Named, then tries to convince Esmer to reveal her true name which would release her. When Esmer refuses, Covenant asks <b>Anele</b> to use Liands orcrest stone to summon the spirits of his parents, Sunder and Hollian. They leave, however, and summon High Lord Elenas spirit as bait for She Who Must Not Be Named. This ploy succeeds at delaying She Who Must Not Be Named from attacking the group. As Elena is being consumed Covenant convinces Esmer to leave them, which allows the Ardent to transport the company away.|$|E

Infelice acknowledges that the Elohim do not have friends when she is informed by the Giants that they will stand by Jeremiah, and allows her and the Elohim to be drawn inside. Jeremiah is possessed by Kastenessen {{in the same way that}} <b>Anele</b> was also possessed by him, but Stave severely hurts himself by throwing Jeremiah onto the top of the structure, away from physical contact with the grass, breaking his possession. Kastenessen himself then appears and towers over the shrine; he raises his human fist (which was originally Roger Covenant's) in an attempt to destroy the shrine and all of the remaining Elohim in the world, but Lostson Longwrath emerges from behind a crater nearby and fulfills his geas by cutting off Kastenessen's hand. Kastenessen kills Longwrath, but before he can summon the Earthpower and fire necessary to destroy the shrine, Covenant appears with Branl and drives Kastenessen back towards Infelice with the krill and wild magic. Kastenessen states that he is only an abomination, but Infelice explains that he is the only Elohim to have ever loved and been loved; she acknowledges that the Elohim have been cruel to him, and asks that he allow them to heal him. Infelice reminds the Giants that Lord Foul desperately wants Jeremiah before entering the structure with Kastenessen. With Kastenessen now isolated from Mount Thunder and She Who Must Not Be Named, Kevin's Dirt disappears.|$|E

40|$|Elevated plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] {{level has}} been {{established}} as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Considerable ethnic group differences {{in the distribution of}} plasma Lp(a) levels have raised public health concerns. Recently, we have reported that Samoans have the lowest plasma Lp(a) levels of any population group. In the present investigation, we report the contribution of two apolipoprotein(a) (APOA) polymorphisms, the kringle 4 type 2 (K 4) repeat and the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR), in affecting plasma Lp(a) levels in an American Samoan sample (n ~ 309). The K 4 repeats ranged in size from 15 to 40. The common aneles contained repeats ranging from 26 to 36 with allele frequencies between 5. 5 % to 9. 7 %, and these accounted for 82 % of an alleles. An inverse relationship between K 4 repeat nnmber and plasma Lp(a) level was observed for single-banded (r ~ - 0. 59, P ~ 0. 0001) and double-banded phenotypes (r ~ - 0. 50, p ~ 0. 0001). This polymorphism explained 60 % of the variation in plasma Lp(a) level in American Samoans. For the PNR polymorphism, five different repeat aneles and eight different genotypes were identified; the most common <b>anele</b> was eight repeats. The * 8 PNR <b>anele</b> was associated {{with a wide range of}} K 4 repeats, the * 9 PNR allele with larger K 4 repeats (25 - 40), and the * 10 PNR with smaller K 4 repeats (15 - 24). Analysis of variance (ANOV A) revealed that the PNR polymorphism accounts for 2. 1 % of the variability in plasma Lp(a) levels in this sample, when the K 4 repeat polymorphism was taken into account.
