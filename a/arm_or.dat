5|$|Gair has now {{developed}} a style {{as a body}} painter. Her typical job takes her and her team eight hours, but some jobs take twice that. She does not charge by the hour. Gair is always well prepared for her jobs, but does not generally sketch her work on paper. In fact, she claims to have only had to do so twice in over twenty years of body painting. When she needs to test something out she usually uses her opposite (left) <b>arm</b> <b>or</b> hand.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} dive bomber units to begin {{operations}} against the radar stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain. The targets {{on the afternoon of}} 18 August were RAF Ford, RAF Thorney Island and Gosport, all belonging to the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>or</b> Coastal Command. Included in the target selection was the radar station at Poling, West Sussex, near Littlehampton.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} contains 52chromosomes with a {{total of}} 58major arms (2n=52, FN=58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly acrocentric, having a long and a short <b>arm,</b> <b>or</b> telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The Y chromosome is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right <b>arm</b> <b>or</b> leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus <b>Arm</b> <b>or</b> Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the bright star Vega. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.|$|E
5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England {{was a way}} of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, <b>arm,</b> <b>or</b> waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E

5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, <b>arm,</b> <b>or</b> even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

25|$|Kinematics {{is used in}} {{astrophysics}} {{to describe}} the motion of celestial bodies and collections of such bodies.

25|$|Cash flow ARM {{mortgages}} are {{synonymous with}} option <b>ARM</b> <b>or</b> payment option ARM mortgages, however {{it should be}} noted that not all loans with cash flow options are adjustable.

25|$|Severe {{hypotension}} at {{presentation is}} a grave prognostic indicator. It is {{usually associated with}} pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the brachiocephalic artery (supplying the right <b>arm)</b> <b>or</b> the left subclavian artery (supplying the left arm).|$|E

Then they bite them on an <b>arm</b> <b>or</b> leg and snap on the victim's head, this being the most dangerous part of the attack.|$|E
25|$|The distaff {{was used}} for holding the bunch of wool, flax, or other fibres. It was a short stick, {{on one end of}} which was loosely wound the raw material.
