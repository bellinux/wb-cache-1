5|$|Following the tie to the Mark Greys, the Panhandles {{traveled}} to Lorain, Ohio, {{to play against}} the Elyria Athletics on Thanksgiving Day. The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E

The insurmountable debt rose and soon after the campaign there was a further arrangement to clear it.|$|E
25|$|Compared to many Welsh towns, Newport's {{economy had}} a broad base, with foundries, {{engineering}} works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire. However, the docks were in decline {{even before the}} Great Depression, and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> levels seen in the mining towns of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half {{the population in the}} 1920s and 30s. In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.|$|E
25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E

The road along the Tagus valley was a mere track through a rocky wilderness, with Castelo Branco being the only {{substantial}} town in the area. Amid the continual rain, the advance guard limped into Abrantes on 23 November. The rear of the corps closed up on 26 November. By this time, the only guns with the column were four Spanish horse artillery pieces, while half of the soldiers were straggling or marauding.|$|E
25|$|H5N1 {{may cause}} {{more than one}} {{influenza}} pandemic, as {{it is expected to}} continue mutating in birds regardless of whether humans develop herd immunity to a future pandemic strain. Influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future influenza pandemic is based on what can be done and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{country had}} been hit by a {{prolonged}} period of dry weather in the second half 2011, which had been attributed to the La Niña that results in the cooling of the surface temperature of the sea around Tuvalu which resulted in reduced rainfall. In October 2011, the Tuvalu Red Cross reported that the country had not received normal rainfall in six months, leading to shortages. The capital, Funafuti, and several of the outer atolls had been particularly affected by the drought. Nukulaelae and Nanumaga were the most seriously affected outer islands. The dry conditions on Nukulaelae affected the vast majority of pulaka pits - Pulaka, or swamp taro, is a staple crop for Tuvaluans. On Vaitupu the drought was also severe, but not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other islands.|$|E

25|$|The patrol bases were hurriedly created. One of {{the young}} lieutenants who flew from Marfa Field {{in the summer of}} 1919 remembered the flying field as a pasture at the eastern edge of town. Its five hangars were made from canvas. A double row of ten or twelve tents served as officer and enlisted {{quarters}} and sheltered flight headquarters and supply. The lieutenant, Stacy C. Hinkle, recalled his tour of duty on the border as “a life of hardship, possible death, starvation pay, and a lonely life without social contacts, in hot, barren desert wastes, tortured by sun, wind, and sand.” The boredom was <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> physical hardship and discomfort, the sole recreation being drinking and gambling. Even so, Hinkle thought the airmen better off than the poor fellows at cavalry outposts up and down the border.|$|E
25|$|After the 1976 season, {{most of the}} Athletics' veteran players {{did become}} {{eligible}} for free agency, and predictably almost all left. Several decades and 3,000 miles later, one of baseball's most storied franchises suffered yet another dismemberment of a dynasty team. As happened {{with the end of}} the A's first dynasty in the early 1900s, the collapse was swift and total. The next three years were <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> worst days in Philadelphia or Kansas City, with the A's finishing last twice and next-to-last once. In 1977, for instance—only three years after winning the World Series and two years after playing for the pennant—the A's finished with the worst record in the American League, and the second-worst record in baseball. They even trailed the expansion Seattle Mariners (though by only 1/2 game, as one game with the Minnesota Twins was canceled by weather and never made up).|$|E

PopMatters, however, praised Thriller 25 and the remix of [...] "The Girl Is Mine". They wrote, [...] "Any album good enough to make you forgive (although maybe not forget) a song <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' has got to be damn good." [...] They added that will.i.am had put a [...] "breezy spin" [...] on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} of the railway and pipeline had not been greatly affected by the fighting on 23 April and by 29 April, four trains a day were running regularly to the railhead, manned by No. 276 Railway Company, and the main line to Romani was opened on 19 May. A second standard gauge railway line from Romani to Mahamdiyah on the Mediterranean coast was completed by 9 June. But conditions on the ground were extreme; after the middle of May and in particular from mid June {{to the end of}} July, the heat in the Sinai Desert ranged from extreme to fierce when temperatures could be expected to be in the region of [...] in the shade.

Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time we got to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E
