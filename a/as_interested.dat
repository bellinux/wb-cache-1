Daley's successor, Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed Theresa E. Mintle, one of the Park Grill investors, as his $174,996-a-year chief of staff. Three days after Emanuel took office and Mintle started work as his top aide, Mintle transferred her financial stake in the restaurant to her husband.|$|E
5|$|Through Bar Sauma {{and other}} later envoys, such as Buscarello de Ghizolfi, Arghun promised the European leaders that if Jerusalem were conquered, {{he would have}} himself baptized and would return Jerusalem to the Christians. Bar Sauma was greeted warmly by the European monarchs, but Western Europe was no longer <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in the Crusades, and the mission to form an {{alliance}} was ultimately fruitless. England did respond by sending a representative, Geoffrey of Langley, {{who had been a}} member of Edward I's Crusade 20 years earlier, and was sent to the Mongol court as an ambassador in 1291.|$|E
5|$|Leicester possessed one of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of paintings in Elizabethan England, being the first great private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl's circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl's palatial town house, where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his Prothalamion, and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with his poem The Ruins of Time.|$|E

5|$|Rübel {{continued}} {{operating the}} ranch {{in the same}} manner as the Del Valles, employing many of same workers. He had served in the American Field Service during World War I and when World War II broke out, he volunteered for active duty again. He died while serving in Tunisia in 1943. After his death, his widow Mary married a man named Edwin Burger, who was not <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in maintaining the rancho. After Mary's death in 1968, Burger closed the ranch entirely. The buildings and grounds were left untended for years. Rübel's heirs regained control of the property after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which had damaged a number of buildings on the rancho.|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E

More recent research has revealed that British engineers and managers were <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> as in other countries. This disparity was largely due to what historians have been analysing: recent research has revealed that Taylor's practices diffused to Britain more through consultancies, in particular the Bedaux consultancy, than through institutions, as in Germany {{and to a lesser}} extent France, where a mixture was most effective.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of karma to causality {{is a central}} motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought. The theory of karma as causality holds that (1) executed actions of an individual affects {{the individual and the}} life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions {{do not have the same}} positive or negative karmic effect, <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.|$|E
25|$|However, {{aside from}} {{playing in a}} {{practice}} match, Azhar {{did not get a}} chance to participate in the World Cup and Pakistan's early exit from the tournament meant that he was once again, in line for being axed from the national squad. Following his exclusion, Azhar returned to playing county cricket in UK. Over the years, due to his constant exclusion from the Pakistani squad {{and the fact that he}} has crossed the 30-year-old mark, it seems that Mahmood is not <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in returning to the Pakistani line up as he once was. His weight gain, mediocre performances in ODIs, combined with the tough competition for the all rounder slot in the Pakistani line up meant that his chances for making a return to the national squad were very limited. He has previously signed with the defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL) and had been released from his central contract.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Lawrence {{returned}} to Britain {{to star in}} September Tide, a play written specifically for her by Daphne du Maurier. Her role {{was that of a}} middle-aged Cornish woman whose son-in-law, a bohemian artist, falls in love with her. The playwright had intended her to open the play on Broadway, but Lawrence's husband thought it was too British for the American market. The London press paid little attention to her return to the stage, and she was distressed to discover that in a country struggling to recover from the effects of World War II, the public no longer was <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in the private lives of stage stars as it once had been. Prior to opening in the West End, the play toured Blackpool, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester, where the frequently sparse audiences consisted primarily of elderly people who remembered Lawrence from her heyday. While on the road, she underwent erratic mood swings and frequently clashed with her fellow cast members, including actors Michael Gough and Bryan Forbes, and the crew. The play opened in London in mid-December 1948.|$|E

25|$|Hoffman was 52 at {{the time}} of his death on April 12, 1989, which was caused by {{swallowing}} 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. At the time he had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at the age of 90). Some close to Hoffman, including his longtime friend David Denton and fellow Chicago Seven co-defendant Tom Hayden, claimed that as a natural prankster who valued youth, he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the ideas of the 1960s had given way to a conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984 he had expressed dismay that the current generation of young people were not <b>as</b> <b>interested</b> in protesting and social activism as youth had been during the 1960s. Hoffman's body was found in his apartment in a converted turkey coop on Sugan Road in Solebury Township, near New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by about 200 pages of his own handwritten notes, many about his own moods.|$|E

In particular, he rejected a tag of being [...] "a male Carole King". [...] "With all due respect," [...] he later stated, [...] "I took no comfort in merely being labeled a 'singer / songwriter'."
