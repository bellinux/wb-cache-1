To evaluate the possibility to use a nonvolatile electrolyte for CE, the effect of sodium phosphate and <b>ammonium</b> <b>borate</b> on the MS signal of the proteins insulin, myoglobin, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated by employing infusion experiments, and compared {{to the effect of}} ammonium formate and formic acid. The study shows that with formic acid (50 mM, pH 2. 4) the most intense protein signals were obtained, while the use of sodium phosphate buffer (5 and 10 mM, pH 7. 5) almost completely diminished the MS response. Ammonium formate and <b>ammonium</b> <b>borate</b> (up to 100 mM, pH 8. 5) also caused protein ion suppression, but especially with the borate buffer significant MS intensity remained. MS analysis of myoglobin revealed the loss of the heme group when an acidic CE electrolyte was used. Using a background electrolyte containing 25 mM <b>ammonium</b> <b>borate</b> (pH 8. 5), it is demonstrated that a CE separation of a protein test mixture can be monitored with ESI-MS without degrading the MS performance allowing molecular weight determinations of the separated compounds. In the presence of borate, detection limits were estimated to be 5 - 10 μM (ca. 100 fmol injected). The usefulness of the CE-MS system employing a borate buffer is indicated by the analysis of a stored sample of BSA revealing several degradation products. A sample of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), a potential therapeutic agent, was also analyzed by CE-MS indicating the presence of a protein impurity.

Special attention is given to synthesis and reactivity of novel metal free catalytic systems based on bulky Lewis acids and bulky Lewis bases known as frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). N/B, C/B and P/B pairs previously identified as active catalyst are described together with the available mechanistic studies developed to clarify experimental findings obtained hitherto. In the experimental section, synthesis of the Lewis acid mono(perfluorophenyl) borane was studied thorough several routes obtaining the borane in almost quantitative yield {{as a series of}} dimers including the anti- and syn-isomer with a low percentage of bis(perfluorophenyl) borane. Hydrogen activation was not possible because dimerization avoided further reactivity of the boron center in the presence of bulky amines. A new synthetic route to obtain C 6 F 5 BCl 2 in 58 % yield was proposed and Lewis acid reactivity of the dichloro(perfluorophenyl) borane was studied with bulky amines exhibiting frustration although no hydrogen activation was achieved when purging hydrogen into the FLP solution.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we report the {{development}} of biaryl azepinium salts (e. g. 83, Figure i) and their application in the enantioselective epoxidation of tri-substituted alkenes. These iminium salts appear to exist as a mixture of two conformers at room temperature. The observed enantiocontrol in the epoxidation reactions investigated appears to result from the chiral amine biasing the reactivity of one biaryl azepine conformation over the other towards attack of a nucleophilic oxidant. This leads to the epoxidation proceeding preferentially via one diastereoisomer of the oxaziridinium intermediate. t-Bu t-Bu Figure i. We also report {{the development of}} biaryl azepinium salts (e. g. 112, Figure ii) and their application in the highly enantioselective alkylation and Michael addition of glycine imines.

Azepines (+) - 155 and (+) - 185, act as chiral relays and switch their conformation on removal of the trifluoroacetamide protecting group.

40|$|This study {{describes}} various {{strategies to}} improve the sensitivity of carbohydrate analysis in capillary electrophoresis (CE). The use of pH stacking is investigated in conjunction with 5 -aminofluorescein as a derivatisation agent for the sensitive analysis of simple sugars such as glucose, lactose and maltotriose by CE. The derivatisation agent was {{selected on the basis}} of its extremely high molar absorptivity, its compatibility with a 488 nm light-emitting diode (LED) and the fact that it has two ionisable groups making it compatible with on-line stacking using a dynamic pH junction. The influence of both acetic and formic acids were investigated with regard to both derivatisation efficiency and the ability to stack using a dynamic pH junction. Superior sensitivity and resolution was obtained in formic acid over acetic acid. Simulation studies combined with experimental data showed the separation with the best resolution and greatest sensitivity when the carbohydrates were derivatised with the 95 mM formic acid. Using this method efficiencies of 150, 000 plates and detection limits at 8. 5 x 10 ⁻⁸ M for mono-, di- and tri-saccharides were achieved. The current system demonstrates a 515 times improvement factoring sensitivity when compared to using a normal deuterium (D₂) lamp, and 16 times improvement over other systems using lightemitting diodes (LEDs). A novel fluorescent tag, 0 - 2 -[aminoethyl]fluorescein, was developed for the separation of sugars by CE with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection using an argon ion laser. The tag was synthesised using three consecutive steps namely: esterification, alkylation and hydrolysis, specifically designed to offer a flexible way in which to make an assortment of fluorescent tags from cheap and readily available starting reagents (typically less than 1 per g of fluorescent tag). 0 - 2 -[Aminoethyl]fluorescein was equipped with a spacer group to lower steric effects between the fluorescein backbone and the reducing end of the carbohydrate which were anticipated {{to improve the}} reactivity of the tag. Fluorescence studies of the novel tag revealed a quantum yield (QY) of 0. 24, when using fluorescein as a standard. Kinetic studies were also conducted to compare and assess the performance of aromatic and aliphatic amines using the novel tag and two commercial fluorescent fluorescein motifs where the aromatic amine derivative demonstrated better labelling performance. The separation performance of all the tags was also benchmarked using a range of corn syrup oligosaccharides. The application of the novel tag to a set of oligosaccharides produced a baseline separation of seven different sugar units, with 1 nM detection limit for maltoheptaose. A CE method was designed with on-line concentration which can be translated directly to a microchip format allowing preconcentration via dynamic pH junction. Optimisation of the separation selectivity yielded best separations using a 170 mM <b>ammonium</b> <b>borate</b> buffer at pH 8. 60 in an acrylamide coated capillary. When using the current system via LIP, limits of detection (LODs) as low as 0. 13 nM for maltose were obtained, which were 10 times lower than could be achieved without on-line concentration. In order to implement this system in a glass/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchip, the low pH sample was introduced into the microchannels via a cathodic pH independent electro-osmotic flow (EOF) generated using a polyelectrolyte multilayer coating. Microchip separations of maltose, glucose, galactose and allose with dynamic pH junction, were achieved within 120 s, with the limit of detection (LOD) of maltose using a light-emitting diode induced fluorescence (LEDIF) detection system being 790 nM.

The flow-through was collected and stored at − 30  °C until labeling. The AccQ•Tag Ultra Derivatization Kit (Nihon Waters K. K., Tokyo, Japan) was used for derivatization of free amino acids and <b>ammonium.</b> AccQ•Tag Ultra <b>Borate</b> Buffer (30  μl) and the Amino Acids Mixture Standard Solution, Type H (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) or extracted sample (10  μl) were vortexed briefly, and AccQ•Tag Reagent (10  μl) was added and vortexed again for 10  s. After a 1  min incubation at room temperature, samples were heated in a block incubator for 10  min at 55  °C. AccQ•Tag labeled samples were kept at room temperature and measured with ACQUITY UPLC H-Class (Nihon Waters K. K.).|$|R
