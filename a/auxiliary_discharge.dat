40|$|A novel {{scheme that}} employs {{the use of}} an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>discharge</b> has been shown to reduce {{markedly}} anode sheath potentials in a transverse discharge. An 8. 8 A low-pressure argon discharge {{in the presence of a}} transverse magnetic field was used as the plasma source in this study. In such discharges, the transverse flux that is collected by the anode is severely limited due to marked reductions in the transverse diffusion coefficient. Findings of this study indicate that the local electron number density and the transverse flux increase when the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>discharge</b> is operated. Changes in these parameters are reflected in the measured anode sheath voltage. Anode sheath potentials, estimated by using Langmuir probes, were shown to be reduced by over 33 % when the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>discharge</b> is operated. These reductions in anode sheath potentials translated into significant reductions in anode power flux as measured using water calorimeter techniques. The reductions in anode power flux also correlate well with changes in the electron transverse flux. Finally, techniques implementing these positive effects in real plasma accelerators are discussed...|$|E

Therefore, the German Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) and the German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW) together with the responsible German Water and Shipping Authority (WSV) address research questions in a R 2 ̆ 6 D program, focusing on the link between hydraulics and fish behavior.

The essence of the method is that the thyratron grid and the hollow cathode of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>discharge</b> has to be grounded and the trigger pulse is applied to the ring anode of the trigger unit. In the proposed method, an undesirable high-voltage spike at the thyratron grid, which can appear with a usage of the other methods of triggering, is absent. It is shown that to trigger the thyratron a critical pulsed current to the main cathode cavity at a level of 0. 8 A and higher should be provided. When the current exceeds the critical value, the jitter in the delay time to triggering falls in a range of 10 ns.

It was done by first starting a sliding spark between the cathode and an auxiliary electrode near the cathode by applying a voltage pulse of 200 ns duration and then applying the main voltage pulse of 3 μs. The spatial and temporal growth of the discharge were studied by observing 8 mm microwave interferograms at three points {{along the length of}} the discharge tube and by photographing the discharge. It was found that in hydrogen the time delay τ between the application of the main voltage and the starting of the discharge current remained nearly constant at p< 10 ^- 4 torr and then it decreased with increasing p. Similar results were obtained when the tube was filled with helium and neon. The photographs of the discharge showed some instability in the plasma; but when a magnetic field of 2 kG was applied the instabilities decreased noticeably.

Iodine dissociation fraction generated in the side discharge and measured in the laser cavity is up to 50 %. However, the experiments showed that additional iodine dissociation generated in the side discharge only moderately increases laser gain, by 10 - 15 %. Parametric gain optimization by varying main discharge pressure, O 2 and NO fractions in the flow, I 2 flow rate, pulsed discharge frequency, and sustainer discharge power, with the side discharge in operation produces gain up to 0. 08 %/cm. Two parameters that critically affect gain are the energy loading per molecule in the discharge and the NO flow rate controlling the O atom concentration in the flow. In particular, operation at the main discharge pressure of 60 torr results in significantly higher gain than at 100 torr, 0. 080 %/cm vs. 0. 043 %/cm, due to high discharge energy loading per molecule at the lower pressure.

40|$|Abstract: Adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>discharge</b> to the outflow of the fishway {{extends the}} {{attraction}} flow {{further into the}} tailwater and serves to guide fish to the entrance. Due to conflicting interests between ecological demands and hydropower generation this additional discharge is subject to critical scrutiny. How much auxiliary water is needed for a certain effect? Suggestions about the necessary discharge vary and only {{few studies have been}} conducted so far. The German Federal Institute of Hydrology and the German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute will address this question at four pilot sites in German waterways as part of a research program on ecological continuity. However, developing a study design is not an easy task: Which is the best explanatory variable to investigate - a certain amount of discharge (which is easier to control) or a distinct flow pattern in the tailwater (which is more likely what fish will notice) ? Is the total number of fish that find the fishway a good response variable? Where and how should we count the fish? How do we deal with the multitude of environmental parameters that also influence the number of migrating fish? Which sample size will suffice and what level of probability can be considered adequate? To deal with these questions we have worked out a study design that includes several statistical approaches (blocked design, baseline measurement, regression techniques). We have developed discharge scenarios on the basis of CFD and used 2012 - 2013 monitoring data from a Vaki-Counter at the River Moselle to simulate effects and necessary sample sizes. We also used this data to find out which environmental parameters influence the number of migrating fish and may thus influence our studies.

40|$|Monitoring optical {{emission}} {{has become}} avaluable {{tool for the}} plasma processing of semiconductor materials. We have extended this technique by monitoring atomic emission from etch products excited in an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>discharge</b> located own-stream of the plasma processing region. In this configuration, process monitoring can be achieved {{even in the absence}} of a reactive plasma; and emission intensities are independent of the plasma Characteristics in the process discharge. The method is applied to the determination f the absolute tch rate of silicon by atomic fluorine. Changes in the intensity of optical emission from re-actants (1) and etch products (2 - 5) in plasma reac-tors are valuable for process end-point detection. Al-though these absolute intensities reflect the process chemistry and aid in its optimization, %hey are diffi-cult to relate to quantitative etch rates because mis-sion from excited states is a complex function Of the plasma composition and the electrical gas discharge parameters. Thus, it would be extremely useful to employ a monitoring system in which the relationship between intensity and etch ra te is simple in form. Clearly, the monitoring of products rather than etch-ing species would be most useful, since one requires no detailed chemical information to relate emission from product to the etch rate. Ideally, the monitoring system should also be applicable to Simple gas-solid reactors (no-plasma) as well, since recent I I I-V etch-ing studies (6) have demonstrated that feature morph-ology and anisotropy can be controlled by a combina-tion of plasma etching and etching with undissociated molecular halogens. Mass spectrometry offers some of these characteris-tics; however, the instrumentation is often complex, expensive, and insensitive when the partial pressure of product species is low. We describe a product moni-toring technique based on optical emission excited downstream of the reactor, which shows promise of satisfying all the criteria.

Although irregular, these payments (each worth 75 denarii to a common legionary) averaged once every 7.5 years in the early 1st century and every three years later.

A very valuable benefit paid to legionaries was the discharge bonus (praemia) paid on completion of the full 25 years' service.

Striation spacing, frequency and velocity were measured as a function of discharge current from low currents to the current for extinction of moving striations, for pressures from 1 to 16 mm Hg. Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an <b>auxiliary</b> anode <b>discharge,</b> which brought the positive column in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing anode fall in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the positive column were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous positive column in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes. This leads to the con­clusion that striations are due to an inherent instability of the positive column, and not to the effects developed by the anode or cathode.

For O{sub 3 }:NO ratios greater than unity a chain of reactions successively produce NO{sub 2 }, NO{sub 3 }, and N{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } which then combines with ambient H{sub 2 }O to form HNO{sub 3 }. The overall efficiency is dominated by the electrical efficiency of the ozonizer, at present about 30 eV/O{sub 3 } within the discharge...|$|R
40|$|A dc {{discharge}} (see Fig. 1) with a {{hot cathode}} (1) and bounded by the wall (2) {{may be subject to}} current and voltage plasma oscillations, which may then have deleterious effects on its operation. These oscillations can be inhibited by installing an auxiliary electrode (4), placed outside of the anode (3). By collecting a modest current through a small opening in the anode, the discharge can be stablized. This method of supressing current oscillations can be used, for example, for high current stabilizers. Typical experimental current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the cathode-anode gap are shown in Fig. 2 for discharges in helium. Curves 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the case without collection of the current by the <b>auxiliary</b> electrode. The <b>discharge</b> has a positive differential resistance for a pressure of 0. 6 Torr (curve 1). Increasing the gas pressure to 1 Torr leads to transformation of the discharge differential resistance to being slightly negative (curve 2). Further increase of the gas pressure yield...|$|R
40|$|The {{confinement}} of <b>auxiliary</b> heated NSTX <b>discharges</b> is discussed. The energy {{confinement time}} in plasmas with either L-mode or H-mode edges is enhanced over the values {{given by the}} ITER 97 L and ITER 98 Pby(2) scalings, being up to 2 - 3 times L-mode and 1. 5 times H-mode. TRANSP calculations based on the kinetic profile measurements reproduce the magnetics-based determination of stored energy and the measured neutron production rate. Power balance calculations reveal that, in a high power neutral beam heated H-mode discharge, the ion thermal transport is near neoclassical levels, and well below the electron thermal transport, which is the main loss channel. Perturbative impurity injection techniques indicate the particle diffusivity to be slightly above the neoclassical level in discharges with L-mode edge. High-harmonic fast-wave (HHFW) bulk electron heating is described and thermal transport is discussed. Thermal ion transport {{is found to be}} above neoclassical level, but thermal electron transport remains the main loss mechanism. Evidences of an electron thermal internal transport barrier obtained with HHFW heating are presented. A description of H-mode discharges obtained during HHFW heating is presented...|$|R
40|$|A new {{application}} of the sputtering rate measurement is given in this paper. In fact, by measuring the sputtering rate of different materials fixed on the radio frequency (r. f.) biased electrode, {{it is possible to}} determine easily ion flux that falls onto this biased electrode. This study is realized in a low pressure (0. 4 Pa) argon planar r. f. discharge system (13. 56  MHz). This sputtering method is interesting to have informations about the deposition process in physical vapour deposition. In order to demonstrate the validity of this method, experiments have been carried out in two reactors, each one with different geometrical parameters and the results obtained have been compared and confirmed using the Child-Langmuir law. The ion flux increases {{as a function of the}} incident r. f power (0 – 300  W). The values obtained range from 1018 to 1019 ions m- 2  s- 1. These results in an argon plasma are applied to estimate incident ion flux in a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, we show that it is possible to evaluate the incident ion flux by measuring the sputtering rate when the plasma is densified using either an <b>auxiliary</b> hot cathode <b>discharge</b> or an additional magnetic field. These experimental cases correspond respectively to r. f. triode ion plating or r. f. magnetron sputtering. ...|$|R
