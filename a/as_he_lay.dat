5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E

5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays.

5|$|Taylor v. Beckham, , {{was a case}} {{heard before}} the Supreme Court of the United States on April 30 and May 1, 1900, to decide {{the outcome of the}} disputed Kentucky gubernatorial {{election}} of 1899. The litigants were Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor and Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham. In the November 7, 1899, election, Taylor received 193,714 votes to Democrat William Goebel's 191,331. This result was certified by a 2–1decision of the state's Board of Elections. Goebel challenged the election results on the basis of alleged voting irregularities, and the Democrat-controlled Kentucky General Assembly formed a committee to investigate Goebel's claims. Goebel was shot on January 30, 1900, one day before the General Assembly approved the committee's report declaring enough Taylor votes invalid to swing the election to Goebel. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> dying of his wounds, Goebel was sworn into office on January 31, 1900. He died on February 3, 1900, and Beckham ascended to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E

25|$|The painting, though widely celebrated, {{has also}} been heavily criticized in its {{historically}} inaccurate portrayal of Wolfe’s death itself.
