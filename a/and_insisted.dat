5|$|During his lifetime, Morris {{produced}} {{items in}} a range of crafts, mainly those to do with furnishing, including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> on the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> on learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.|$|E
5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|After {{going through}} the script, JAR Pictures' Ajay G. Rai decided to produce the film, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> on Iyer to direct it as well. Although {{initially}} reluctant, Iyer agreed to direct and learnt the major aspects of cinematography {{as a part of}} her preparation. Gavemic U Ary worked as the cinematographer for the film, and Kunal Sharma headed the sound department. The visual effects were provided by Prasad Film Labs, a motion picture post-production studio based in Hyderabad, and the costumes were designed by Sachin Lovalekar.|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them. The Bendix Corporation issued denials, {{stating that the}} units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced.|$|E
5|$|Dyer {{took his}} role as a {{physical}} culture expert very seriously <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> on managing the diet of his boxers. He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid-1920s which was based on a diet of fruit and vegetable drinks, a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses. Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert into the next decade and was still working out of London in that capacity in 1939.|$|E

5|$|His earlier {{insistence on}} not filming with live {{ammunition}} {{proved to be}} a good decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 and 1885, {{through the}} {{influence}} of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of art for art's sake, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that all great art must be didactic.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} pain in his throat that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E

5|$|Kent {{attended}} St. Philip Catholic Central High School in Battle Creek, Michigan. He {{was recruited}} by the Boston Red Sox as a catcher right out of high school. Kent’s father thought that Kent {{was too young to}} play professional baseball <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that he go to St. Benedict’s College in Kansas. After graduating, Kent worked at a Veterans Administration Medical Center in his hometown of Battle Creek while being trained by Leapin’ Larry Chene for a professional wrestling career.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1993, Saint Joseph Academy {{high school}} senior Joey Fischer was shot dead outside his home in Rancho Viejo, an upscale {{community}} north of Brownsville, Texas. Dora Cisneros, {{the mother of his}} ex-girlfriend, was responsible for orchestrating Fischer's murder after he broke up with her daughter Cristina. Fischer and Cristina had broken up the previous summer, but Cisneros became obsessed with their relationship <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that Fischer date her daughter again. After he refused a US$500 offer from Cisneros, she consulted María Mercedes Martínez, a fortune teller, to cast a spell on him.|$|E
5|$|Roekiah {{insisted on}} {{becoming}} an actress, despite {{the opposition of}} her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with one condition: Roekiah could only perform once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took to {{the stage for the}} first time, Mohammad Ali– unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter– rushed on stage <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented. Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with the troupe.|$|E

5|$|Stuart {{carried on}} his captain duties for the 2008–09 season. In February 2008, he {{pleaded not guilty}} to the charges of grievous bodily harm to Chris Beardsley. He went on trial on 2 September 2008, denying the {{allegations}} of intent <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> it was an accident, trying to release himself of Beardsley's hold. On 5 September 2008, the jury acquitted Stuart of the charges causing Beardsley grievous bodily harm.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite carabinier brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> on their involvement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Before the final, both finalists {{were awarded}} 12,000 tickets. The Danish Football Association {{announced}} that 9,000 tickets would be offered, {{for sale to}} the public, while the remaining 3,000 were sold to other European countries. UEFA allocated another 3,000 tickets to their officials and VIP members. Problems ensued after {{it was revealed that}} Galatasaray had been charging the tickets more than the original price, in order to prevent some football hooligans from entering the ground. The Turkish club's secretary general however, denied this <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> that the tickets were being sold at their original price and to support the stadium and the club's other sporting activities.|$|E
