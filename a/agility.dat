5|$|A very agile mutant and henchman of Magneto. His powers {{include a}} prehensile tongue, a slimy {{substance}} that he spits onto others, and enhanced <b>agility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog <b>agility.</b> It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. <b>Agility</b> has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Exmoors {{were used}} as pit ponies. Ponies not kept in semi-feral {{conditions}} are used {{for a variety of}} activities including showing, long-distance riding, driving, and <b>agility.</b> Exmoor ponies won both divisions at the International Horse <b>Agility</b> Championships in 2011, and took a third title at the 2012 Championships. The breed's hardiness makes it suitable for conservation grazing, and it contributes to the management of many heathland, chalk grassland and other natural pasture habitats, {{as well as to the}} conservation of Exmoor itself.|$|E
5|$|The Opifex {{follows a}} {{traditional}} thief/rogue archetype and possess poor stamina and psychic but high <b>agility</b> and sense.|$|E
5|$|A mutant {{and expert}} tracker with super <b>agility,</b> reflexes, acute senses and {{enhanced}} strength. In {{preparation for the}} role, Stewart gained 50 pounds and grew his hair much longer than its usual length.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, obedience and <b>agility</b> and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When a gauge fills, the player {{can make a}} move, such as attacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. The speed at which the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's <b>agility</b> attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's <b>agility</b> attribute, the player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Swifts {{spend most}} of their time in flight. Few birds have the {{necessary}} speed and <b>agility</b> to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently inaccessible to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 2048 is {{a racing}} game which {{involves}} players piloting anti-gravity ships {{through a variety}} of scenarios. Set primarily in the year 2048, it is a prequel to the first instalment of the Wipeout series; dedicated race tracks have not yet been built, and races are held on city streets. The single-player game progresses through the first three years, 2048, 2049, and 2050, of the AGRC (Anti-Gravity Racing Championships). The game has four types of ships: speed ships, <b>agility</b> ships, fighters and prototypes. Speed ships (lightweight, Formula 1-like vehicles which emphasise acceleration and momentum) are primarily used for speed-oriented races, such as time trials. <b>Agility</b> ships, similar to rally cars, have increased manoeuvrability and handling; fighter ships are heavily armoured craft which sacrifice speed for combat power.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with <b>agility,</b> but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great <b>agility.</b> The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{played the}} power forward position, but {{occasionally}} played small forward and center. He {{was known for}} his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and <b>agility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born {{into poverty}} in Iowa, Sunday spent some {{years at the}} Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home before working at odd jobs and playing for local running and {{baseball}} teams. His speed and <b>agility</b> provided {{him the opportunity to}} play baseball in the major leagues for eight years, where he was an average hitter and a good fielder known for his base-running.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and <b>agility.</b> He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily.|$|E
5|$|In the field, the AWS is less exuberant {{than the}} English Springer Spaniel, {{but it is}} as skilled in {{retrieval}} as Labrador or Golden Retriever. It is versatile regardless {{of the type of}} terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed is also good at <b>agility</b> and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Liz {{is worried}} when she smells maple syrup in her {{apartment}} and Jack tells her {{that it could be}} the chemical agent Northrax. She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps in his apartment and she has seen him and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an <b>agility</b> course in the park. Liz is shocked to discover that the pair are auditioning for The Amazing Race and, in fact, not terrorists.|$|E
5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and <b>agility,</b> but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|Numerically {{controlled}} oscillators offer {{several advantages}} over {{other types of}} oscillators in terms of <b>agility,</b> accuracy, stability and reliability. NCOs are used in many communications systems including digital up/down converters used in 3G wireless and software radio systems, digital PLLs, radar systems, drivers for optical or acoustic transmissions, and multilevel FSK/PSK modulators/demodulators.|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and <b>agility</b> to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|E
5|$|The Cattle Dog breed {{standard}} {{states that it}} should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the <b>agility</b> and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{is a popular}} species for game shooting because of its speed, <b>agility,</b> and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} morph the dragon {{to change its}} attack, defense, <b>agility</b> and spiritual {{attribute}}s. Boosting one attribute diminishes another; for example, boosting the attack attribute reduces the spiritual attribute, meaning berserks require more BP, while boosting means gauges fill faster {{at the expense of}} defense. Certain berserks are only available in certain dragon configurations.|$|E
5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels {{and they have}} no {{undercoat}} like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or <b>agility</b> work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of light cavalry, the stamina and <b>agility</b> of horses with Arabian blood gave an {{enormous}} military advantage to any army who possessed them. As a result, many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments that crossed Arabians on local stock, one example being Knyszyna, the royal stud of Polish king Zygmunt II August, and another the Imperial Russian Stud of Peter the Great.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and <b>agility</b> to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E
5|$|Gale Eugene Sayers (born May 30, 1943) is {{a former}} {{professional}} American football player who earned acclaim both as a halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In a brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. He {{was known for his}} elusiveness and <b>agility,</b> and was regarded by his peers {{as one of the most}} difficult players to tackle.|$|E
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, <b>agility</b> and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and <b>agility.</b> This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, <b>agility,</b> alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the <b>agility</b> of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog <b>agility,</b> herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of <b>agility</b> and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog <b>agility</b> and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or <b>agility</b> and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an {{interceptor}} {{variant of}} the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior <b>agility</b> to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, {{but it was not}} intended as a dog-fighter, instead it was a long-endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe.|$|E
5|$|The breed gained {{official}} {{recognition from}} the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 {{after five years}} of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and <b>agility</b> competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and <b>agility.</b> Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
