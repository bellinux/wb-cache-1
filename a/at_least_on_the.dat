5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.

5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E

5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} British colonies, Singapore {{acquired}} a legal system and law modelled after Britain.

The colonial legal system criminalised sodomy (see section 377 of the Singapore Penal Code). These laws reinforced the values of the ruling British elite, which set the tone for other classes and ethnicities to emulate, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface. Over time, and to appear equally 'civilised' many Asians disavowed their longstanding cultural tolerance of sexual minorities.|$|E

25|$|The HS1 {{line was}} {{finished}} {{on time and}} under budget. The reduction in journey times and increase in reliability achieved through the opening of Section 1 enabled Eurostar to capture 71% of the total London–Paris market and over 80% of the leisure market and Section 2 has increased these figures further. Additionally, the connections provided to the WCML, MML and ECML by Section 2 may see growth of hitherto marginal markets, by finally allowing Regional Eurostars to operate, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electrified ECML and WCML. Eurostar's chief executive stated that the company believes it can take 50% market share even on 4½-hour journeys, a journey time that would put Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds within reach of mainland Europe.|$|E
25|$|Regarding Sophoniba, {{her story}} {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia). Her story also sheds light {{on the relationship between}} Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC–AD 17), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. Such details may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions of what might have happened.|$|E

25|$|Another {{financial}} drain was the Pro Spectacular concept. The 1985 edition was {{a revival}} of a similar experiment abandoned in 1980 after bad financial losses. It was noted {{at the time that}} Professional BMX in particular and BMX as a whole was not a mature enough sport for the concept to be a success. In 1984 the ABA felt its time had come. As noted, by 1984 there was a perceptible drop in the popularity in BMX racing, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local level. The slight dip in sales BMX bicycles built for racing was out stripped by the explosive growth in BMX freestyle bicycles. Track operators all so noticed a decline in new entrances in the beginner’s class at local tracks. The unsponsored beginner, novice and intermediate classes are the bread and butter of local races. Indeed, the unsponsored amateur, even in the expert classes are the vast majority in any sanctioning body. Any drop in the influx of new riders at the local level is a clear bellwether of trouble. A way must be had to generate and spread knowledge of BMX to the general public and draw more youngsters into the sport-and repair the very bad Pro-ABA relations.|$|E

Pterosaur pycnofibers were structured similarly to theropod proto-feathers.
