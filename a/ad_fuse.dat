40|$|Kidney anion {{exchanger}} adaptor protein (Kanadaptin) is a protein which {{interacts with the}} cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of kidney {{anion exchanger}} 1 (kAE 1) and was first detected in mice using the yeast two-hybrid system and was also found to co-localize with kAE 1 in rabbit a-intercalated cells. Impaired trafficking of human kAE 1 can result in the kidney disease-distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), and defective interaction between human kAE 1 and kanadaptin may cause this trafficking impairment and {{be the basis for}} dRTA pathogenesis. However, it is unknown whether kAE 1 can really interact with kanadaptin in humans. We have thus investigated the interaction between human kAE 1 and human kanadaptin by using both Gal 4 and LexA yeast two-hybrid systems. It was found that co-expression of Gal 4 DBD fused to the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of kAE 1 and Gal 4 <b>AD</b> <b>fused</b> to kanadaptin could not activate the transcription of the ADE 2, HIS 3 and lacZ reporters in the Gal 4 system. A similar result was obtained for the interaction between B 42 <b>AD</b> <b>fused</b> to the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of kAE 1 and LexA fused to kanadaptin in activation of lacZ transcription in the LexA system. The absence of interaction between the fusion proteins in both yeast two-hybrid systems raises the possibility that kAE 1 may not interact with kanadaptin in human cells. Considerably different structures of both kAE 1 and kanadaptin in mice and humans may lead to different binding properties of the proteins in these two species...|$|R

50|$|Immunoelectrophoresis is {{a general}} name {{for a number of}} {{biochemical}} methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized. The methods were developed and used extensively {{during the second half of}} the 20th century. In somewhat chronological order: Immunoelectrophoretic analysis (one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Grabar), crossed immunoelectrophoresis (two-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell), rocket-immunoelectrophoresis (one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis <b>ad</b> modum Laurell), <b>fused</b> rocket immunoelectrophoresis <b>ad</b> modum Svendsen and Harboe, affinity immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Bøg-Hansen.|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's Diasese (AD) {{diagnosis}} can {{be carried}} out by analysing functional or structural changes in the brain. Functional changes associated to neurological disorders can be figured out by positron emission tomography (PET) as it allows to study the activation of certain areas of the brain during specific task development. On the other hand, neurological disorders can also be discovered by analysing structural changes in the brain which are usually assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In fact, computer-aided diagnosis tools (CAD) that have been recently devised for the diagnosis of neurological disorders use functional or structural data. However, functional and structural data can be fused out in order to improve the accuracy and to diminish the false positive rate in CAD tools. In this paper we present a method for the diagnosis of <b>AD</b> which <b>fuses</b> multimodal image (PET and MRI) data by combining Sparse Representation Classifiers (SRC).

40|$|Abstract Background Eukaryotic {{transcription}} activators normally {{consist of}} a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a transcription activation domain (AD). While many sequence patterns and motifs have been defined for DBDs, ADs do not share easily recognizable motifs or structures. Results We report herein that the N-terminal domain of yeast valyl-tRNA synthetase can function as an <b>AD</b> when <b>fused</b> to a DNA-binding protein, LexA, and turn on reporter genes with distinct LexA-responsive promoters. The transcriptional activity was mainly attributed to a five-residue peptide, WYDWW, near the C-terminus of the N domain. Remarkably, the pentapeptide per se retained much of the transcriptional activity. Mutations which substituted tryptophan residues for both of the non-tryptophan residues in the pentapeptide (resulting in W 5) significantly enhanced its activity (~ 1. 8 -fold), while mutations which substituted aromatic residues with alanine residues severely impaired its activity. Accordingly, a much more active peptide, pentatryptophan (W 7), was produced, which elicited ~ 3 -fold higher activity {{than that of the}} native pentapeptide and the N domain. Further study indicated that W 7 mediates transcription activation through interacting with the general transcription factor, TFIIB. Conclusions Since W 7 shares no sequence homology or features with any known transcription activators, it may represent a novel class of AD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Expression of {{recombinant}} {{proteins in}} Escherichia coli {{often leads to}} formation of inclusion bodies (IB). If a recombinant protein contains one or more disulfide bonds, protein refolding and thiol oxidation reactions are required to recover its biological activity. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} molecular chaperones and foldases assist with the in vitro protein refolding. However, their use has been limited by the stoichiometric amount required for the refolding reaction. In search of alternatives to facilitate the use of these folding biocatalysts in this study, DsbA, DsbC, and the apical domain of GroEL (<b>AD)</b> were <b>fused</b> to the carbohydrate-binding module CBD Cex of Cellulomonas fimi. The recombinant proteins were purified and immobilized in cellulose and used to assist the oxidative refolding of denatured and reduced lysozyme. The assisted refolding yields obtained with immobilized folding biocatalysts were at least twice of those obtained in the spontaneous refolding, suggesting that the AD, DsbA, and DsbC immobilized in cellulose might be useful for the oxidative refolding of recombinant proteins that are expressed as inclusion bodies. In addition, the spontaneous or assisted refolding kinetics data fitted well (r 2 > 0. 9) to a previously reported lysozyme refolding model. The estimated refolding (kN) and aggregation (kA) constants were consistent with the hypothesis that foldases assisted the oxidative refolding of lysozyme by decreasing protein aggregation rather than increasing the refolding rate.

40|$|Cecropin AD, a {{chimeric}} antimicrobial peptide {{obtained from}} cecropins, is effective at killing specific microorganisms. However, a highly efficient expression system is {{still needed to}} allow for commercial application of cecropin AD. For the exogenous expression of cecropin <b>AD,</b> we <b>fused</b> the cecropin <b>AD</b> gene with a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) gene and a signal peptide of SacB, while a Bacillus subtilis expression system was constructed based on Bacillus subtilis cells genetically modified {{by the introduction of}} an operon including an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) -inducible Spac promoter, a signal peptide of amyQ, and the SUMO protease gene. The recombinant cecropin AD was expressed, and 30. 6 mg of pure recombinant protein was purified from 1 liter of culture supernatant. The purified cecropin AD displayed antimicrobial activity against some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and was especially effective toward Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of < 0. 05 μM (0. 2 μg/ml). Stability analysis results showed that the activity of cecropin AD was not influenced by temperatures as high as 55 °C for 20 min; however, temperatures above 85 °C (for 20 min) decreased the antimicrobial activity of cecropin AD. Varying the pH from 4. 0 to 9. 0 did not appear to affect the activity of cecropin AD, but some loss of potency was observed at pH values lower than pH 4. 0. Under the challenge of several proteases (proteinase K, trypsin, and pepsin), cecropin AD maintained functional activity. The results indicated that the recombinant product expressed by the designed Bacillus subtilis expression system was a potent antimicrobial agent and could be applied to control infectious diseases of farm animals or even humans...|$|R
25|$|Plasmids are {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is {{engineered to}} produce a protein product in which the activation domain (<b>AD)</b> fragment is <b>fused</b> onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may {{be referred to as}} the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein <b>fused</b> to the <b>AD</b> may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method. This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the accuracy and added diagnostic value of 3 -dimensional (3 D) image fusion of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) and functional cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for assessing hemodynamically relevant {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD). Methods: Twenty-seven patients with significant coronary stenoses on prospectively electrocardiography-gated dual-source CTCA, confirmed by catheter angiography and perfusion defects on CMR at 1. 5 T were included. Surface representations and volume-rendered images from 3 D-fused CTCA/ CMR data were generated using a software prototype. Fusion accuracy was evaluated by calculating surface distances of blood pools and Dice similarity coefficients. Two independent, blinded readers assigned myocardial defects to culprit coronary arteries with side-by side analysis of CTCA and CMR and using <b>fused</b> CTCA/CMR. <b>Added</b> value of <b>fused</b> CTCA/CMR was defined as change in assignment of culprit coronary artery to myocardial defect compared with side-by-side analysis. Results: 3 D fusion of CTCA/CMR was feasible and accurate (surface distance of blood pools: 4. 1 +/- 1. 3 mm, range: 2. 4 - 7. 1 mm; Dice similarity coefficients: 0. 78 +/- 0. 08, range: 0. 51 - 0. 86) in all patients. Side-by-side analysis of CTCA and CMR allowed no assignment of a single culprit artery to a myocardial defect in 6 of 27 (22 %) patients. Fused CTCA/CMR allowed further confinement of culprit coronary arteries in 3 of these 6 patients (11 %). Myocardial defects were reassigned in 2 of 27 (7 %) patients using fused CTCA/CMR, whereas the results remained unchanged in 22 of 27 (81 %) patients. Interobserver agreement for assignment of culprit arteries to myocardial defects increased with fused CTCA/CMR (k = 0. 66 - 0. 89). Conclusion: 3 D fusion of low-dose CTCA and functional CMR is feasible and accurate, and adds, at a low radiation dose, diagnostic value {{for the assessment of}} hemodynamically relevant CAD as compared with side-byside analysis alone. This technique can be clinically useful for the following: planning of surgical or interventional procedures in patients having a high prevalence of CAD and for improved topographic assignment of coronary stenoses to corresponding myocardial perfusion defects...|$|R
40|$|Cytokinin is an {{important}} plant hormone that controls many aspects of plant growth and development. A great amount of {{research has been done}} regarding its function and recently some significant process made on its signal transduction pathway. However much remains to be discovered and in particular the identity of tokininbinding proteins that function as signal transducing receptors would be valuable information. This study aimed to develop two yeast-based methods, to search for plant cytokinin-binding proteins. To establish the yeast three-hybrid (Y- 3 -H) system and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) screening, four different novel 6 -benzylamino purine (BAP) - dexamethasone conjugates and two kinds of biotinylated BAP conjugates were synthesized, respectively. The suitability of these specially designed cytokinin derivatives for use in the study of cytokinin-binding proteins were demonstrated by their activities in competing with the proven cytokinin signal molecule BAP in inducing a response in vivo in the Amaranthus bioassay. The design of the Y- 3 -H system was based on that reported by Licitra and Liu (1996), with modifications that included use of a different yeast host strain to allow positive selection for the LEU 2 -containing fish plasmid and creation of a new hook plasmid to make the expression of HIS 3 in yeast host L 40 useable as a reporter gene. Hybrid plant-animal hormone molecules (baits) created in Chapter II allow the animal hormone moiety to be anchored to a fusion of a DNA binding domain (DBD) with an animal hormone receptor produced by hook plasmid. The DBD can then be held in juxtaposition with a transcriptional activation domain (AD) as part of fusion protein produced by fish plasmids to create a functional bipartite transcription factor, if the <b>AD</b> is <b>fused</b> with a plant hormone receptor protein. The novel hybrid hormone thus acts as a bridge between the DBD and AD and allows transcription from reporter genes that allow the identification of individual cells in a population transformed with a plant fusion library. Individuals that have received a receptor able to bind plant hormone can then transcribe genes that allow prototrophic growth while the majority of cells are auxotrophs. Such cells can also transcribe the LacZ gene that allows hydrolysis of the substrate 5 -Bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolylb-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to a blue product. The genes that encode the cytokinin-binding proteins can then be recovered from cells with those properties. All the components, as far as could be tested, were verified for their functions before assembling together for test. A quite different approach, based on the capacity of FACS to recognize and separate microscopic particles, was also used to recover yeast cells that were expressing Arabidopsis cDNAs that increased cytokinin binding. In this screen, the plant proteins {{did not need to be}} fusions with a transcriptional AD domain. If any yeast cell expressing cytokinin-binding protein on its outer membrane, FACS should be able to identify the cell from the whole population of cells expressing plant cDNAs by the increased retention of biotinylated BAP (synthesized in Chapter II) and its consequent binding of the fluorescent streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE). Then the sorted cell can be tested to confirm that its properties are altered by the introduced gene and the identity of the cytokinin-binding protein is revealed by sequencing that gene. Test screens have been conducted with the two methods. An Arabidopsis cDNA library and a maize cDNA library that were constructed in fusion with a transcription AD have been screened with the Y- 3 -H method, while some His-independent clones were observed, none of them could activate the other reporter gene LacZ. A non fusion cDNA library of Arabidopsis screened by the FACS method has resulted in some primary positives that warrant further testing. These results together with possible future improvements of the screen methods have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant hormone}} {{salicylic}} acid (SA) {{is an essential}} activator of plant immune responses directed against biotrophic pathogens. The transcription cofactor NPR 1 (Nonexpressor of pathogenesis- related (PR) genes 1) functions to transduce the SA signal into an operational response directed to limited pathogen damage. In the absence of pathogen, NPR 1 protein resides in the cytoplasm as a large molecular weight oligomer held together by disulphide bonding. Initiation of defence signalling leads to changes in intracellular redox conditions that promote NPR 1 momomer release. Translocation of monomeric NPR 1 to the nucleus results in the activation of over 2200 immune-related genes in Arabidopsis. NPR 1 lacks a canonical DNA-binding domain but is known to perform part of its regulatory function through engagement of TGA factors (bZIP transcription factor). Induction of SA-dependent signalling is invariably associated with PR- 1 gene expression and accumulation of mRNA for this gene serves as a useful marker of defence activation. However, both functional redundancy and stochastic factors limit the effectiveness of standard genetic approaches used in plant research, and thus much of the hierarchal processes surrounding NPR 1 -dependent gene activation are not fully understood. Using a synthetic biology approach we aim to complete exploratory work and set the foundations {{for the development of}} a yeast tool that can be used to manipulate and subsequently understand NPR 1 function in relation to interacting partners and gene activation. Accordingly, using this tool we sought to create a conceptual protein circuit based on theoretical plant immunity. In completing this work we have developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that exhibits a highly oxidising intracellular redox environment. This was achieved by knocking out genes encoding S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (SFA 1), flavohemoglobin (YHB 1) and YAP 1 (bZIP transcription factor), all important components in regulating cellular redox homeostasis and protein S-nitrosylation state in S. cerevisiae. Characterisation of this cell (designated Δsfa 1 yap 1 yhb 1) reveals a high tolerance to such redox perturbations. Importantly, NPR 1 is by default, assembled predominantly in the oligomeric form in this biological chassis. By activating two inducible inputs in the form of Arabidopsis S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (AtGSNOR) and Thioredoxin (AtTRXh 5) which both function to promote NPR 1 monomerisation, we have created a switch to selectively control NPR 1 oligomer-monomer equilibrium. To complete the synthetic circuit, TGA 3 was included, along with a modified yeast MEL 1 promoter that has been customised to contain the TGA-responsive upstream activation sequence (termed the as- 1 element) present in the promoter region of the PR- 1 gene. Using FRET tools we were able to confirm nuclear interaction between monomeric NPR 1 and TGA 3, with this association appearing to induce as- 1 element binding. However this process is not sufficient to activate a Luciferase (LUC) reporter gene, even when the GAL 4 activation domain (GAL 4 <b>AD)</b> is <b>fused</b> to NPR 1. Ordinarily, a CUL 3 -dependent proteolysis-coupled transcription cycle is necessary to maintain efficient NPR 1 -dependent gene transcription in Arabidopsis. Although S. cerevisiae encodes an evolutionarily related CUL 3 ortholog, examination by western blot demonstrates that NPR 1 protein is stable in this cell, indicating an endogenous mechanism to degrade NPR 1 is either not present or not functional in yeast. As such, this synthetic yeast tool represents a completely novel approach to identify missing components functioning in NPR 1 -mediated transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, in collaboration with a skilled bioinformatician, and using a rule-based stochastic modeling tool known as Kappa, we have been able to develop, for the first time, a preliminary mathematical simulation representative of NPR 1 -dependent gene activation that can be used as a foundation for future works.
