5|$|Mercury {{does not}} react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, {{although}} oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride.

The combined butter <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> ratio has tended to be around 3.5.

5|$|The {{plant is}} known for its {{medicinal}} properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The ground leaves of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce nasal congestion, or boiled with water to make eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into the ears of camels to alleviate ticks, <b>and</b> <b>powdered</b> leaves {{can be used as a}} paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum to treat people affected with polio.|$|E
5|$|In China and Tibet, mercury use {{was thought}} to prolong life, heal fractures, and {{maintain}} generally good health, although it is now known that exposure to mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects. The first emperor of China, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì—allegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury on {{a model of the}} land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China—was killed by drinking a mercury <b>and</b> <b>powdered</b> jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists (causing liver failure, mercury poisoning, and brain death) who intended to give him eternal life. Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun, the second Tulunid ruler of Egypt (r. 884–896), known for his extravagance and profligacy, reportedly built a basin filled with mercury, on which he would lie on top of air-filled cushions and be rocked to sleep.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, <b>and</b> <b>powdered</b> a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E

40|$|Linear and {{branched}} bio-based semi-aromatic (co) polyesters {{were evaluated}} as resins for solvent-based <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> coatings. Dimethyl- 2, 5 -furandicarboxylate (DMF), 2, 3 -butanediol and various multifunctional comonomers {{were used to}} synthesize amorphous hydroxyl-end-capped (co) polyesters. The resins were cross-linked using the ¿-caprolactam blocked trimer of isophorone diisocyanate. Both the solvent-based <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> coatings proved to be hard but brittle, which {{was a result of}} the very stiff molecular structure of the formed network. This was corroborated by the Tg values obtained for the coatings, which exceeded 100 °C for both the solvent-based <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> coatings. The poly(ester urethane) coatings prepared from the branched copolyesters show a reasonable solvent resistance. However, swelling occurred during the solvent treatment, indicating an insufficient network formation. The solvent-based <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> coatings exhibit similar mechanical and physical performance, showing that in this study there was no significant influence of the preparation method. In view of the obtained results it can be concluded that DMF-based branched polyesters are interesting candidates for solvent-based <b>and</b> <b>powder</b> coating applications...|$|R
