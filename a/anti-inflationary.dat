25|$|The {{economic}} crisis in the 1990s has been widely cited in the Anglo-American press as a social democratic failure, {{but it is important}} to note not only did profit rates begin to fall worldwide after the 1960s, also this period saw neoliberal ascendance in Social Democratic ideology and policies as well as the rise of bourgeois coalition rule in place of the Social Democrats. 1980s Social Democratic neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to <b>anti-inflationary</b> policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.|$|E

50|$|During the 1957-59 period, {{known as}} the pre-stabilization years, {{economic}} planners contented themselves with piecemeal measures such as moderate <b>anti-inflationary</b> stopgaps and increases in Spain's links with the world economy.

50|$|In 1975 American economists Sidney Weintraub (1914-1983) and Henry Wallich (1914-1988) {{published}} A Tax-Based Incomes Policy, promoting Tax-Based Incomes Policy (TIP), {{using the}} income tax mechanism to implement an <b>anti-inflationary</b> incomes policy. In 1978 Weintraub and American economist Paul Davidson (1930-) founded the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics. This {{opened the door to}} many younger economists such as E. Ray Canterbery (1935-).

5000|$|In his proposal, Hall states his {{position}} {{against the idea}} of a government holding reserves under any type of a commodity standard. He argues that by allowing the government to manipulate the market, the <b>anti-inflationary</b> purpose of the commodity standard would be invalidated. This statement by Hall allows for a wider variation in commodities to be used as the bundle. For example, if the government wanted to hold reserves of a certain commodity, it would certainly not choose plywood because of the size (compared to gold, which has relatively concentrated wealth) and potential deterioration.|$|E
5000|$|The inflationary {{pressures}} of the Lawson Boom {{were one of the}} reasons given for the UK's entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990, a move that was supposed to help restrain inflation (which had been approaching 10%) in the UK by [...] "importing" [...] the <b>anti-inflationary</b> credibility of the Bundesbank. However, the economy fell into its third recession in less than 20 years, with unemployment coming close to 3 million by the end of 1992, even though this time the Conservatives managed to gain re-election.|$|E
5000|$|Juan Carlos Fábrega, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} Central Bank President in November 2013 amid {{a sharp decline in}} foreign exchange reserves, had managed to stanch the reserve losses; but his soft-touch regulatory approach towards the [...] "blue" [...] dollar market and numerous news leaks from the Central Bank led to Fábrega's resignation on 1 October and his replacement with the CNV director. Fábrega's <b>anti-inflationary</b> monetary policy, which raised the benchmark 3-month note interest rate to over 28% during 2014 and thereby helped absorb around US$5 billion in liquidity from an overheated economy, was, however, largely maintained by Vanoli.|$|E
50|$|The Center for Economic Policy Research's (CEPR) Dean Baker (2006) {{argued that}} {{the driving force behind}} rising {{inequality}} in the U.S. has been a series of deliberate, neoliberal policy choices including <b>anti-inflationary</b> bias, anti-unionism, and profiteering in the health industry. However, countries have applied neoliberal policies at varying levels of intensity; for example, the OECD has calculated that only 6% of Swedish workers are beset with wages it considers low, and that Swedish wages are overall lower. Others argue that Sweden's adoption of neoliberal reforms, in particular the privatization of public services and reduced state benefits, has resulted in income inequality growing faster in Sweden than any other OECD nation.|$|E
50|$|Monetary policy {{during the}} Korean War, {{centered}} around {{the issue of whether}} or not the Federal Reserve should continue its prewar policy of setting a floor under the prices of government bonds or whether it should allow prices to drop, in order to restrict money and credit growth to restrict inflation. Truman and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snyder strongly were in favor of the former strategy of pegging government bond prices, but the Federal Reserve saw the need to encourage macroeconomic stability, meaning fighting inflation. At the outbreak of the war, prices surged; by February 1951, the monthly increase in the consumer price index was almost 20 percent annually. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve followed an <b>anti-inflationary</b> policy.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} of credibility first emerged along with concern about certain institutional interventions failing. In the mid-20th century Vilhelm Aubert {{noted that the}} Housemaid Law in Norway had been implemented but flaunted by all involved actors. The concept of credibility was initially coined as an explanandum for the success and failure of Western monetary, <b>anti-inflationary</b> policies in the 1970s. A concern for the credibility of policy emerged {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century in response to frequently observed failures of neoliberal structural adjustments in the developing world associated with the Washington Consensus. Institutional reform, such as privatization, failed to deliver the predicted economic growth, not because of lacking credible commitment on part of actors but due to the absence of endogenous credibility.|$|E
50|$|This is {{historic}} legislation. It {{will remove}} 45 years of excessive and inflationary Government restrictions and redtape. It {{will have a}} powerful <b>anti-inflationary</b> effect, reducing consumer costs {{by as much as}} $8 billion each year. And by ending wasteful practices, it will conserve annually hundreds of millions of gallons of precious fuel. All the citizens of our Nation will benefit from this legislation. Consumers will benefit, because almost every product we purchase has been shipped by truck, and outmoded regulations have inflated the prices that each one of us must pay. The shippers who use trucking will benefit as new service and price options appear. Labor will benefit from increased job opportunities. And the trucking industry itself will benefit from greater flexibility and new opportunities for innovation.|$|E
50|$|In Canada the {{transition}} was less clearly marked, though Pierre Trudeau {{had begun to}} adopt monetarist <b>anti-inflationary</b> measures as early as 1975. Likewise for most of continental Europe except for France, {{the transition}} away from Keynesian economics was less distinct, partly as Keynes had not been as important there, since European states had generally pursued Dirigiste measures even before Keynes, never having embraced classical economics in the first place. In France, François Mitterrand {{came to power in}} 1981 with a commitment to expansionary Keynesian policy, to help reduce unemployment caused by the worldwide recession underway at the time. Similar to what had happened after Léon Blum's election back in 1936, many of the wealthy moved their money out of France, and by 1983 Mitterrand had been forced to largely abandon Keynesian policy.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{formation}} of the Economic Advisory Committee, announced on September 27, 2015 at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton, then BBC News Economics Editor Robert Peston contended that the composition of the panel, which included Simon Wren-Lewis and Joseph Stiglitz, signalled that the policy was probably dead, as he felt that while this particular group of economists would, [...] "back the notion of the government taking advantage of prevailing low interest rates to borrow considerably more for investment in infrastructure," [...] they would not support the ultra formulation of the policy, [...] "for fear that the <b>anti-inflationary</b> credentials of the Bank of England would be destroyed", and that if the policy survived it would be as, [...] "a contingent rainy-day monetary tool, for when the economy is next in direst straits." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} the Korean War on the Economy of the United States refers {{to the ways in}} which the American economy was {{affected}} by the Korean experience from 1950 to 1953. While the cost of the Korean War was less significant than that of World War II, it still changed the structure of the American growth as a result of its financing. The Korean War boosted GDP growth through government spending, which in turn constrained investment and consumption. While taxes were raised significantly to finance the war, the Federal Reserve followed an <b>anti-inflationary</b> policy. Though there was a large increase in prices at the outset of the war, price and wage controls ultimately stabilized prices by the end of the war. Consumption and investment continued to grow after the war, but below the trend rate prior to the war.|$|E
5000|$|Rodriguez was re-elected in the 1988 federal election, as the Mulroney {{government}} {{was returned to}} office with a reduced majority. He was appointed as his party's consumer and corporate affairs critic, and in this capacity he became a prominent opponent of the Mulroney government's Goods And Services Tax. He {{took part in a}} committee filibuster on the issue with fellow MP Dave Barrett and tried to have public hearings on the tax across Canada. [...] Rodriguez was also strongly critical of the severe <b>anti-inflationary</b> policies pursued by Bank of Canada governor John Crow, arguing that the recession of the early 1990s was exacerbated by high interest rates that undermined consumer confidence. [...] He called on the federal government to set credit card interest rates in 1989, after a series of dramatic increases at several major banks.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the committee, Robert Peston contended that the composition of the panel signalled that People's Quantitative Easing, the policy of requiring the Bank of England to print money to finance government investment, which had up to that point been considered the cornerstone of Jeremy Corbyn's economic policy, was probably dead, as he felt that while this particular group of economists would, [...] "back the notion of the government taking advantage of prevailing low interest rates to borrow considerably more for investment in infrastructure," [...] they would not support the ultra formulation of the policy, [...] "for fear that the <b>anti-inflationary</b> credentials of the Bank of England would be destroyed", and that if the policy survived it would be as, [...] "a contingent rainy-day monetary tool, for when the economy is next in direst straits." ...|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} CRR, banks are {{required}} to maintain liquid assets {{in the form of}} gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an <b>anti-inflationary</b> impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts thebank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities. In well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market—to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting more to open market operations in the more recent years.

5000|$|In 1947 most {{foreign policy}} liberals {{believed}} that a massive recovery program for European democracies was necessary to prevent their succumbing to Soviet aggression or to subversion by totalitarian ideology. In response to an urgent plea by Columbia scholars, Congress authorized interim relief. But there was fear {{that the level of}} assistance needed would put intolerable inflationary pressure on the U.S. economy. It was the Harvard faculty this time that provided the suggestion: an allocation program to moderate demand, restricting credit and if necessary price controls. Wage policy was not specifically enumerated but Coxs name on the list made clear that that would be part of the [...] "aggressive <b>anti-inflationary</b> measures" [...] that might be resorted to. That spring aid relief began under the Marshall Plan but no mechanism to intervene with the economy, especially wages, was introduced to replace the National Wage Stabilization Board, which had expired in 1947.|$|E
50|$|The Argentine Senate {{approved}} a {{reform of the}} Central Bank charter on 22 March 2012. Under the new regime the government will be free to pay public debt using the Central Bank's reserves. The bank would also be enabled to expand its lending capacity to the Treasury, effectively giving a boost to the government's finances. Marcó del Pont's successor, National Bank President Juan Carlos Fábrega, shifted monetary policy to an <b>anti-inflationary</b> stance during 2014, however, raising the benchmark 3-month note interest rate to over 28%. The rate hike {{had the effect of}} reducing Central Bank operating profits, which reached a record US$12 billion in 2014, by up to 90%; but it also absorbed around US$5 billion in liquidity from the economy, and contributed to a reduction in inflation from an estimated 37% in 2014 to around 25%. This policy was largely continued by Fábrega's successor, former National Securities Commission President Alejandro Vanoli.|$|E
50|$|Following up on {{the ideas}} of Kicking Away the Ladder, Chang {{published}} Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism in December 2008. Chang countered Irwin's criticisms by arguing that countries that had failed to develop had generally followed free market policies. Chang also argued that while state interventionism sometimes produced economic failures, it had a better record than unregulated free market economies which, he maintained, very rarely succeeded in producing economic development. He cited evidence that GDP growth in developing countries had been higher prior to external pressures recommending deregulation and extended his analysis to the failures of free trade to induce growth through privatisation and <b>anti-inflationary</b> policies. Chang's book won plaudits from Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz for its fresh insight and effective blend of contemporary and historical cases but was criticised by former World Bank economist William Easterly, who said that Chang used selective evidence in his book. Chang responded to Easterly's criticisms, asserting that Easterly misread his argument. Easterly in turn provided a counter-reply.|$|E
50|$|The Guyanese dollar (currency sign: $, G$ and GY$; ISO: GYD) {{has been}} the unit of account in Guyana (formerly British Guiana) since 29 January 1839. Originally it was {{intended}} as a transitional unit to facilitate the changeover from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system. The Spanish dollar was already prevalent throughout the West Indies in general, and from 1839, the Spanish dollar unit operated in British Guiana in conjunction with British sterling coins at a standard conversion rate of one dollar for every four shillings and twopence. In 1951 the British sterling coinage was replaced with a new decimal coinage which was simultaneously introduced through all the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean. When sterling began to depreciate in the early 1970s, a switch to a US dollar peg became increasingly attractive as an <b>anti-inflationary</b> measure and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority (of which Guyana was a member) made the switch in October 1975. The Guyanese dollar is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively G$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.|$|E
5000|$|As {{global trade}} {{expanded}} after the 1979-1982 recession, some American industries, {{such as the}} steel and automobile sectors, which had long thrived in a large domestic market, were increasingly exposed to foreign competition. Specialization, lower wages, and lower energy costs allowed developing nations entering the global market to export high quantities of low cost goods to the United States. Simultaneously, domestic <b>anti-inflationary</b> measures (e.g. higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve) led to a 65% increase in the exchange value of the US dollar in the early 1980s. The stronger dollar acted in effect as an equal percent tax on American exports and equal percent subsidy on foreign imports. [...] American producers, particularly manufacturers, struggled to compete both overseas and in the US marketplace, prompting calls for new legislation to protect domestic industries. [...] In addition, the recession of 1979-82 did not exhibit the traits of a typical recessionary cycle of imports, where imports temporarily decline during a downturn and return to normal during recovery. Due to the high dollar exchange rate, importers still found a favorable market in the United States despite the recession. As a result, imports continued to increase in the recessionary period and further increased in the recovery period, leading to an all-time high trade deficit and import penetration rate. The high dollar exchange rate in combination with high interest rates also created an influx of foreign capital flows to the United States and decreased investment opportunities for American businesses and individuals.|$|E
