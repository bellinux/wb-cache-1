40|$|Ensiling is {{a method}} of {{preserving}} a moist crop. A moist crop can support {{the growth of a}} wide range of microorganisms, most of which will degrade the nutrient value to livestock. However, ensiling generally controls microbial activity by a combination of an anaerobic environment and a natural fermentation of sugars by lactic acid bacteria on the crop. This fermentation and the resulting low pH primarily suppress the growth of other anaerobic microorganisms. The fermentation can also inhibit yeasts, molds and aerobic bacteria, but the anaerobic environment is essential to preventing most of the spoilage microorganisms from growing. Inoculants have become the dominant <b>additives</b> <b>for</b> making <b>silage.</b> Homofermentative strains help guarantee a rapid suppression of anaerobic stains early in storage, increase dry matter recovery and have improved animal performance by means that we do not fully understand. Inoculants containing Lactobacillus buchneri, a heterofermentative species capable of fermenting lactic acid to acetic, are recent additives. The added acetic acid inhibits yeast and mold growth, increasing aerobic stability of silages at feeding...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of sodium diacetate (SDA) on fermentation profile, chemical composition and aerobic stability of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silage. Methods Fresh alfalfa was ensiled with various concentrations of SDA (0, 3, 5, 7, and 9 g/kg of fresh forage). After 60 days of the ensiling, the samples were collected to examine the fermentative quality, chemical composition and aerobic stability. Results The application of SDA significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased silage pH with the lowest value in silage with 7 g/kg of SDA. The proliferations of enterobacteria, yeasts, molds and clostridia were inhibited by SDA, resulted in lower ethanol, propionic and butyric acid concentrations and dry matter loss in SDA treated silages than control. The increasing SDA linearly decreased free amino acid N (p< 0. 001), ammonia N (p = 0. 018) and non-protein N (p< 0. 001), while linearly increased water soluble carbohydrate (p< 0. 001) and peptide N (p< 0. 001). It is speculated that SDA accelerated the shift from homofermentative to heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria during the silage fermentation, indicated by lower lactic acid production in SDA- 9 than SDA- 7 silages after 60 days of ensiling. Alfalfa silages treated with SDA at 7 g/kg had highest Flieg’s point and remained stable more than 9 d during aerobic exposure under humid and hot conditions in southern China.

40|$|In the July 2005 {{issue of}} the Michigan Dairy Review, I {{explained}} why I do not recommend using “Milk per Acre ” as a method for selecting corn hybrids <b>for</b> <b>silage.</b> Instead, I suggested using a partial budget method {{to determine the best}} hybrid for an individual dairy farm because several factors that affect profitability related to corn hybrid selection vary across farms.

The effect of single or multiple grazing of winter cereal forages by lactating dairy cattle on dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value at grazing and on subsequent silage production harvested at the soft-dough stage of growth was determined in three studies in south-western Victoria. In the first two studies, a range of forage cereals and an annual ryegrass were grazed either once (G 1) during tillering (GS 21 – 29), followed by locking up <b>for</b> <b>silage,</b> grazed twice (G 2) (GS 21 – 29 and GS 32 – 34), followed by locking up <b>for</b> <b>silage,</b> or not grazed (NG) and harvested <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> only. In the third study, two forage cerealswere either ungrazed (NG) or grazed at eitherGS 21,GS 24,GS 30 orGS 32 and subsequently locked up and harvested <b>for</b> <b>silage.</b> All silage harvests occurred at GS 84 (soft dough). In all studies, grazing at early tillering resulted inDMyieldof less than 1. 4 tDM/ha, although crudeprotein (CP) (30 – 37 %DM) andestimatedmetabolisable energy (ME) (12. 2 – 14 MJ/kg DM) were high. Deferring grazing until the start of stem elongation resulted in higher DM yields (1. 8 – 4. 3 t DM/ha).
