5|$|In 2013, a well-preserved carcass {{was found}} on Maly Lyakhovsky Island, one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 {{years old at the}} time of death. The carcass {{contained}} well-preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted from the ice, liquid blood spilled from the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity.</b> The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed anti-freezing properties.|$|E
5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity.</b> Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity),</b> and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
50|$|The fossil remains show {{soft tissue}} preservation, {{mostly in the}} {{thoracic}} and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities,</b> though portions were also seen in the skull. Apart from remains of potential food material, these remains have not been thoroughly examined.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, {{multiple}} {{varieties of}} nematodes {{have been found}} in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities</b> of the primitively social sweat bee, Lasioglossum zephyrum. Inside the female body, the nematode hinders ovarian development and renders the bee less active and thus less effective in pollen collection.|$|R
40|$|Thoracic {{actinomycosis}} is {{an uncommon}} disease and often presents difficulty in diagnosis. Two cases {{are presented in}} which thoracic actinomycosis produced fistulae between the thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities.</b> Surgical drainage and high dose penicillin for at least 4 - 6 months was the treatment of choice...|$|R
5|$|The bohor reedbuck is host {{to several}} parasites. The most notable helminths {{found in the}} bohor reedbuck are Carmyerius papillatus (in the rumen), Stilesia globipunctata (in the small intestine), Trichuris globulosa (in the caecum), Setaria species (in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity),</b> Dictyocaulus species (in the lungs) and Taenia cysts (in the muscles). Other parasites include Schistosoma bovis, Cooperia rotundispiculum, Haemonchus contortus, species of Oesophagostomum, Amphistoma and Stilesia. The common ticks found on the bohor reedbuck are Amblyomma species and Rhipicephalus evertsi.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity,</b> eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E
2500|$|Feeding larvae of Calliphoridae flies are the {{dominant}} insect group at carcasses during the active decay stage.

5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some people, {{the disease}} {{proceeds}} to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is {{leakage of plasma}} from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation {{in the chest and}} <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs. There may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract. Shock (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pelvic floor}} has two {{inherently}} conflicting functions: One is {{to close the}} pelvic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities</b> and bear the load of the visceral organs; {{the other is to}} control the openings of the rectum and urogenital organs that pierce the pelvic floor and make it weaker. [...] To achieve both these tasks, the pelvic floor is composed of several overlapping sheets of muscles and connective tissues.|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of {{nematodes}} representing the genus Litomosoides were obtained from pocket gophers collected in the early 1960 s and during 1982 in Colorado. Individuals of Litomosoides thomomydis n. sp. were recovered from the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities</b> of two species of pocket gopher, Thomomys tulpoides (Richardson) and T. bottae (Eydoux 2 ̆ 6 Gervais). Nematodes representing L. westi n. sp. were recovered from the <b>abdominal</b> and pleural <b>cavities</b> of the plains pocket gopher Geomys bursarius (Shaw) from eastern Colorado. These two species of filarioid nematodes appear to be restricted in geographical range to those pocket gophers inhabiting the central grasslands and Rocky Mountain region of the United States and Canada...|$|R
5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities</b> of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|R
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Jack Horner {{and colleagues}} {{published}} an extremely preliminary {{report of a}} tyrannosaurid from the upper parts of the Campanian Two Medicine Formation in Montana, which was interpreted as a transitional species between Daspletosaurus and the later Tyrannosaurus. Currie (2003) stated that the tyrannosaurid from the Two Medicine Formation mentioned by Horner et al. (1992) may be an unnamed third species of Daspletosaurus. Another partial skeleton was reported from the Upper Two Medicine in 2001, preserving {{the remains of a}} juvenile hadrosaur in its <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity.</b> This specimen was assigned to Daspletosaurus but not to any particular species. The remains of at least three more Daspletosaurus have also been described in a Two Medicine bonebed by Currie et al. (2005); the authors stated that this fossil material likely represents then-unnamed species mentioned by Horner et al. (1992), but cautioned that further study and description of Daspletosaurus would be necessary before the species can be determined with certainty. In 2017, the Two Medicine Formation taxon was named as the new species D. horneri.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity,</b> forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
30|$|All {{animals were}} {{subjected}} to a fully detailed necropsy and gross pathological examination following their respective scheduled terminations. The examination included the external body surface, all orifices, cranial, thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities</b> and their contents and any abnormality or gross pathological changes observed in tissues and/or organs. The following organs/tissues were collected and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin (approximately 4 % formaldehyde solution) and analyzed by Patho-Lab Diagnostics Ltd.: heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, brain, inguinal, lymph nodes injection sites (thigh muscle) and thymus.|$|R
25|$|A risk {{of ovarian}} {{stimulation}} {{is the development}} of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, particularly if hCG is used for inducing final oocyte maturation. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities</b> and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.|$|R
25|$|A serous {{membrane}} (also {{referred to as}} a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavities.</b> The {{serous membrane}}s have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity. For example, the pericardium is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart.|$|R
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity</b> was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the <b>abdominal</b> <b>cavity,</b> and the pleural cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E
