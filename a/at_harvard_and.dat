5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs.

Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role <b>at</b> <b>Harvard,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently at MIT and New York University.

5|$|Tech {{began its}} {{football}} program with several students forming a loose-knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths. The first season saw Tech play three games and lose all three.

Leonard Wood, an army officer who had played football <b>at</b> <b>Harvard</b> <b>and</b> was then stationed in Atlanta and taking graduate courses at the school, volunteered {{to serve as the}} team's player-coach.

The angry Georgia fans threw stones and other debris at the Tech players during and after the game. The poor treatment of the Blacksmiths by the Georgia faithful gave birth to the rivalry now known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.|$|E
