5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

Because it was <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> belong to the unit, care was taken to ensure that soldiers from each of the 13 states were represented in the Guard. Major Caleb Gibbs of Rhode Island was the first commander of the Guard, and was given the title of captain commandant. Gibbs was succeeded in 1779 by William Colfax.|$|E
25|$|Other small incomes {{came from}} customs fees and fines. In {{times of war}} a special tax was levied on rich {{citizens}}. These citizens were also charged permanently with other taxes {{for the good of}} the city. This was called the system of liturgy.

Traditionally, it is considered an affront and not <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> have a newborn named after an older relative, so that full names are rarely passed down through a family {{in the manner of}} American English Seniors, Juniors, III, etc. Similarly, it is considered disadvantageous for the child to bear a name already made famous by someone else, although Romanizations might be identical or a common name like Liu Xiang might be borne by tens of thousands.|$|E

25|$|New York City, in {{the middle}} of the 20th century, was at a zenith of {{economic}} power and world prestige. Unconcerned by BIE rules, nations with smaller economies (as well as private groups in (or relevant to) some BIE members) saw it as <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> host an exhibit at the Fair. Therefore, smaller nations made up the majority of the international participation. Spain, Vatican City, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Thailand, Philippines, Greece, and Pakistan, and Ireland to name some, hosted national presences at the Fair. Indonesia sponsored a pavilion, but relations deteriorated rapidly between that nation and the USA during 1964, fueled by anti-Western and anti-American rhetoric and policies by Indonesian president Sukarno, which angered US President Lyndon Johnson. Indonesia withdrew from the United Nations in January 1965, and officially from the Fair in March. The Fair Corporation then seized and shut down the Indonesian pavilion, and it remained closed and barricaded for the 1965 season.|$|E
