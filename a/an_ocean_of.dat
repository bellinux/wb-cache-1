5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is {{equivalent}} to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture {{is referred to as}} icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7,000km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may be <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.|$|E

25|$|Other mechanisms, such as melting from a {{meteorite}} impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, {{and the outer}} several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> magma.

25|$|Great Desert: It {{lies between}} Calormen and the {{northern}} countries of Archenland and Narnia. Located immediately {{to the north of}} the Carlomen capital Tashbaan, the desert can be crossed on horseback in about a night and a day of hard riding. The desert provides some protection from Calormen invasion since the springs at the great oasis would not be sufficient to enable an army of any size to cross it. This oasis is halfway across the desert; however a secret and well watered valley leads into Archenland. The desert is described as <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> sand by Narnians. It can be bypassed by sea as the Calormenes do in The Last Battle. The Hermit of the Southern March lives north of it. Beyond it is Anvard and Narnia.(HHB)(LB).|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} half year, {{the air on}} the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little {{exchange}} to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. This weather is called inversion because the temperature below the fog {{is lower than the}} temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days or even for weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, a cold wind from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60km/h with top speeds of more than 100km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm foehn wind.|$|E
25|$|However, these {{hypotheses}} were all refuted {{by the late}} 1960s and early 1970s Apollo lunar missions, which introduced a stream of new scientific evidence; specifically concerning the Moon's composition, its age, and its history. These lines of evidence contradict many predictions made by these earlier models. The rocks brought back from the Moon showed a marked decrease in water relative to rocks elsewhere in the Solar System, and also evidence of <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> magma early in its history, indicating that its formation must have produced {{a great deal of}} energy. Also, oxygen isotopes in lunar rocks showed a marked similarity to those on Earth, suggesting that they formed at a similar location in the solar nebula. The capture model fails to explain the similarity in these isotopes (if the Moon had originated {{in another part of the}} Solar System, those isotopes would have been different), while the co-accretion model cannot adequately explain the loss of water (if the Moon formed in a similar fashion to the Earth, the amount of water trapped in its mineral structure would also be roughly similar). Conversely, the fission model, while it can account for the similarity in chemical composition and the lack of iron in the Moon, cannot adequately explain its high orbital inclination and, in particular, the large amount of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon system, more than any other planet–satellite pair in the Solar System.|$|E

A review of Rapture from New Age Voice states Joseph [...] "paints romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet, intimate passages to big, energetic movements". [...] "The arrangements are structured so that the trumpet can lead a line out on 'Be Still' signaling an introspective sort of mood; yet the strings swell on 'The Passage' engulfing the listener in <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> sound."

500|$|The opening chase scene, {{involving}} Gosling's character, {{was filmed}} primarily by Refn within the car's interior. In an interview, he revealed {{the idea for}} this scene was to emulate {{the feeling of a}} [...] "diver in <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> sharks," [...] never leaving the vehicle during a car chase so that the audience can see what's happening from the character's point of view. Tight on money and time, he shot the scene in two days. With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director found it difficult to have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set-ups nearby. As downtown Los Angeles had been rejuvenated, Refn avoided certain areas to maintain the novel's gloomy atmosphere, which was helped by the scene being shot at low-angles with minimal light.|$|E
500|$|American Beauty {{follows a}} {{traditional}} narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky {{from the middle}} of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot [...] "occupies no time [...] all time", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it [...] "stretches on forever like <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> time". Furby argues that a [...] "rhythm of repetition" [...] forms the core of the film's structure. For example, two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness. Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly [...] "voyeuristic and exhibitionist" [...] scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.|$|E

500|$|Somerset were {{stripped}} of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton, during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. In Somerset's first match of 1886, Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years, scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241. The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents, Warwickshire, in the second innings; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory, Somerset were bowled out for 58. Throughout 1886, Sainsbury's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in {{the previous two years}} of first-class cricket, and he regularly made scores in the twenties and thirties. He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid-August, his highest score of the season. Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county, but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start. A victory over Essex, in which Sainsbury scored 71, was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Against Hampshire, Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset, scoring 164 {{out of a total of}} 315, to help his side on their way to a six-wicket victory. A big win over Warwickshire followed, and the county was said to be [...] "a ship heading out for <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>of</b> prosperity".|$|E
