In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang {{as to whether the}} two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible.|$|E

Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{differences}} in transformational leadership were investigated using NSW police student ratings of their field leaders (EDOs) {{at both the}} beginning and end of training. According to Bass (1998), female leaders should be more transformational (and effective) than males. Contrary to this prediction, Study 1 revealed that junior police students (n= 162) rated their male EDOs as being significantly more transformational and effective than their female EDOs. Furthermore, female leaders were seen as significantly more laissez-faire than males, a style which is not appropriate in field training. In a follow up study (Study 2), leader ratings from a sample (n= 194) of students who had reached the end of their formal training revealed no differences between male and female leaders on any of the variables discussed above.
