40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of beliefs about uncertainty on interpretive biases and <b>access</b> to <b>threat</b> schemata. Individuals from the community and undergraduate students (N = 74) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two experimental conditions: positive beliefs about uncertainty (N = 37) and negative beliefs about uncertainty (N = 37). To manipulate beliefs about uncertainty, participants watched a presentation on problem solving that contained information about either positive or negative effects of uncertainty on problem solving. To assess interpretive biases, participants completed a modified version of the Ambiguous/Unambiguous Situations Diary. Participants read potentially threatening passages and rated their level of worry. Passages were then disambiguated either positively or negatively and participants rated the likelihood and the value of these events. To assess <b>access</b> to <b>threat</b> schemata, the Catastrophizing Interview was administered, which is a structured worry task that assesses various aspects of the worry process, using the downward arrow technique. The results indicated that, relative to the positive beliefs about uncertainty group, participants in the negative beliefs about uncertainty group rated the positively disambiguated scenarios as less positive and the average likelihood of feared consequences to personal worries as more probable. This study provides support for the notion that beliefs about uncertainty may have an effect on interpretations of ambiguous situations as well as ease of <b>access</b> to <b>threat</b> schemata...|$|R

The evolution of the practice to one that is more based in the provision of cognitive services through the delivery of direct patient care may offer advantages to new practitioners. Some data indicate that women have a greater interest in the direct patient care aspects of their practice over that of their male counterparts. In addition, as more women enter the practice and advance into leadership roles the traditional views of girls and young women will change. Finally, policy changes are more likely to occur to facilitate and support women in the profession.

Using a well-validated neurophysiological index of working memory storage, we demonstrate that threat-related distracters were difficult to filter on average and that this difficulty was exaggerated among anxious individuals. These results indicate that dispositionally anxious individuals allocate excessive working memory storage to threat, even when it is irrelevant to the task at hand.

This study investigated the experiences of Chinese with mental health problems, to inform measures to make services more responsive to the needs of this group. Qualitative methods of analysis were applied to interview data in order to explore ways of finding help, barriers to accessing mainstream mental health care, experiences in care, factors jeopardizing the quality of care, and views on mental health services among Chinese migrants in the Netherlands. Rather than recruiting individuals with mental health problems, an indirect method was used in which ethnic Chinese participants were invited to tell us about one or more Chinese individuals in their social environment whom they regarded as having (had) mental health problems (). Although most Chinese regarded mainstream Dutch care as the appropriate resource for dealing with mental health problems, many barriers to <b>access</b> and <b>threats</b> to care quality were reported. In contrast to the widely accepted view that cultural differences in health beliefs underlie the low utilization of mental health services by Chinese in the West, the main obstacles identified in this study concerned practical issues such as communication problems and lack of knowledge of the health system. Respondents also described concerns about entitlement to care and discrimination (actual or anticipated). Measures suggested by respondents for improving care included increased use of interpreters and cultural mediators, encouraging migrants to increase their language proficiency, and better dissemination of information about the health system.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} three questions: why has universal {{potable water}} access not been achieved {{with the water}} policy changes made in Bolivia between 1990 and 2000 ? What {{can be learned from}} the water policy changes implemented in Chile between 1980 and 1999 ? Finally, what changes can be made to both countries’ water policies to ensure the sustainable use of water resources? To answer these questions, this thesis reviews water policy changes in Chile as a result of World Bank loans before privatization in the 1980 s and compare them to the water policy changes in Bolivia as a result of World Bank loans in the 1990 s in the form of water privatization. I argue that water privatization is neither the solution to lack of water access nor the solution to water scarcity. Secondary sources were used to analyze the historical differences of water policy in Santiago, Chile and La Paz, Bolivia to see the effectiveness of privatization as a universal water provider and a solution to water scarcity. The results show that the water policy changes that were implemented in Santiago, Chile before privatization were more effective in supplying affordable water to citizens than the immediate privatization in La Paz, Bolivia. I also analyze the effectiveness of water privatization in both countries, as it pertains to the scarcity of water resources in each region. I argue that privatization of the water sector failed to prepare for water scarcity and I recommend institutional pluralism with sustainable water policy at the forefront as a solution to lack of water <b>access</b> and <b>threat</b> of water scarcity in Bolivia and Chile...|$|R
