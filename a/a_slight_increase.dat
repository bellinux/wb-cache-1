5|$|Big Brother 11 was the {{eleventh}} {{season of the}} American reality television series Big Brother. It {{is based upon the}} Netherlands series of the same name, which gained notoriety in 1999 and 2000. The series premiered on CBS on July 9, 2009 and lasted ten weeks until the live finale on September 15, 2009. The eleventh season saw <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in ratings when compared to the past season of the series, which had some of the lowest ratings to date. The season premiered to a total of 6.59 million viewers, <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> from the previous season's launch. Despite this, it is the second lowest premiere for a season behind Big Brother 10. The season finale had a total of 7.78 million viewers, continuing to average slightly above the past season. In total, the series averaged 7.19 million viewers, higher than that of the previous two seasons. Big Brother 11 featured a total of 13 HouseGuests, one of which was a returning player from a previous season. The series ended after 73 days, in which HouseGuest Jordan Lloyd was crowned the winner and Natalie Martinez the runner-up.|$|E

5|$|A {{studbook}} {{was created}} for the breed in 1884, and was closed in 1922. A breeders' association was created in 1923. The {{first half of the}} 20th century saw declining populations of horses and mules due to increased mechanization, and, by 1945, Poitevin breeding was oriented towards the production of meat. The population dropped precipitously, and between 1970 and 1990 varied between 250 and 300 animals, with still lower levels seen in the early 1990s. A genetic study released in 1994 showed genetic bottlenecking and a severe risk of inbreeding, and led to the establishment of a conservation plan. Despite <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, the Poitevin is still in danger of extinction, with a slightly downward-trending population.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone. Early on September17, Julia weakened to a tropical depression. Despite <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued {{to take its}} toll on the increasingly ill-defined storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12hours. While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, Météo-France's {{office on}} the island of Réunion (MFR) started {{monitoring}} a tropical depression to the northeast of Madagascar. At this time, the depression developed a closed circulation, which received a rating of T1.5 on the Dvorak Scale, a tool used to estimate a system's intensity. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first classified the system, designating it as 14S. Following <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in organization, the depression moved southwest and quickly crossed the tip of northern Madagascar. After weakening over land, the depression reentered the Mozambique channel near Analalava on February 25.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September10. Tracking westward, the wave split into two portions, with the slower-moving northern portion ultimately developing into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on September16. The southern portion crossed Venezuela and Colombia and emerged into the Pacific, where a large area of deep convection began to form. A well-defined low pressure area developed on September26, and organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1p.m.CDT) the same day while situated about 335mi (540km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero. Six hours later, after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique showed <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in intensity, the depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named Marty by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At the time, the storm was moving slowly northward due to the influence of a large mid- to upper-level trough.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} {{tropical storm}} status, significant intensification was limited due to <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in wind shear {{as well as}} impeded outflow. The slowing of the strengthening trend was temporary, and by early on April 16 the organization had rapidly improved. As a result, the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm. Warm water temperatures contributed to further intensification, and an eye formed {{in the center of}} the convection. At 1200UTC on April 16, the JMA classified Neoguri as a typhoon about 350km (220mi) east of Qui Nhon, Vietnam. An approaching mid-level trough turned the typhoon northwestward, which enhanced outflow and contributed to further intensification. Late on April 17, the JTWC assessed Neoguri as attaining peak winds of 175km/h (110mph), averaged over a duration of one minute, near the Paracel Islands. Early the next day, the JMA estimated Neoguri reached its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph), about 190km (120mi) east of Sanya on the southern tip of Hainan.|$|E
5|$|By 1913, Large Black had by {{then spread}} {{throughout}} most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania. The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because {{of their ability to}} thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population, with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first exports to the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985.

5|$|The Poitevin had <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in {{popularity}} {{at the beginning}} of the 21st century, and could count approximately 100 farms perpetuating the breed. The association had around 300 members, as well as 83 stallions and 189 mares registered. However, by 2006, the Poitevin was still considered the most endangered French horse breed, with less than 100 births per year and a slightly decreasing population. There is almost no crossbreeding done with outside breeds, in order to maintain the numbers of purebred stock. In 2008, a second genetic study was conducted in partnership with the Institut national de la recherche agronomique; this study considered the Poitevin and four other French breeds to be endangered. It suggested making these breeds a conservation priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among the French horse population.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Julia trace {{back to a}} {{vigorous}} tropical wave, or an equatorward low-pressure area, which emerged into the Atlantic along the western coast of Africa on September11. At the time, the system maintained deep convection and strong easterly winds, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to commence tracking the system as an area of interest. As the wave moved generally westward at 10 to 15mph (16 to 24km/h), a quick increase in organization {{as well as a}} significant drop in surface pressure became notable. The system continued to organize, and several hours later, the NHC noted only <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> would suffice {{for the development of a}} tropical cyclone. By September12, a tropical depression developed, and the NHC initiated advisories at 1500UTC that day. At the time, the cyclone was situated 250mi (400km) southeast of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of a strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico, the depression moved northwestward into an area of moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. By 06:00UTC on September6, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Linda. Due to a decrease in wind shear, Linda began to undergo rapid deepening shortly thereafter. Between that day and early on September7, the storm increased in convective banding and developed central dense overcast; satellite imagery also indicated that an eye was forming around that time. At 06:00UTC on September7, Linda intensified into a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Just six hours later, the cyclone reached Category2 status. Due to <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in wind shear and possibly an intrusion from dry air, Linda temporarily remained steady in intensity while passing between Socorro Island and Clarion Island. Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Linda to a Category 1 hurricane at 0:300UTC on September8, though post-analysis concludes that the storm remained a Category2.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, the {{intensification}} {{became more}} rapid and Helene {{quickly became a}} Category2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection. Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic, which {{was in response to}} a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north. The northward turn shifted the course away from any land areas. The intensification continued through the afternoon, and that evening, Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962mbar. As shear remained low and the oceans remained warm, Helene intensified slightly more, peaking as a solid Category3 hurricane with 120mph (195km/h) winds early on September 18. At that time, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean. Operationally, Helene was estimated to have had 125mph (205km/h) winds, but the post-storm analysis downgraded it slightly. As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th, a narrow ridge built in, forcing Helene westward. The eyewall collapsed somewhat, and Helene weakened slightly to a Category2 hurricane, where it leveled off for about 48hours until September 20 due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern. On the 20th, Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened slightly due to <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in wind shear. That afternoon, it was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane, which Helene remained until becoming extratropical.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak strength, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Hurricane Sergio {{to intensify}} further to reach winds of 120mph (195km/h). Shortly after peaking, the hurricane {{turned to the}} north and gradually weakened as wind shear from an upper-level trough to its northwest increased. By early on November 17, the low-cloud circulation became partially exposed {{on the west side of}} the deep convection, and it is estimated that Sergio weakened to a tropical storm later that day. A ridge to its north and northeast turned the storm to the northwest and later to the west as Sergio gradually weakened. Deep convection reformed near the center on November 18, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>increase</b> in winds, though vertical shear quickly weakened it again. Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to land, about 225miles (360km) southwest of Michoacán. Early on November 20 it degenerated into a tropical depression, and later that day Sergio dissipated about 360miles (580km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, or about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of where it originally formed. The remnants of Sergio continued westward for about a day before the minimal amount of convection diminished.|$|E
