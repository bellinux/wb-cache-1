The young men who had invaded the meeting, much superior in numbers and strength to the speakers, to the large man, and {{the three or four}} other <b>able-bodied</b> <b>persons</b> who had rallied to them from among the audience, were taking every advantage of their superiority; and it went to Mr. Lavender's heart to see how they thumped and maltreated their opponents.

40|$|Stigma toward {{schizophrenia}} is {{an important}} area of research as it is frequently a barrier to early intervention. This study attempted to identify factors underlying stigma in Japan. Because even adolescents can develop schizophrenia, 357 Japanese parents {{of high school students}} were enrolled. All parents lived outside the areas affected by the Tohoku earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011 (ie, parts of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures). Factor analysis using the Link Devaluation–Discrimination Measure identified two factors: comparison with an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>person</b> and non-comparison with an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>person.</b> Regression analysis revealed that family structure had independent effects on factor 2 (p < 0. 05), and ANOVA showed that education had independent effects on factor 2 (p < 0. 05). These results suggest that education programs that seek to counteract stigma should target curricula in high schools and vocational schools...|$|R

Using specialized prostheses that he designed, he created prosthetic feet with high toe stiffness {{that made it possible}} to stand on small rock edges the width of a coin, and titanium-spiked feet that assisted him in ascending steep ice walls. He used these prostheses to alter his height to avoid awkward body positions and to grab hand and foot holds previously out of reach. His height could range from five to eight feet. As a result of using the prostheses, Herr climbed at a more advanced level than he had before the accident, making him the first person with a major amputation to perform in a sport on par with elite-level, <b>able-bodied</b> <b>persons.</b>|$|E

50|$|From its {{earliest}} beginnings {{to the present}} day, Adaptive Sports USA, has been directed and developed by wheelchair athletes and wheelchair sports enthusiasts themselves, individuals with a first-hand understanding {{to the values of}} participation. By and large, the needs of the athlete with a disability are not addressed by the vast network of athletic programs available to <b>able-bodied</b> <b>persons</b> through our educational system and community recreation agencies. Instead, the athlete with a disability has, with rare exceptions, developed his or her own resources and sports opportunities, from rules and governing structure (i.e., Adaptive Sports USA) to funding travel, equipment and other expenses of competition. Adaptive sports enthusiasts are involved at all levels of decision-making in the Adaptive Sports USA, and its constituent associations. Adaptive Sports USA, has remained essentially an all-volunteer organization, drawing on the energy and commitment of the people who also benefit from its programs. Adaptive sports have also been described as the most authentic of sports enterprises because the athletes compete and develop their own opportunities for the intrinsic values of participation - and not for the promise of professional contracts or financial reward. The dreams of individual athletes have been made possible through the efforts and dedication of pioneers such as Dr. Guttman and Lipton, and the countless other organizers, volunteers, friends, and supporters of adaptive sports throughout the United States {{and the rest of the}} world. With the continuing increase in public awareness, the future of adaptive athletic competition is indeed bright.|$|E

The embodied expertise not yet metacognitively verbalized by the disabled persons and the embodied expertise already transferred have and maintain a complementary relationship. 3) The embodied expertise not yet metacognitively verbalized by the disabled persons further accelerates the process of metacognitive verbalization of the embodied expertise of <b>able-bodied</b> <b>persons</b> through the intercorporeality between able-bodied and disabled persons...|$|E
40|$|Social welfare {{agencies}} worldwide {{are trying}} to bring physically disabled and <b>able-bodied</b> <b>persons</b> closer together by conducting joint leisure activities for members of both groups. This article reports on a study aimed at identifying the relationship between such locational activities {{and their impact on}} the social integration of physically disabled and <b>able-bodied</b> <b>persons,</b> as measured by the friendships they form and the frequency with which they meet outside the confines of the host agency. Based on a sample of 488 members of an NGO in Hong Kong, the major finding is that joint locational activities have a spill-over effect on able-bodied participants, but not on the physically disabled. It is recommended that similar programmes pay attention to people's motives for joining such activities and to their personal self image and level of participation - all of which were found to be positively related to social integration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
