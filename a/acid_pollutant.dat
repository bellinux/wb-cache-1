The adsorption capacity of an ACC is quantitatively improved {{in the presence of}} an electric field (electroadsorption process) reaching values of 96 % in comparison to 55 % in absence of applied potential. In addition, the cathodic treatment results in higher removal efficiencies than the anodic treatment. The enhanced adsorption capacity has been proved to be irreversible, since the removed compound remains adsorbed after switching the applied potential. The kinetics of the adsorption processes is also improved by the presence of an applied potential.

Although not considered a GHG, ammonia (NH 3) contributes to fine particular matter (PM) when combines with <b>acid</b> <b>pollutant</b> present in the atmosphere. Agriculture can be a sink of carbon (farmland) but it is also an important source of emissions. Agricultural soils are the main source of N 2 O while animals and manure storage are a great source on CH 4 and CO 2. Intensive dairy operations produce big volumes of manure loaded with nutrients such as (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that require careful management to minimize not only gaseous emissions but also leakage. Identifying the contribution of each source throughout the entire dairy operation as well as characterizing the manure nutrient content at different stages during management and treatment is the first step to implement mitigation strategies. Direct measurements can be expensive, time consuming and impractical while emission factors (EF) do not account for the effect of specific managements and local weather conditions. A model was developed to estimate GHG and NH 3 emissions and to track nutrients (C, N, P) in a dairy operation. The model includes the following components: animals, barn, lagoon, and anaerobic digester. Solid separation (SS) and nutrient recovery system (NR) were included due to the huge effect this processes have on manure characteristics and nutrient content. Model simulations of lagoon NH 3 emissions as well as NH 3 and CH 4 emissions from the barn were compared to data found in the literature and direct measurements from dairy lagoons in Pullman, WA and Moscow, ID with good results.

The abundant atmospheric <b>acid</b> <b>pollutants</b> (CO 2, NOx, SOx) can react with the mortars, causing partial dissolution of carbonate and sulphate based compounds (mainly of calcium).

40|$|The {{stability}} of glass {{is linked to}} its composition and the atmosphere controls its alteration. The organic pollutants emitted by wooden showcases {{play a role in}} the alteration of historic glasses. This study examines the effects of acetic acid, formic acid and formaldehyde on objects from the National Museums of Scotland and on replica glasses aged artificially, all with a soda silicate composition. Composition was determined by electron microprobe and analytical decomposition of the Raman spectra was used to establish correlations between glass structure and composition. This allowed interpretation of the structural variations between bulk and altered glass. The structure of the glasses altered by pollutants is characteristic of an alteration by selective leaching, with transformation of the silicates linked to alkali into silanols, which subsequently underwent condensation reactions to form a more polymerised structure. The SIMS concentration profiles of glass aged in artificial and real atmospheres were used to follow the alteration evolution as a function of time, humidity and pollutant concentration. The water film formed by the humidity at the surface and its acidity control the alteration by leaching of alkali and hydration of the glass. Formaldehyde does not act on the leaching reaction while acids accelerate and amplify it. In mixed polluted atmosphere, formates compounds always predominate in the film even at low formic acid concentration. The humidity and temperature fluctuations in museums maintain the leaching reaction. Knowledge of the harmful effect of organic <b>acid</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the alteration of soda silicate glasses will help improve their conservation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of capture of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from fossil fuel fired power plants on the {{emissions}} of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulphur oxides (SOX), which are <b>acid</b> gas <b>pollutants.</b> This was done by estimating the emissions of these three chemical species from natural gas combined cycle plants and pulverised coal plants, equipped with post-combustion carbon capture technology {{for the removal of}} CO 2 from their flue gases, and comparing them to the emissions of similar plants without CO 2 capture. The capture of CO 2 is not likely to increase the emissions of <b>acid</b> gas <b>pollutants</b> from individual power plants; on the contrary some NOX and SOX will also be removed during the process of capturing CO 2. The large-scale implementation of carbon capture is however likely to increase the emission levels of NOX from the power sector, due to the reduced efficiency of power plants equipped with carbon capture technologies and the need to maintain electricity generation. On the other hand SOX emissions from coal plants may be decreased significantly due to the need to reduce its concentration to very low levels to avoid significant losses of the chemicals that are used to capture CO 2. The increase in the quantity of NOXemissions will be however low, estimated at 5 % for gas plants and 19 % for coal plants or less, while the emissions of SOX from coal pfired plants will be reduced by as much as 92 % when at least 80 % of the CO 2 generated will be captured.

40|$|Desertification is the {{degradation}} of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas and it is primarily due to human activities and climatic variations. Nowadays, this matter does not refer only {{to the expansion of}} existing deserts but it occurs because dryland ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate changes, over-exploitation and inappropriate land use. In the Italian scenario, the impact of desertification is restricted to the southern regions where the risk is linked to water erosion, strong human aggressiveness, intense precipitations and to water and soil salinization. To this respect, the Italian project RIADE (Integrated Research for Applying new technologies and processes for combating DEsertification), has selected the area of Syracuse and the alluvial plain of the Licata town for an integrated application of the hydrogeochemical and spectroscopical methods in order to settle on qualitative characteristics of the water resources. Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy has been chosen for its intrinsic skills to be employed in real time water quality parameter determinations, with portable instruments during intensive monitoring campaigns. This technique allows to perform qualitative and quantitative in situ determination of dissolved (humic and fulvic <b>acids,</b> <b>pollutants)</b> or particulate (phytoplankton) organic matter.
