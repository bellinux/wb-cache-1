5000|$|Aperture and {{resolution}} {{effects on the}} data: in studying the structure and evolution of galaxies, the distribution of their mass, their stellar populations, and the gaseous content, {{it is very important}} that we can observed most of the extent of galaxies. Although this is routinely achieved with imaging techniques, it is much more difficult when observing with spectroscopic techniques. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, that has revolutionized for the last one and a half decades the study of the universe) only provides one spectrum per galaxy, covering the central 3 arcseconds. The currently ongoing IFS surveys, like MaNGA or SAMI, provide spatially resolved spectroscopy, but only out to a fraction of the extent of the galaxies. Thus, when reporting conclusions from the scientific analysis, it is important to take into account the possible biases introduced by a limited spatial coverage of the properties. CALIFA gives the community a unique opportunity to understand the aperture {{and resolution}} effects, because it provides a balanced combination of galaxy coverage (out to more than 2.5 effective radii), and spatial resolution (~1 kpc). We have explored the effects of the dilution of the signal in different gas and stellar population properties (Mast et al., 2014), which will be useful in the interpretation of the data provided by IFS surveys of lower spatial resolution. On the other hand, we have proposed an new empirical <b>aperture</b> <b>correction</b> for the SDSS data (Iglesias-Páramo et al., 2013, 2014), that will allow to re-calibrate the satr formation rate and chemical abundances derived from SDSS.|$|E

We focus on some indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiral galaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. We investigated 104 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey for which 2 D spectroscopy with complete spatial coverage is available. From the 3 D cubes we derived growth curves of the most conspicuous Balmer emission lines (H alpha, H beta) for circular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus after removing the underlying stellar continuum. We find that the H alpha flux (f(H alpha)) growth curve follows a well-defined sequence with aperture radius that shows a low dispersion around the median value. From this analysis, we derived <b>aperture</b> <b>corrections</b> for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift intervals. Once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, the f (H alpha) /f(H beta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing toward the absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. <b>Aperture</b> <b>corrections</b> {{as a function of the}} radius are provided in the interval [0. 3, 2. 5]R- 50.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} <b>aperture</b> <b>corrections</b> for {{emission}} lines {{in a sample}} of spiral galaxies from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey (CALIFA) database. In particular, we explore the behavior of the log([O III] lambda 5007 /H beta) /([N II] lambda 6583 /H alpha) (O 3 N 2) and log[N II] lambda 6583 /H alpha (N 2) flux ratios since they are closely connected to different empirical calibrations of the oxygen abundances in star-forming galaxies. We compute the median growth curves of Ha, H alpha/H beta, O 3 N 2, and N- 2 up to 2. 5 R(50) and 1. 5 disk R-eff. These distances cover most of the optical spatial extent of the CALIFA galaxies. The growth curves simulate the effect of observing galaxies through apertures of varying radii. We split these growth curves by morphological types and stellar masses to check if there is any dependence on these properties. The median growth curve of the Ha flux shows a monotonous increase with radius with no strong dependence on galaxy inclination, morphological type, and stellar mass. The median growth curve of the H alpha/H beta ratio monotonically decreases from the center toward larger radii, showing for small apertures a maximum value of approximate to 10 % larger than the integrated one. It does not show any dependence on inclination, morphological type, and stellar mass. The median growth curve of N- 2 shows a similar behavior, decreasing from the center toward larger radii. No strong dependence is seen on the inclination, morphological type, and stellar mass. Finally, the median growth curve of O 3 N 2 increases monotonically with radius, and it does not show dependence on the inclination. However, at small radii it shows systematically higher values for galaxies of earlier morphological types and for high stellar mass galaxies. Applying our <b>aperture</b> <b>corrections</b> to a sample of galaxies from the SDSS survey at 0. 02 <= z <= 0. 3 shows that the average difference between fiber-based and aperture-corrected oxygen abundances, for different galaxy stellar mass and redshift ranges, reaches typically to approximate to 11 %, depending on the abundance calibration used. This average difference is found to be systematically biased, though still within the typical uncertainties of oxygen abundances derived from empirical calibrations. Caution must be exercised when using observations of galaxies for small radii (e. g., below 0. 5 R-eff) given the high dispersion shown around the median growth curves.

TheWKBJ {{solution}} for the one-waywave equations in media with smoothly varying velocity variation with depth, c(z), is reformulated from the principle of en-ergy flux conservation for acoustic media. The formulation is then extended to general heterogeneous media with local angle domain methods by introducing the concepts of Transparent Boundary Condition (TBC) and Transparent Propagator (TP). The influ-ence of the WKBJ correction on image amplitudes in seismic imaging, such as depth migration in exploration seismology, is investigated in both smoothly varying c(z) and general heterogeneous media. We also compare {{the effect of the}} propagator ampli-tude compensation with the effect of the acquisition <b>aperture</b> <b>correction</b> on the image amplitude. Numerical results in a smoothly varying c(z) medium demonstrate that the WKBJ correction significantly improves the one-way wave propagator amplitudes, which, after compensation, agree very well with those from the full wave equation method.
