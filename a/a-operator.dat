40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} an associative algebra with a decomposition into the direct {{sum of the}} underlying vector spaces of another associative algebra and its dual space such {{that both of them}} are subalgebras and the natural symmetric bilinear form is invariant or the natural antisymmetric bilinear form is a Connes 2 -cocycle. The former is called a double construction of Frobenius algebra and the latter is called a double construction of Connes 2 -cocycle which is interpreted in terms of dendriform algebras. Both of them are equivalent to a kind of bialgebras, namely, antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras respectively. In the coboundary cases, our study leads to what we call associative Yang-Baxter equation in an associative algebra and D-equation in a dendriform algebra respectively, which are analogues of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Lie algebra. We show that an antisymmetric solution of associative Yang-Baxter equation corresponds to the antisymmetric part of a certain operator called <b>A-operator</b> which gives a double construction of Frobenius algebra, whereas a symmetric solution of D-equation corresponds to the symmetric part of an <b>A-operator</b> which gives a double construction of Connes 2 -cocycle. By comparing antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras, we observe that there is a clear analogy between them. Due to th...|$|E
40|$|We prove quasi-polynomiality for {{monotone}} and strictly monotone orbifold Hurwitz numbers. The second enumerative {{problem is}} also known as enumeration of a special kind of Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants or $r$-hypermaps. These statements answer positively two conjectures proposed by Do-Karev and Do-Manescu. We also apply the same method to the usual orbifold Hurwitz numbers and obtain a new proof of the quasi-polynomiality in this case. In {{the second part of the}} paper we show that the property of quasi-polynomiality is equivalent in all these three cases to the property that the $n$-point generating function has a natural representation on the $n$-th cartesian powers of a certain algebraic curve. These representations are the necessary conditions for the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. Comment: 31 pages.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the convergence properties of Lambda-acceleration methods for non-LTE radiative transfer problems in planar and spherical geometry. Matrix {{elements of the}} 'exact' <b>A-operator</b> are used to accelerate convergence to a solution in which both the radiative transfer and atomic rate equations are simultaneously satisfied. Convergence properties of two-level and multilevel atomic systems are investigated for methods using: (1) the complete Lambda-operator, and (2) the diagonal of the Lambda-operator. We find that the convergence properties for the method utilizing the complete Lambda-operator are significantly better {{than those of the}} diagonal Lambda-operator method, often reducing the number of iterations needed for convergence by a factor of between two and seven. However, the overall computational time required for large scale calculations - that is, those with many atomic levels and spatial zones - is typically a factor of a few larger for the complete Lambda-operator method, suggesting that the approach should be best applied to problems in which convergence is especially difficult...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} dependency-forming {{featural}} operation Agree and its {{interaction with the}} structure-building operation Merge in the local, derivational framework of Chomsky (2000). Chapter II develops a theory of cyclicity where individual instances of Merge can change the search-space of a probe. Such dynamic cyclicity is motivated from cyclic displacement phenomena where search-space expands downwards from one cycle to the next through evacuation of interveners, and the ergative displacement phenomenon in Basque where search-space expands upwards through cyclic construction of the phrase marker. Chapter III shows how Merge composes with Agree in the derivation to give both movement and copy-raising. The Merge step is constrained by the Agree step because Agree transmits the variable names needed to interpret movement in Heim & Kratzer (1998). Differences between movement and copy-raising reduce to the Binding Theory and copy-deletion in the result, forcing copies in local domains and pronouns in non-local domains. English tough-movement exemplifies copy-raising whose pronoun tail is an <b>Ä€-operator.</b> Chapter IV explores the ontology of Agree, departing from Chomsky (2000) where Agree in weak agreement languages manipulates features rather than atoms and has no furthe...|$|E
