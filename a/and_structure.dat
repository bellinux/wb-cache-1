Particular {{attention is focused on}} the basic methodological problems and shortcomings of modern "deformation" models. It is shown that in the most cases these problems can be solved by the generalized diagrams of reinforced concrete elements <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> real state. Thanks to these diagrams, the developed method: provides a single methodological approach to the calculation of reinforced concrete elements <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> normal sections for limit states; allows to reveal the internal static indeterminacy of heterogeneously deformable elements <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> in their ultimate limit state calculation; justifies the application of the basic and derived criteria of reinforced concrete elements <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> bearing capacity exhaustion; retains the essence of the physical processes of concrete <b>and</b> reinforced concrete <b>structures</b> deformation.

The best females receive the qualification Reproductive Recognised (in French Reproductrice Reconnue, abbreviated to RR), which is awarded to the top 10%, or Reproductive Recommended (in French Reproductrice Recommandée, abbreviated to RRE) awarded to the top 1%.

5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.

Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the surface.|$|E

These are “passive, ” “long-lived ” <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> components that {{are within the}} scope of license renewal. In addition, 10 CFR 54. 21 (a) (2) requires the applicant to describe and justify the methods used to identify these <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> components. The staff reviews the applicant’s methodology separately following the guidance in Section 2. 1. The applicant should provide {{a list of all the}} plant systems <b>and</b> <b>structures,</b> identifying those that are {{within the scope of}} license renewal. If the list exists elsewhere, such as in the UFSAR, it is acceptable to merely identify the reference. The license renewal rule does not require the identification of all plant systems <b>and</b> <b>structures.</b> However, providing such a list may make the review more efficient. On the basis of the DBEs considered in the plant’s CLB, and other CLB information relating to nonsafety-related systems <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> certain regulated events, the applicant would identify those plant-level systems <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> within the scope of license renewal, as defined in 10 CFR 54. 4 (a).

The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E

If municipal governance forms <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> influence accounting compliance, then understanding these relationships becomes important when discussing heterogeneous practice and efficient accounting regulation. The context and object of analysis is the practices of revenue recognition within the Swedish municipal solid waste management sector. Overall, this analysis identifies that financial accounting compliance is influenced by municipal governance forms <b>and</b> <b>structures,</b> <b>and</b> the results further highlight how financial accounting practices might diffuse through local intra-organisational processes. The results emphasise that municipal governance forms <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> are important factors when considering heterogeneous accounting practices in the municipal sector which complement the more conventional analysis of how external institutional, political and economic forces influence accounting choice and compliance...|$|R
