Military celebrities have been disguised and set at lowly occupations for dramatic effect, but I think McClintock is the first to send one of them to school.

6000|$|... "Nobody {{has heard}} of Davis: you may ask all <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will see. You never see his name {{mentioned}} in print, {{not even in}} advertisement; these things are of no use to Davis, not {{any more than they}} are to the wind and the sea. You never see one of Davis's books floating on top of the United States, but put on your diving armor and get yourself lowered away down and down and down till you strike the dense region, the sunless region of eternal drudgery and starvation wages--there you'll find them by the million. The man that gets that market, his fortune is made, his bread and butter are safe, for those people will never go back on him. An author may have a reputation which is confined to the surface, and lose it and become pitied, then despised, then forgotten, entirely forgotten--the frequent steps in a surface reputation. At surface reputation, however great, is always mortal, and always killable if you go at it right--with pins and needles, and quiet slow poison, not with the club and tomahawk. But it is a different matter with the submerged reputation--down in the deep water; once a favorite there, always a favorite; once beloved, always beloved; once respected, always respected, honored, and believed in. For, what the reviewer says never finds its way down into those placid deeps; nor the newspaper sneers, nor any breath of the winds of slander blowing above. Down there they never hear of these things. Their idol may be painted clay, up then at the surface, and fade and waste and crumble and blow away, there being much weather there; but down below he is gold and adamant and indestructible." ...|$|E

5000|$|Amnesiacs cover art {{was created}} by Yorke and the artist Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Radiohead since The Bends (1995). It depicts a weeping minotaur of Greek mythology. Donwood said the artwork was {{inspired}} by [...] "taking the train to London, getting lost and taking notes". Likening London to the mythological labyrinth, he saw the city as [...] "an imaginary prison, {{a place where you can}} walk <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> are the Minotaur of London, we are all the monsters, we are all half human half beast.

5000|$|In 1995, the {{progressive}} media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting accused Grant {{of racism and}} homophobia.

To me, that's a bad thing. I'm a white person". They highlighted his description of Haitian refugees as [...] "swine" [...] and [...] "sub-human infiltrators" [...] who multiply [...] "like maggots on a hot day" [...] and his comment that [...] "Ideally, {{it would have been nice}} to have a few phalanxes of policemen with machine guns and mow pride paraders down".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Vertigo, I was {{thinking}} about this awful nightclub we've all been to.

5000|$|Like {{previous}} single [...] "Jar of Hearts", [...] "Arms" [...] {{is built}} around a piano melody. Although the song [...] "packs a little less venom" [...] than Perri's lead single, it still lyrically contains the [...] "crazy" [...] lovesick emotions typically referred to Perri's style of music. The song begins as a slow love song and transgresses into an up-tempo track as kick-drums enter the song midway through. Lyrically, Perri begins the song in a happy tune, singing [...] "I never thought {{that you would be}} the one to hold my heart / You came <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> knocked me off the ground from the start." [...] More into the song, Perri begins to question the relationship, ultimately finding comfort as she ends the song repeating the hook. [...] "Arms" [...] progresses from a folky ballad to a nicely paced melodic love song, incorporating timpani drums.|$|E

5000|$|Summers {{are warm}} and shiny, whereas the winters are cold. The higher {{altitude}} regions of Dharchula (basically upper valleys) receives snow {{during the winter}} season (December to February end). The area also receives heavy rainfall {{during the rainy season}} (July-September) which disrupts the normal course of life of the people and often causes landslides in the mountain areas.The entire town looks beautiful during winters with snow-capped hills all <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{are in the middle of}} the valley. As the sun rises the snow starts melting and there are streams flowing down towards the river. These streams are all around and have a fixed path every year.Though exact record of when did it snow in the past is not known but in the year 2006 it snowed in the town and the entire town was under the cover of snow. It is said that it had snowed around 50 years back but there are no such pictures though.There is a warm water spring called [...] "doom pani" [...] which are clearly demarked for men and women. The woman folk go and wash their clothes there. There is also a very hot water spring at a place called Tapovan. During Shiv Ratri, people go to Tapovan and take a bath by mixing the hot water with the cold water from the river. It is a sulphur spring and known to be good for the skin.|$|E
5000|$|Writing {{about the}} rediscovery, Prof. Finlayson {{and his wife}} Dr. Geraldine Finlayson stated: [...] "Getting to the site was not easy even though we started with the {{advantage}} of being able to drive to a middle height on the Rock. This we did by obtaining permission to enter via the Waterworks. Mr Manolo Perez and his deputy, Mr Derek Cano, and their staff have always been most helpful to the Gibraltar Museum and this time was no exception. Having left the car {{on the west side of}} the Rock we walked the long and straight tunnel which leads to the huge reservoirs which hold Gibraltar's water supply. Some are the size of two football pitches and during the Second World War one of them housed the Blackwatch Regiment! The moment you enter this quarter-mile long tunnel you literally see the light at the other end. As you walk along it, on the tracks of a small railway system, the opening gets larger and the light brighter. Having got used to the darkness of the inner depths of the Rock you are suddenly confronted with the bright blue of the Mediterranean on the other side.The other side of the Rock is literally another world. Having got there the early morning sun, contrasting with the deep shade of the west side, is then quite warm and agreeable. You look <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see Catalan Bay below you and the slopes around are covered in a curious mix of introduced caHottentot Figs from South Africa used to stabilise the loose sands, Canary Palms, Tamarisks and native matorral dominated by Lentisc and Olive. The old corrugated sheets of the watercatchments were still prevalent in those early days of 1992.From the exit to the tunnel we walked south along a passage on the side of which was the channel which used to carry the rainwater into the reservoirs. Throughout the walk we would hear the rattle of stones as they fell onto the sheets from the cliffs above, perhaps disturbed by a gull landing, perhaps accomplices in the millennial process of erosion which, one day, will reduce the Rock to a flat land. We reached a point where we had to abandon the luxury of the passage and start to climb towards the cliff face. The steps here were narrow and a railing to hold onto was not always there. In fact, when there was it was so precarious that it was best not to hold on to it at all! The situation was not for one who suffered from vertigo. The higher we went the smaller Catalan Bay became below us. On either side of us we had corrugated iron sheets so to stumble would have meant a long fall down. A large Tamarisk half-way up right across the steps did little to help as we had to struggle through its branches to get to the other side.Eventually we conquered the 700 or so steps and reached a sandy platform which had been created by the workers as they removed the sand. We peered over the top and the view was surreal. We can only describe it as a small forest of tobacco plants that had spread and grown here. In the centre of this, then was a bulldozer, apparently taken up there in parts and assembled on site! There were lots of boulders. In many ways getting from here to the cave was the most dangerous part. The boulders were left-overs of the sand removal. Among them were remnants of rusty sheets so there was no guarantee of stability. The cave was a small opening on the cliff side. When we got to it we soon found some prehistoric stone tools and more bones on the surface and we were convinced that this was just the tip of the iceberg. It was at that moment that we knew we had to excavate here.The cave needed a name. No matter how much we debated we could not reach agreement. Our son, Stewart, then nine years old, stated the obvious - we had found the complete skull of an Ibex (wild mountain goat) so it should be called Ibex Cave. As parents we were not sure. Months later Andy Currant, in his inimical style settled it for us - Stewart named it Ibex Cave, here is the Ibex skull, therefore you must call it Ibex Cave! Who would argue? Two years later, in May 1994, we were digging..." ...|$|E
