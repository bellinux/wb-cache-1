The {{director}} of Media Content Tracking at the National Media Council explained: [...] "This movie is under our review <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there are many mistakes not only about Islam but other religions too. So, we will not release it in the UAE".|$|E

But before we could {{continue}} the war, {{it was necessary to}} analyze it to determine what its purpose was. We did this, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it had no purpose, except, perhaps, in terms of human needs. Even this was questionable.|$|E
60|$|We then {{spoke of}} the {{outlines}} of the story each had heard, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> in the main, our tales agreed. In making the comparison, however, I found that I was disposed to dwell most on the horrible features of the incidents, while Dus, gently and almost insensibly, yet infallibly, inclined to those that were gentler, and which had more connection with the affections.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Arnold continued. [...] "Now {{let me ask}} you to {{remember}} another evening, only last week, the night I dined with your brother. I brought you home from the Empire <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> your sitting-room had been entered from that same window.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a case study on “Co-Facilitator experience” of a basic {{encounter}} group. A facititator and a co-facilitator facilitated a basic encunter group (2 nights 3 days, 8 sessions, 19 hours, 6 members). We described the group structure and the group process of this group. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>founded</b> <b>that</b> the co-facilitator experienced the consciousness of “the facilitator consciousness”, the practice of “the facilitation action”, and “the observation learning” of the facilitator action.

60|$|We {{found it}} very {{difficult}} to make this decision. There were thousands of places where people went to camp out, but none of them seemed to be the place for us. Most of them were too far away. We figured up the cost of taking ourselves and our camp equipage to the Adirondacks, the lakes, the trout-streams of Maine, or any of those well-known resorts, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> we could not afford such trips, especially for a vacation of but fourteen days.|$|E

60|$|This trade held a good while, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> our {{customers}} came more from other islands {{than from the}} island where the governor resided; the reason of which, as we understood afterwards, was, because, as the governor had not openly granted a freedom of commerce, but privately winked at it, so they were not willing to carry it on openly before his face, or, as we say, under his nose; whereas, in other islands, they could convey their goods on shore with very little hazard, agreeing with the custom-house officer for a small matter.|$|E

60|$|We set out again, {{though not}} {{very early in}} the morning, having, as I said, sat up late, and drank freely over night, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found,</b> <b>that</b> after we had been gone to sleep it had rained very hard, and though the rain was over before we went out, yet the falling of the water from the hills made such a {{confused}} noise, and was echoed so backward and forward from all sides, that it was like a strange mixture of distant thunder, and though we knew the causes, yet it could not but be surprising to us for awhile.|$|E
60|$|Whilst I {{wondered}} {{where they might}} be, Oros, upon whose nerves this dread scene appeared to have no effect, {{and some of our}} attendant priests surrounded us and led us onwards by a path that ran perilously near to the rounded edge of the rock. A few downward steps <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> we were under shelter, for the gale was roaring over us. Twenty more paces and we came to a recess cut, I suppose, by man {{in the face of the}} loop, in such fashion that a lava roof was left projecting half across its width.|$|E
60|$|When the men {{had been}} placed in the two {{vehicles}} in which the police had come, the Chief and I made an examination of the premises, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the house had been entered by a kitchen window, in exactly the manner which the tall burglar had described. Outside of this window, close to the wall, we found a leathern bag, containing what the Chief declared to be an excellent assortment of burglars' tools. The officers and their prisoners now drove away, and we were left to a long morning nap, if we were so fortunate as to get it, and a late breakfast.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{approach}} of a mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probe {{has been demonstrated}} for the preparation of highly water-soluble and fluorescent TPP-conjugated carbon dots (TPP-CDs) derived from low-cost citric acid <b>and</b> urea. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the TPP-CDs are suitable for both one- and two-photon mitochondria-selective imaging in living cells...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} the particularities {{of the small}} collaboration we used an exploratory case study methodology. The case study followed an embedded case study design <b>and</b> <b>we</b> collected data via semi-structured interviews and the SDR’s logs. In the study, we explored three topics: the scientific collaboration process, the collaboration’s data-sharing practices <b>and</b> attitudes. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> {{on the topic of}} collaboration, the collaborations suffered the common problems of geographically distributed collaborations. In terms of data- sharing practices <b>and</b> attitudes, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> collaborators were solely motivated by extrinsic incentives. They showed a very restricted awareness of potential benefits, and sharing only occurred under low risk scenarios. We begin this section with the description of the exploratory study. We then present the results and a discussion of this exploration and propose three empirical claims...|$|R

60|$|The oxen rushed madly forward, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} away with us. No pulling at our rope-bridles had {{any effect on}} them.

My steed rushed into the water up to the neck, and stumbling as he did so, threw me {{into the middle of the}} pond, out of which I scrambled amidst the laughter of the whole party, who came up almost as soon as the oxen, so eager were they to drink.|$|E
60|$|We found {{those people}} clothed, {{generally}} speaking, over their whole bodies, their heads, arms, {{legs and feet}} excepted, but not so agreeably as those we mentioned above; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the clothing of these were generally made of the skins of beasts, but very artfully put together, so that though they had neither needle nor thread, yet {{they had the same}} plant as I mentioned before, the stalk of which would so strongly tie like a thread, that they peeled it off thicker or finer as they had occasion, and made use of it abundance of ways to tie and twist, and make their clothes with it, as well for their occasion {{as if it had been}} woven in a loom.|$|E
60|$|I shall say {{little about}} {{the first part of}} our voyage. We had the usual amount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling in the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of flying-fish dart {{out of the water and}} skim through the air about a foot above the surface. They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them; and one flying-fish, in its terror, flew over the ship, struck on the rigging, and fell upon the deck. Its wings were just fins elongated; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted into the air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea. Jack and I had it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Pendennis {{came away}} with rather a heavy heart from this party. She chose to {{interest}} herself about the right or wrong of her friends; and her mind was disturbed by the Colonel's vindictive spirit. On the subsequent day we had occasion to visit our friend J.

60|$|Early this morning, as we {{were rolling}} up our buffaloes and loading our boat amid the dew, while our embers were still smoking, the masons {{who worked at the}} locks, and whom we had seen {{crossing}} the river in their boat the evening before while we were examining the rock, came upon us as they were going to their work, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> we had pitched our tent directly in the path to their boat. This was the only time that we were observed on our camping-ground. Thus, far from the beaten highways and the dust and din of travel, we beheld the country privately, yet freely, and at our leisure. Other roads do some violence to Nature, and bring the traveller to stare at her, but the river steals into the scenery it traverses without intrusion, silently creating and adorning it, and is as free to come and go as the zephyr.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Erymanth entirely assented to this, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> he had {{all along}} held that his sister had been in error for not having {{remained}} at Killy Marey, and brought up her son to his duties as a landlord, whatever the danger; though of course she, poor thing, could hardly be expected {{to see it in}} that light. He evidently viewed this absenteeism as the cause of the wreck of Dermot's youth, and those desultory habits of self-indulgence and dissipation which were overcoming that which was good and noble in him; and the good old man showed that he blamed himself for what he had conceded to his sister in the first shock of her misfortune. Harold had told him of the warm feeling shown by the tenantry when Dermot was lying in danger of his life, and their rejoicing when he turned the corner and began to recover, and he asked anxiously whether all this affection might not awaken a responsive chord, and draw him to [...] "what was undoubtedly his proper sphere." ...|$|E
