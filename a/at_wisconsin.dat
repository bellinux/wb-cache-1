5|$|Kindt {{decided to}} forgo {{his senior season}} <b>at</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> {{in order to be}} {{eligible}} for the 1947 NFL Draft. He was selected with the last pick of the first round (eleventh overall) by the Bears despite having an history with injuries, and recovering from an off-season knee surgery he suffered while playing a basketball game <b>at</b> <b>Wisconsin.</b> After playing dual positions in his first few seasons with the Bears, Kindt was used primarily on defense for his last six seasons in the league. Considered to be a defensive standout during his playing career, Kindt was selected to participate in one Pro Bowl, and led the team in interceptions several times.|$|E
5|$|During {{the conference}} {{portion of the}} {{schedule}} Michigan won its first eight games, including a stretch of three games in which it defeated top-ten opponents in consecutive games (which no Division I team accomplished since the 2006–07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season). Michigan won <b>at</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> {{for the first time}} since 1999 and at Ohio State {{for the first time since}} 2003. The team defeated the same ranked opponent (Michigan State) twice in the same season for the first time in thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|Kindt {{forfeited}} {{his last}} year of eligibility <b>at</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> after the 1946 season {{to play in the}} National Football League. It was reported that the Chicago Bears had Kindt as its top player in their draft wish list. By the time the 1947 NFL Draft was held, the Bears managed to get Kindt with the eleventh overall pick. He soon signed a three-year contract at a reported $25,000 to play for head coach George Halas. After starting in a dual offensive/defensive role, Kindt decided to focus on playing only as a defensive back for the last few seasons of his career.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved to death on the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that {{at this point in the}} war he had every {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force <b>at</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Heights he was left with no choice but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{engagement}} <b>at</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Heights, the militia {{decided to wait}} until the following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox women and children who attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>Wisconsin,</b> {{he was a}} four–year starter at cornerback. He {{finished}} his career with a recovered fumble and 12 interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second–team All–Big Ten Conference honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared for the NFL Draft. He was drafted by the Titans and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured his leg and missed {{the rest of the}} season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with the Titans ended, he spent time with the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team.|$|E

On February 23 against (#13/14) Michigan State, Michigan rebounded from an early 22–11 deficit to win 79–70. Stauskas led the way with 25 points on 9-for-13 shooting and with 21 coming in the second half, including 10 that took the score from a 48–43 deficit to a 53–51 lead. It marked his first game with 9 made field goals. He added 5 assists, 3 rebounds and no fouls on his way to earning his third Big Ten Player of the Week recognition on February 24. On March 4, Stauskas had 24 points, including a career-high seven three point shots, as part of a 7-for-9 three point effort against Illinois to help Michigan clinch its 14th and 8th outright Big Ten Conference championship. On March 8, Stauskas had a team-high 21 points to help Michigan close out its season with a season-ending 84–80 victory over Indiana.
