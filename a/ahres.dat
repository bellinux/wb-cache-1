40|$|Activation of the aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) by 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin causes altered gene expression and toxicity. The AHR repressor (AHRR) inhibits AHR signaling through a proposed mechanism involving competition with AHR for dimerization with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and binding to AHR-responsive enhancer elements (<b>AHREs).</b> We sought to delineate the relative roles of competition for ARNT and <b>AHREs</b> in the mechanism of repression. In transient trans-fections in which AHR 2 -dependent transactivation was re-pressed by AHRR 1 or AHRR 2, increasing ARNT expression failed to reverse the repression, suggesting that AHRR inhibi-tion of AHR signaling does not occur through sequestration of ARNT.

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} frequent tachyarrhythmia in patients with a permanent pacemaker. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have a protective effect against the occurrence of AF in patients with heart diseases. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of olmesartan {{in the prevention of}} new-onset AF and AF burden in atrioventricular block (AVB) patients with dual-chamber (DDD) pacemaker implantation. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical study. A total of 116 AVB patients, who received DDD pacemakers implantation with the percentage of ventricular pacing (VP%) ≥ 40 % from April 22, 2011 to December 24, 2012, were prospectively randomized to olmesartan group (20 mg per day; n = 57) or control group (n = 59). Patients were followed up using pacemaker programming, 12 -lead electrocardiography in the intrinsic sinus rhythm, laboratory examinations, and transthoracic echocardiography at 24 months. Atrial high rate events (<b>AHREs)</b> were defined as 180 beats/min over a minimum of 5 min. AF burden was calculated by the number of hours with <b>AHREs</b> divided by the number of measurement hours. Results: Ten (17. 5 %) patients in the olmesartan group and 24 patients (40. 7 %) in the control group occurred new-onset AF, and the difference between two groups was statistically significant (P = 0. 04). AF burden was lower in olmesartan group than that in control group (8. 02 ± 3. 10 % vs. 13. 66 ± 6. 14 %, P = 0. 04). There {{were no significant differences in}} mean days to the first occurrence of <b>AHREs</b> and mean cumulative numbers of <b>AHREs</b> between two groups (P = 0. 89 and P = 0. 42, respectively). Moreover, olmesartan group had smaller values of maximal P-wave durations and P-wave dispersion (PD) after 24 months follow-up compared with the control group (109. 5 ± 7. 4 ms vs. 113. 4 ± 7. 1 ms, P = 0. 00; and 40. 6 ± 4. 5 ms vs. 43. 3 ± 4. 4 ms, P = 0. 02, respectively). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction were not significantly different between two groups (both P > 0. 05). Conclusion: This study suggested that 24 -month of olmesartan therapy could reduce new-onset AF and AF burden in patients with DDD pacemakers.

40|$|Contemporary {{pacemakers}} allow quantification of atrial high-rate episodes (<b>AHREs)</b> and {{atrial fibrillation}} burden (AFB) accurately. It is generally believed that left atrial (LA) remodelling may precede {{the development of}} atrial arrhythmias (AA), and AHRE precede the clinical manifestation of atrial flutter or fibrillation. However, the relationship between LA remodelling with AHRE has not been studied.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic impact of device-detected atrial high rate episodes (<b>AHRE),</b> as a surrogate for atrial fibrillation (AF). DESIGN: Data was retrospectively obtained from consecutive patients receiving CRT. Baseline clinical data and data from CRT device-interrogations, performed at a median of 12. 2 months after CRT-implantation, were evaluated with regard to prediction of the composite endpoint of death, heart transplant or appropriate shock therapy.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} and {{atrial flutter}} are common cardiac arrhythmias {{associated with an}} increased risk of stroke in patients with additional risk factors. Anticoagulation ameliorates stroke risk, but because these arrhythmias may occur intermittently without symptoms, initiation of prophylactic therapy is often delayed until electrocardiographic documentation is obtained. The IMPACT study is a multicenter, randomized trial of remote surveillance technology in patients with implanted dual-chamber cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices designed to test the hypothesis that initiation and withdrawal of oral anticoagulant therapy guided by continuous ambulatory monitoring of the atrial electrogram improve clinical outcomes by reducing the combined rate of stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding compared with conventional clinical management. For those in the intervention group, early detection of atrial high-rate episodes (<b>AHRE)</b> generates an automatic alert to initiate anticoagulation based on patient-specific stroke risk stratification. Subsequently, freedom from <b>AHRE</b> for predefined periods prompts withdrawal of anticoagulation to avoid bleeding.

The aim is the {{development}} of software engineering tools and CFD tools for conceptual design and optimisation of hybrid rocket engines (HRE). To provide high accuracy software tools, the <b>AHRES</b> program includes complex experiments with hybrid rocket engines in laboratory and prototype scale, for pressures up to 70 bars. For this purpose an existing test facility at the DLR site Trauen (former EUROPA 2 upper stage test range) was enhanced, in order to conduct tests with a HRE. In this paper a short description of the operational test bed is given, which is equipped with sophisticated measurement techniques. The HRE test bed is currently equipped with oxidiser supply systems for high-test peroxide (HTP) and gaseous oxygen. The solid fuel grains are based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) mixed with different metallic additives to improve the performance. Currently conducted tests are aimed to characterise the HRE’s combustion processes and to generate an experimental database to develop the above mentioned simulation tools. Based on experimental test data, calculations on developed simulation tools and literature sources a comparison of the HRE with solid and storable liquid rocket engines is made. To illustrate one possible application of a HRE in near-future a HRE which could be applied as an upper stage is designed and compared with existing solid rocket engines. For the comparison the third stage “Zefiro 9 A” of the VEGA launcher is taken. The preliminary results and conclusions are presented, including specific impulse, combustion and engine efficiency, as well as the achievable regression rate dependent on fuel composition. The last factor is of tremendous importance to determine the achievable thrust level of a hybrid rocket engine. This again, determines whether a HRE might be promising for the application as an upper stage. The results are presented graphically, in table form, analysed, and commented. ...|$|E

40|$|Metal powders as fuel {{ingredients}} of {{hybrid rocket motors}} are an important factor which can improve the engine properties. Through the fuel density increase, a compact engine form can be achieved and the construction mass ratio can be reduced. Furthermore, the addition of metal powders in the fuel structure can increase the regression rate, the combustion temperature and the corresponding specific impulse. But to achieve these goals, the combustion efficiency of metal particles must be high and the condensation of metal droplets, high particle agglomeration, the combustor wall slagging {{as well as the}} nozzle structure abrasion must be reduced or completely avoided. The challenging experiments with hybrid rocket engines (HRE) deliver a limited amount of information necessary to understand transformation mechanisms, despite of the application of sophisticated measurement techniques. So, the experiments should be combined with CFD multiphase simulations to enable understanding of combustion processes related to the condensed flow phase. Subsequently, this enables the management of the combustion process within HRE as well as the avoidance of negative effects by the application of powder ingredients with metal content. Within the <b>AHRES</b> (Advanced Hybrid Rocket Engine Simulation) program, the DLR Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology in Braunschweig has carried out experiments with different fuel formulations, which included metal powders of aluminum and aluminum-magnesium alloys. Additionally, the transformation loop of small particles with metal content is simulated using an Euler-Lagrange coupling of the reacting gas flow and the condensed metallic phase. The conducted simulation includes time dependent transformations of Al and AlH 3 particles (decomposition, melting, vaporization, heterogeneous combustion, condensation and solidification). In this paper, the used transformation models and the coupling procedure between the gas and the condensed phase are classified and explained.

40|$|AbstractRepetitive non-reentrant ventriculo-atrial {{synchrony}} (RNRVAS) is a pacemaker-induced arrhythmia {{that must}} be distinguished from atrial fibrillation (AF). Pacemaker-induced arrhythmias are commonly detected as atrial high rate episodes (<b>AHRE)</b> by implanted cardiac devices. Two main types of atrial oversensing are recognized: far-field R-wave (FFRW) oversensing and pacemaker-induced arrhythmias, which include pacemaker-mediated tachycardia and RNRVAS. The presence of ventriculo-atrial conduction is required for both types of pacemaker-induced arrhythmias. The incidence of RNRVAS can increase {{with the use of}} various device settings and functions, such as long atrioventricular (AV) interval programming, the rate-adaptive mode, and the atrial overdrive pacing algorithm.

Most of these episodes are of short duration, often lasting only seconds to minutes and are called atrial high-rate episodes (<b>AHRE)</b> to distinguish them from the longer episodes of overt AF. To understand properly the clinical importance of asymptomatic AF, a large study of pacemaker patients without clinically overt AF is required.

We find that treatment of mouse hepatoma Hepa- 1 cells with 2 -aminopurine, an inhibitor of protein kinase activity, inhibits CYP 1 A 1 mRNA induction by TCDD as well as the concomitant increase in CYP 1 A 1 enzyme activity. Formation of DNA-protein complexes between the Ah receptor and its AhRE target is also inhibited by 2 -aminopurine, as determined by gel mobility shift assays. Phosphorylation is required for the formation of Ah receptor-specific complexes, since in vitro dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts from TCDD-treated Hepa- 1 cells abolishes the capacity of the Ah receptor to form specific complexes with its cognate AhRE sequences. To determine whether any one of several known protein kinases was involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Cyp 1 a- 1 gene, we treated Hepa- 1 cells with nine other protein kinase inhibitors prior to induction with TCDD; nuclear extracts from these cells were analyzed for their capacity to form specific DNA-protein complexes. Only extracts from cells treated with staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, were unable to form these complexes. In addition, staurosporine completely inhibited CYP 1 A 1 mRNA induction by TCDD. Depletion of protein kinase C by prolonged treatment with phorbol ester led to the complete suppression of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA induction by TCDD. We conclude that (i) phosphorylation is necessary for the formation of a transcriptional complex and for transcriptional {{activation of}} the Cyp 1 a- 1 gene; (ii) the phosphorylation site(s) exists on at least one of the proteins constituting the transcriptional complex, possibly the Ah receptor itself; and (iii) the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation is likely to be protein kinase C...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac pacing {{has been}} the only {{effective}} treatment in the management of patients with symptomatic bradycardia caused by sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block for decades. Conventional dual-chamber pacing is performed by implanting two leads in right atrial (RA) appendage and right ventricular (RV) apex separately. RV apex is the most commonly applied pacing site because it can be easily reached and allows a chronically stable position and stimulation thresholds. However, large randomized clinical trials have suggested that right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing may cause abnormal ventricular contraction and reduce pump function and lead to myocardial hypertrophy, in particular in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function. Recent studies have also reported a reduced LV systolic function in patients with pacing indications and preserved ejection fraction. The deleterious effects of RVA pacing on LV function {{may be related to the}} abnormal electrical and mechanical activation pattern or ventricular dyssynchrony. During RVA pacing, conduction of the electrical wave front propagates slowly through ventricular myocardium rather than through the His-Purkinje conduction system, comparable to left bundle branch block (LBBB). In addition, RVA pacing alters ventricular synchrony and loading conditions which may result in diastolic heart failure with abnormal LV relaxation, high filling pressure and low cardiac output state. Furthermore, it is possible that left atrial (LA) remodeling and reduction of atrial function may occur during RVA pacing. However, it is not been carefully studied. Echocardiography is a convenient, non-invasive and established tool to assess cardiac function in clinical practice. Conventional two-dimensional echocardiography is useful to assess cardiac chamber size, volume and function. With the development of real time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT 3 DE) and color tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), echocardiography provides further valuable information and more accurate measurements which include myocardial velocity and parameters of dyssynchrony. In the present study, the main echocardiographic parameters including the maximal left atrial volume (LAVmax), pre-atrial contraction volume (LAVpre) and the minimal left atria l volume (LAVmin) were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Peak systolic (Sm-la), peak early diastolic (Em-la), peak late diastolic (Am-la) velocities of left atrium (LA) and atrial conduction time (from onset of P wave on electrocardiogram to onset of atrial velocity) were measured by TDI. In a cross-sectional study, ninety-eight patients who had been implanted with RVA-based dual-chamber pacemakers were enrolled. Four patients with pacing dependent were excluded. Eventually 94 patients were included in the final analysis. Echocardiography was performed (iE 33, Philips) during intrinsic ventricular conduction (V-sense) and RVA pacing (V-pace) modes with 15 minutes between switching modes. We aimed to investigate if RVA pacing has any acute effects on atrial remodeling and function in patients with preserved ejection fraction (LV ejection fraction> 45 %). The result showed that during V-pace, LA volumes increased significantly when compared with V-sense (LAVmax: 52. 0 +/- 18. 8 vs. 55. 2 +/- 21. 1 ml, p = 0. 005; LAVpre: 39. 8 +/- 16. 4 vs. 41. 3 +/- 16. 6 ml, p = 0. 014; LAVmin: 27. 4 +/- 14. 0 vs. 29. 1 +/- 15. 1 ml, p = 0. 001). TDI parameters showed significant reduction in Sm-la (3. 0 +/- 1. 1 vs. 2. 7 +/- 0. 9 cm/s, p 15 at one year and reduction of LV ejection fraction ≥ 5 % were independent predictors of reduction of Am-la > 30 %; (c) high percent of RA appendage pacing prolonged atrial conduction and induced intra- and interatrial dyssynchrony. (d) Am-la < 5. 3 cm/s can predict <b>AHREs</b> burden which had a sensitivity of 71 % and specificity of 75 %. In conclusion, our studies suggest even short-term RVA pacing induces LA dilatation and impaired passive atrial function, though it did not have direct effect on active atrial contractility. However, chronic RVA pacing results in LA remodeling and reduces atrial function with decreased contractility. This was more likely to occur in those with impaired LV ejection fraction and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Atrial dysfunction and interatrial dyssynchrony can predict <b>AHREs</b> burden after chronic RVA pacing. Therefore, measures that may minimize such adverse effect of pacing on atrial function need to considered for patients receiving RVA pacing, such as the use of new pacing modalities. Xie, Junmin.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{predictors of}} asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients older than 70 years with complete atrioventricular (AV) block, normal left ventricular systolic function, and implanted dual chamber (DDD) pacemaker. METHODS: Hundred and eighty six patients with complete AV block were admitted over {{one year to}} the Sisters of Mercy University Hospital. The study recruited patients older than 70 years, with no history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or reduced left ventricular systolic function. All the patients were implanted with the same pacemaker. Out of 103 patients who were eligible for the study, 81 (78 %) were evaluated. Among those 81 (78 %) were evaluated. Eighty one (78 %) patients were evaluated. Follow-up time ranged from 12 to 33 months (average +/-standard deviation 23 +/- 5 months). Primary end-point was asymptomatic atrial fibrillation occurrence recorded by the pacemaker. Atrial fibrillation occurrence was defined as atrial high rate episodes (<b>AHRE)</b> lasting > 5 minutes. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of development of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation. Results. The 81 patients were stratified into two groups depending on the presence of <b>AHRE</b> lasting > 5 minutes (group 1 had AHRE> 5 minutes and group 2 <b>AHRE</b> 5 minutes were detected in 49 (60 %) patients after 3 months and in 53 (65 %) patients after 18 moths.

50|$|The {{classical}} recognition {{motif of}} the AhR/ARNT complex, {{referred to as}} either the AhR-, dioxin- or xenobiotic- responsive element (<b>AHRE,</b> DRE or XRE), contains the core sequence 5’-GCGTG-3’ within the consensus sequence 5’-T/GNGCGTGA/CG/CA-3’ in the promoter region of AhR responsive genes. The AhR/ARNT heterodimer directly binds the AHRE/DRE/XRE core sequence in an asymmetric manner such that ARNT binds to 5’-GTG-3’ and AhR binding 5’-TC/TGC-3’. Recent research suggests that a second type of element termed AHRE-II, 5’-CATG(N6)CT/ATG-3’, is capable of indirectly acting with the AhR/ARNT complex. Regardless of the response element, {{the end result is}} a variety of differential changes in gene expression.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionMore {{and more}} frequently, silent atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) events are detected in intracardiac electronic device (ICED) memory (“infraclinical AF” or “had atrial high rate events AHRE”). In MOST trial, <b>AHRE</b> {{were seen in}} almost 50 % of patients treated for sinus node dysfunctionand were {{associated with an increased}} risk of stroke (1. 69 % per year if CHADS score> 2) in ASSERT study. Nevertheless currently there are no antithrombotic recommendations for these patients. We tried to describe the different therapeutic alternatives in usual practice. Materials and methods: We started a prospective registry of patients with silent AF detected in DDD or CRT PMK/ICD of all constructors. Inclusion criteria were: age > 18 y, <b>AHRE</b> diagnosed by device algorithms and > 6 minutes duration, confirmation by atrial endocavitary electrogram. We excluded patients with a previous history of “clinical AF”or valvular AF. The antithrombotic strategy was decided by the referent physician. ResultsFrom November 2013 to May 2014, 43 patients were included. The median age was 77 years old. 26 patients (60 %) had a DDD PMK (10 for sinus node dysfunction (23 %), 15 for AV block (35 %), 1 for obstructive CMP), 10 patients (23 %) a DDD ICD (6 (14 %) for primary prevention and 4 (9 %) for secondary prevention) and 7 patients a CRT-D (16 %). The median CHADS 2 score was 2, the median CHADS 2 VASCscore was 4 (mean respectively 2. 36 and 3. 56) : 5 patients had a history of embolic event (11 %). Only 28 patients (65 %) were on anticoagulation therapy: 15 (35 %) antivitamin K and 13 (30 %) new oral anticoagulants. 10 patients (23 %) received aspirin and 5 patients the association aspirin/clopidogrel (11 %). 2 patients did not receive any antithrombotic treatment. There were no difference in CHADS and CHADSVASC scores between patients treated or not with anticoagulants (respectively p= 0. 21 and p = 0. 57) ConclusionMost of patients in this study received an anticoagulation therapy as a stroke prevention strategy.

40|$|Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), a major {{component}} of green tea, protects against certain types of cancers, although the mechanism has not yet been determined. It was previously demonstrated that EGCG blocks aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) -mediated transcription induced by the potent carcinogen 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Unlike other AhR antagonists that directly bind to the AhR, EGCG inhibits AhR-mediated transcription by binding to hsp 90. We hypothesize that EGCG exerts anti-AhR and anti-cancer effects by acting as an hsp 90 inhibitor. Using proteolytic footprinting, immunoprecipitation, and an ATP-agarose pull-down assay, EGCG was found to directly modulate the conformation of hsp 90 and bind at or near to a C-terminal ATP binding site. Hsp 90 chaperone function, as assessed by its ability to mediate refolding of denatured luciferase, was inhibited by EGCG treatment. Hsp 90 dimerization, which occurs at the C-terminal end, was also inhibited by EGCG treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that EGCG stabilizes an AhR complex that includes hsp 90 and XAP 2 (hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2), and decreases the association of aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) with ligand-activated AhR. Thus, EGCG, through its ability to bind to hsp 90, blocks AhR response element (<b>AhRE)</b> recognition. These studie...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of several {{environmental}} chemicals on the transient expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) reporter gene linked to the promoter sequences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Aflatoxin B 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin) and benzo[a]pyrene cause a significant increases in CAT expression in mouse hepatoma Hepa- 1 cells. The induction of CAT after TCDD treatment is abolished by administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine or 2 -mercaptoethanol and does not {{take place in a}} mutant cell line that lacks CYP 1 A 1 enzymatic activity. Linker-scanning mutational analysis of transcription factor binding sites in the promoter revealed that both the NF kappa B and an adjacent aromatic hydrocarbon response element (<b>AhRE)</b> are required for TCDD-dependent CAT expression. In addition, mutation of the NFAT/AP- 1 binding sites in the negative regulatory region of the promoter increases the magnitude of the TCDD effect. We conclude that induction of a functional CYP 1 A 1 monooxygenase by TCDD stimulates a pathway that generates thiol-sensitive reactive oxygen intermediates which, in turn, are responsible for the TCDD-dependent activation of genes linked to the LTR. These data might provide an explanation for findings that TCDD increases infectious HIV- 1 titers in experimental systems and for epidemiologic reports suggesting that exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons, such as found in cigarette smoke, is associated with an acceleration in AIDS progression...|$|R
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates {{the effects of the}} environmental contaminant 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Recently, AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability tomodulate estrogen receptor-a (ERa) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation. Our previous studies identified cyclinG 2 (CCNG 2), an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression, as an AHR target gene; however, the mechanism of this regulation is unknown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T- 47 D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR, nuclear co-activator 3 (NCoA 3) and the transcription factor forkhead box A 1 (FOXA 1), a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling, toCCNG 2 resulting in increases inCCNG 2 mRNA and protein levels. Mutation of the AHR response element (<b>AHRE)</b> and forkhead-binding sites abolishedTCDD-inducedCCNG 2 -regulated reporter gene activity. RNA interference–mediated knockdown of FOXA 1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA 3 to CCNG 2 and reduced CCNG 2 mRNA levels. Interestingly, knockdown of FOXA 1 also caused a marked decrease in ERa, but not AHR protein levels. However, RNA interference–mediated knockdown of ERa, a negative regulator of CCNG 2, had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA 3 recruitment to or expression ofCCNG 2. These findings show that FOXA 1, but not ERa, is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG 2, assigning a role for FOXA 1 in AHR action. Mol Cancer Res; 10 (5); 636 – 48. 2012 AACR...|$|R
40|$|Zu den Ährenschädlingen am Winterweizen zählen die Gelbe Weizengallmücke (C. tritici (Kirby)) und die Orangerote Weizengallmücke (S. mosellana (Géhin)) (Holland & al., 1996). In Abhängigkeit vom Befallsstadium der Weizenähre und der Biologie der Erreger sind folgende Schadsymptome bekannt: Verminderung der Kornzahl pro <b>Ähre</b> (C. tritici) bzw. geschrumpfte oder missgebildete Körner (S. mosellana) (Mölck, 2006). Der Saatgutwert wird beeinträchtigt und die Backqualität beeinflusst (Miller & Halton, 1961). Hinsichtlich Prognose und Überwachung des Auftretens von Weizengallmücken gab es bisher keine praxistauglichen methodischen Ansätze im Bundesland Sachsen-Anhalt. Hinzu kommt, dass der derzeit verstärkt praktizierte pfluglose Anbau von Weizen nach Weizen ein höheres Befallsrisiko erwarten lässt. Mit der Identifikation von Sexualpheromonen, die als hoch attraktiv für Männchen von S. mosellana gelten (Gries & al., 2000), eröffnen sich nun neue Prognosemöglichkeiten. Die effektive Nutzung von Pheromonfallen zum Monitoring von Gallmücken könnte somit ein erster Baustein zur Erarbeitung praxistauglicher Richtwerte darstellen. In einer zweijährigen Testphase wurde in Zusammenarbeit mit der Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau geprüft, ob die Pheromonfallen eine Gradationswahrscheinlichkeit der Problemschädlinge, insbesondere in Risikofruchtfolgen signalisieren können. Die Ergebnisse sowie Daten zu weiteren Überwachungsansätzen werden präsentiert. Lemon wheat blossom midges (Contarinia tritici) and Orange wheat blossom midges (Sitodiplosis mosellana) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) {{belong to}} the most {{prominent}} insect pests in winter wheat (Holland & al., 1996). However, no practical method exists to predict or monitor {{the impact of these}} insect pests. There is also a lack of recent research on the issue particulary for Central Germany (older studies include: Lübke & Wetzel, 1984, Volkmar & 1989). Consequently, this study attempts to provide new data on the occurrence, monitoring and crop damage of wheat blossom midges. It also focuses on the impact of changing agricultural conditions such as wheat-to-wheat crop rotation, reduced soil tillage or different crop variants. A systematic survey of midge occurrence and crop damage in a wheat-to-wheat crop rotation was carried out at a research field (variants: Elvis, Altos in 2005) and conventional winter wheat fields in 2006 (variant Tommi). S. mosellana were monitored by means of pheromone traps. In 2006, white traps were tested as an alternative method to collect data on S. mosellana and C. tritici. Flight activity of adult midges was monitored on 13 different dates (Tab. 1). Crop damage was evaluated on 8 dates (Tab. 2). A total of 50 spikes per variant and date were randomly selected for microscopical examination. The analysis included parameters such as number of larvae per infested seed, number of corn thrips (larvae and adults) per spike or number of infested seeds per spike. In 2005, the activity of adult S. mosellana reached its peak in the phenological growth stage of full flowering (BBCH 65 - 69). The activity density was higher in the Elvis variant with 260 midges per trap (monitoring until mid-flowering) as compared to the Altos variant with 89 midges per trap (monitoring until the end of flowering period). In 2006, the activity of adult S. mosellana reached its peak in BBCH 51 (beginning of heading) with 246 midges per trap (Tommi variant). In 2005 the highest abundance of larvae per ear was established for BBCH 75 with an average of 2. 1 (Altos) and 1. 6 (Elvis). In 2006 these numbers were significantly higher. In the Tommi variant, an average of 14. 3 larvae per ear was reached during BBCH 70 - 73. The ratio of midge-damaged kernels was evaluated in 2005 on BBCH 80 - 85 with 6. 3 % (Altos) and 4. 4 % (Elvis), while in 2006 a ratio of 23. 5 % was reached in the Tommi variant. The results suggest that the intensity of crop damage depends on the correlation of two factors. The closer the activity peak of midges correlate with the sensitive wheat growth stage of heading (BBCH 50 - 59), the higher the crop damage. This is highlighted by the results of 2006 in the Tommi variant. In other cases, S. mosellana reached its activity peak much later (in 2005 during BBCH 65 - 69, resp. in 2006 on BBCH 73 - 75) and the ensuing crop damage was significantly smaller. In conclusion, the results of this survey in Central Germany stress the influence of changing agricultural conditions and regional cultivation concepts. They also recommend further studies that cover several years in open habitats...|$|R
