5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark explorations {{of the self}} ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, follow-up The Fragile, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when Voltaire wrote Candide, but {{scholars}} estimate {{that it was}} primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire {{is believed to have}} written a portion of it while at his house in Ferney and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote Candide in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work La Vie intime de Voltaire aux Délices et à Ferney by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise Candide, but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. Candide is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> myth might suggest.|$|E

Likewise, some aspects of Hatofuls narrative reference real world events, media, or people: the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game's post-apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease, most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic; depictions of Hitchcock's Winter, the in-universe war between humans and birds, bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds; and Operation Carneades—the codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe—was named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of his thought experiments, the Plank of Carneades.|$|E
