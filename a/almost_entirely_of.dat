5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} preface and Francatelli's advice on serving wine, {{the body of}} the book {{consists}} <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> recipes without any kind of introduction. There is no guidance on choice of kitchenware or advice on the layout of the kitchen.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is noted}} for its practicality, departing from earlier {{practice}} in avoiding plagiarism, consisting instead <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> direct instructions based on Raffald's experience. It introduced the first known recipe for a wedding cake covered in marzipan and royal icing, and is an early use of barbecue. The book remains a reference for cookery writers.|$|E
5|$|The group later {{noticed that}} tablet K {{was a close}} {{paraphrase}} of the recto of G. Kudrjavtsev wrote up their findings, which were published posthumously.

5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was used as}} a follow-up instrument for possible SETI detections made at Arecibo between 1998 and the end of 2003. No signals were detected. In February 2005, astronomers using the Lovell Telescope discovered the galaxy VIRGOHI21 that appears to be made <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> dark matter.|$|E
5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed {{much of the}} Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the {{television}} series Dante's Cove premiered on the here! cable station. The series included both {{gay and lesbian}} couples dealing with supernatural situations in the coastal town of the same name. The following year, Syfy premiered the series Eureka.

5|$|John Edward Brownlee {{served as}} Attorney-General of the {{province}} of Alberta in western Canada from 1921 until 1926, in the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) government of Herbert Greenfield. As Brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> farmers, his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorney-general, and ranged from providing legal advice to explaining {{how to write a}} business letter; he also became the government's de facto leader in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> water ice. However, {{based on the}} effects of Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined to be much higher than previously thought, yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E
5|$|Once protogalaxies {{began to}} form and contract, the first halo stars (called Population III stars) {{appeared}} within them. These were composed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen and helium, {{and may have been}} massive. If so, these huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel and became supernovae, releasing heavy elements into the interstellar medium. This first generation of stars re-ionized the surrounding neutral hydrogen, creating expanding bubbles of space through which light could readily travel.|$|E

5|$|Others fled {{and went}} into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Quiñones; he was {{captured}} and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> native-born Puerto Ricans, and also the Compañia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} an object is a rough guide to its composition: the lower the density, the higher the {{fraction}} of ices, and the lower the fraction of rock. The n denser objects, Vesta and Juno, are composed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> rock with very little ice, and have a density close to the Moon's, while the less dense, such as Proteus and Enceladus, are composed mainly of ice.|$|E
5|$|The early {{population}} {{of the city was}} composed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>of</b> soldiers and their families, and the layout of the city was similar to that of a garrison. Amr intended for Fustat to serve as a base from which to conquer North Africa, as well as to launch further campaigns against Byzantium. It remained the primary base for Arab expansion in Africa until Qayrawan was founded in Tunisia in 670.|$|E
