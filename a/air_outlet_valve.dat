50|$|Valve and Pump SystemsThe {{main parts}} which {{are part of}} the {{pressure}} modulation system are solenoid inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves,</b> a pump, motor and accumulators/reservoirs.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{backward}} flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total number of passive check valves, by means of changing the inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> valvesâ€™ configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing {{results show that the}} optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66 % and less than 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the number of inlet valves in one kind of configuration is {{the same as that of}} <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the number of inlet valves or the number of <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase of either inlet <b>valves</b> or <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue of check valves often occur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The author {{finds that}} there is outflow during {{piezoelectric}} pump sucking process, and a dynamic model combined with hydrodynamics and mechanical vibration is presented for the anlysis of piezoelectric pump sucking process phenomenon. The model is utilized to study the reason of sucking process outflow {{and the effect of}} the driving frequency, <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> rigidity, the load in inlet and outlet on the sucking process outflow. The result turns out that the flow inertia is the cause of sucking process outflow; the inertial flow also exists during draining process as the sucking process; increasing driving frequency, or <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> rigidity, the inertial flow decreases, increasing the load in inlet and outlet has the same effect. The research makes it clear that the pump output flow should include two parts, bulk flow and inertial flow, which will provide theory reference for the precise flow control of piezoelectric pump...|$|R
