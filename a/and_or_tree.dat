40|$|The {{problem of}} provable optimal {{synthesis}} of boolean functions {{for a given}} technology is still unsolved. In this paper we present {{a new approach to}} the synthesis of combinational circuits and the mapping of standard cells with arbitrary number of inputs. Our method is based on the provable optimal synthesis of the fanoutfree regions of a circuit, represented as Normal <b>AND</b> <b>OR</b> <b>Trees.</b> This representation enables TROY to rebalance the regions with respect to delay without sacrifying area and result in a larger search space than that used by Tree Matching. Fast heuristics derived from the optimal approach yield significantly better results than SIS on many standard benchmark circuits. 1 Introduction Until today the optimal synthesis of arbitrary boolean functions for a given technology is impossible and the problem {{is not likely to be}} solved. Known synthesis procedures generate a boolean network by algebraic factorization ([1]) <b>or</b> transformation ([5]) <b>and</b> implement it for a given technol [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Living {{sculpture}} is {{any type}} of sculpture that is created with living, growing grasses, vines, plants <b>or</b> <b>trees.</b> It can be functional and/or ornamental. There are several different types of living sculpture techniques, including topiary (prune plants or train them over frames), sod works (create sculptures using soil <b>and</b> grass <b>or</b> moss), <b>tree</b> shaping (growing designs with living trees) and mowing and crop art (create patterns or pictures with plants or in lawns). Most living sculpture technique requires horticultural skills, such as grafting or pruning, to create the art.|$|R
