40|$|Without {{significant}} price reduction, high consumer switching {{rates to}} competitive power suppliers {{have been criticized}} {{as a result of}} either the artificially high price to compare (PC) acting as the benchmark price that competitive generators must meet, or the critical mass effect from switching consumers. This paper builds a simple model to explore how the restructuring policy determines residential switching behavior. When the PC increases over time, whether it reflects the rising wholesale price adequately or not, a consistent price reduction policy will naturally induce an early-stage high switching rate. In contrast, a required switching rate policy that is associated with both an artificial price cut at the early stage and a longer period of stranded cost recovery can <b>accelerate</b> <b>switching</b> effectively. Two high-cost Pennsylvania utilities, which demonstrate opposite movements of residential switching rate under different restructuring policies, are examined to confirm that the high switching rate just results from the policy design, not from the subsidy in PC discussed in (Joskow, Paul L. “Why Do We Need Electricity Retailers?

40|$|Nowadays users {{expect and}} demand highly {{dependable}} network connectivity and services. However, several recent episodes demonstrate that software errors and operator mistakes continue to cause undesired disruptions and outages. It {{is crucial to}} have reliable networks, and this requirement does not change with Software Defined Networking (SDN). Unfortunately, as the network programmability enhances and software plays {{a greater role in}} it, risks that buggy software may disrupt an entire network also increase. The centralized programming model, where a single controller program manages the network, seems to reduce the likelihood of bugs. However, the system is inherently distributed and asynchronous, with events happening at different switches and end hosts, and inevitable delays affecting communication with the controller. This extended abstract presents an overview of efficient, systematic techniques for testing the SDN software stack at both its highest and lowest layer. That is, our testing techniques target at the top layer, the OpenFlow controller programs (Section 1) and, at the bottom layer, the OpenFlow agents (Section 2) —the software that each switch runs to enable remote programmatic access to its forwarding tables.

When the sample is imprinted in its paraelectric phase in conditions leading to complete confinement, in cavities of size lower than the natural lamellar length observed in a continuous thin film, the crystallographic a axis aligns preferentially parallel to the substrate, and the crystalline lamellae are of significantly reduced length.

40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} the mobile {{telecommunications}} industry has resulted in near-saturated markets and thus intense competition. Due to high new customer acquisition costs, mobile network operators (MNOs) provide attractive offers to competitors existing customers to encourage switching. Consequently, MNOs currently face <b>accelerated</b> <b>switching</b> rates, despite using contracts {{as a means of}} customer lock-in. Therefore preventing switching in this industry has become vital. The study develops and tests a conceptual switching intention model using switching intention data. Switching antecedents investigated are relational switching costs, perceived value and alternative attractiveness. Subsequently, actual switching behaviour data is compared to the conceptual switching intention model. Finally, the role of relationship characteristics in both switching contexts is investigated. Primary data was collected via an online self-administered survey using a cross-sectional online panel. A contract with a South African MNO was a prerequisite for survey participation. Parameter estimates were obtained using maximum likelihood (ML) in AMOS and bootstrapping was conducted to confirm the stability of the ML estimates. EQS was used to obtain robust ML indices. The switching intention model fit indices obtained were as follows: x^ 2 /df = 6. 004 (x^ 2 = 966. 61; df = 161; p < 0. 000); RMSEA = 0. 070 [0. 066; 0. 074]; NNFI = 0. 943; CFI = 0. 952. In the switching behaviour context, the three antecedents explained only 12 % of variance; whereas the same antecedents explained 52 % of variance for switching intention. The results suggest that factors other than the antecedents investigated drive switching behaviour. Relationship depth weakly influenced switching intention, while the influence of relationship length and breadth was negligible. None of the relationship characteristics influenced switching behaviour. The strongest predictor of switching intention was alternative attractiveness. The relationship strength of the dependent variable and antecedent variables was stronger in the switching intention context than in the switching behaviour context. Findings suggest that switching intention and switching behaviour are intrinsically different. Moreover, customers may perceive an increase in their monthly bill as a reason to switch. However other factors may influence customers when their actual switching decision is made. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. Marketing ManagementPhDUnrestricte...|$|R

To <b>accelerate</b> the <b>switching</b> from input ports to output in the router partitioning of ports and dynamic queueing are proposed.

The matching for the packet switching is performed between group pairs (A, a) and (B, b) in parallel at one time slot and (A, b) and (B, a) at the next time slot. Dynamic queueing is proposed at each input port to reduce the packet delay and packet loss probability by employing the popup decision rule and applying it to each delay critical packet. The partitioning of ports is illustrated to be highly effective in view of delay, required buffer size and throughput.

Interestingly, this treatment suppressed the increase in angiogenic neoplasias seen in HRG knockout mice. However, if GP 1 ba treatment was initiated at a later stage, after the onset of the angiogenic switch, no suppression of tumor growth was detected in HRG-deficient mice. Conclusions: Our data show that increased platelet activation mediates the <b>accelerated</b> angiogenic <b>switch</b> in HRG-deficien...|$|R
5000|$|A power-on/power-off switch is {{triggered}} if the trolleybus {{is drawing}} considerable {{power from the}} overhead wires, usually by accelerating, {{at the moment the}} poles pass over the contacts. (The contacts are lined up on the wires in this case.) If the trolleybus [...] "coasts" [...] through the switch, the switch will not activate. Some trolleybuses, such as those in Philadelphia and Vancouver, have a manual [...] "power-coast" [...] toggle switch that turns the power on or off. This allows a switch to be triggered in situations that would otherwise be impossible, such as activating a switch while braking or <b>accelerating</b> through a <b>switch</b> without activating it. One variation of the toggle <b>switch</b> will simulate <b>accelerating</b> by causing a larger power draw (through a resistance grid), but will not simulate coasting and prevent activation of the switch by cutting the power.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Snake venoms consist {{primarily}} of proteins and peptides showing {{a myriad of}} potent biological activities which have been shaped by both adaptive and neutral selective forces. Venom proteins are encoded by multigene families that have evolved {{through a process of}} gene duplication followed by accelerated evolution in the protein coding region. Results Here we report five gene structures of three-finger toxins from a viperid snake, Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii. These toxin genes are structured similarly to elapid and hydrophiid three-finger toxin genes, with two introns and three exons. Both introns and exons show distinct patterns of segmentation, and the insertion/deletion of segments may define their evolutionary history. The segments in introns, when present, are highly similar to their corresponding segments in other members of the gene family. In contrast, some segments in the exons show high similarity, while others are often distinctly different among corresponding regions of the isoforms. Conclusion Ordered, conserved exon structure strongly suggests that segments in corresponding regions in exons have been exchanged with distinctly different ones during the evolution of these genes. Such a "switching" of segments in exons may result in drastically altering the molecular surface topology and charge, and hence the molecular targets of these three-finger toxins. Thus the phenomenon of <b>accelerated</b> segment <b>switch</b> in exons to alter targeting (ASSET) may {{play an important role in}} the evolution of three-finger toxins, resulting in a family of toxins with a highly conserved structural fold but widely varying biological activities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ypt/Rab {{proteins}} {{constitute the}} largest subfamily of the Ras superfamily of monomeric GTPases and are regulators of vesicular protein transport. Their slow intrinsic GTPase activity (10 (- 4) - 10 (- 3) min(- 1) at 30 degrees C) {{has to be}} <b>accelerated</b> to <b>switch</b> the active to the inactive conformation. We have identified the catalytic domain within the C-terminal halves of two yeast GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Gyp 1 p and Gyp 7 p, with specificity for Ypt/Rab GTPases. The catalytically active fragments of Gyp 1 p and Gyp 7 p were more active than the full-length proteins and accelerated the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates of their preferred substrates by factors of 4. 5 x 10 (4) and 7. 8 x 10 (5), respectively. The K(m) values for the Gyp 1 p and Gyp 7 p active fragments (143 and 42 microM, respectively) indicate that the affinities of those GAPs for their substrates are very low. The catalytic domains of Gyp 1 p and Gyp 7 p contain five invariant arginine residues; substitutions of {{only one of them}} (R 343 in Gyp 1 p and R 458 in the analogous position of Gyp 7 p) rendered the GAPs almost completely inactive. We suggest that Ypt/Rab-GAPs, like Ras- and Rho-GAPs, follow the same mode of action and provide a catalytic arginine ('arginine finger') in trans to accelerate the GTP hydrolysis rate of the transport GTPases...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{randomized controlled}} clinical trial {{was to assess the}} impact of immediate incubation of blood cultures delivered to the laboratory outside its hours of operation on turnaround times, antibiotic prescription practices, and patient outcomes. A continuously monitoring blood culture incubator was placed outside the laboratory, which was switched on (intervention arm) and off (control arm) in a randomized manner. Included were new bacteremia episodes of patients older than 18 years. During the 30 -week study period, the first positive blood culture specimen of an episode had to be brought to the laboratory outside its hours of operation. The median time from specimen collection until growth detection was reduced by 10. 1 h in the intervention arm (P < 0. 001). For 46 of 66 (70 %) episodes in the intervention arm and for 51 of 85 (60 %) episodes in the control arm, the antibiotic regimen was changed (not significant). The median time until the first change in the antibiotic regimen was 42. 8 h in the intervention arm and 64. 0 h in the control arm (P, 0. 024). There was no difference in length of stay or hospital mortality. Immediate incubation of blood cultures outside laboratory hours reduces turnaround times and <b>accelerates</b> antibiotic <b>switching.</b> Appropriate antibiotic therapy for bacteremia is associated with a decrease in mortality (10).
