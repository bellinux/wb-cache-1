500|$|After John {{receives}} {{a call from}} Mortimer that Henry has run off with a gun, John, Sherlock and Lestrade run to the hollow to find Henry about to commit suicide.

Liberty, In" [...] on it; a child couldn't cope with this, so his mind tricked him.

As Henry calms down, they all see the innkeepers' dog; John shoots it. Sherlock finds and catches Frankland at the scene.

Sherlock surmises that John was poisoned by the leaking pipes in the laboratory, and John realises Sherlock locked him in the labs {{in order to test}} his theory.
