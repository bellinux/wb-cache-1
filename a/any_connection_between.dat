5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied <b>any</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E

In 2007, partly in {{response}} to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E

25|$|In 1731 the Swiss {{mathematician}} Gabriel Cramer {{published a}} dissertation, {{at the end}} of which appeared a sketch of a theory very similar to Fatio's - including net structure of matter, analogy to light, shading - but without mentioning Fatio's name. It was known to Fatio that Cramer had access to a copy of his main paper, so he accused Cramer of only repeating his theory without understanding it. It was also Cramer who informed Le Sage about Fatio's theory in 1749. In 1736 the German physician Franz Albert Redeker also published a similar theory. <b>Any</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> Redeker and Fatio is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{what some}} have speculated {{was an attempt}} at damage control {{just days after the}} interview, Barbour {{suspended}} the prison sentences of Jamie and Gladys Scott, two African American women who received life sentences resulting from a 1993 mugging in which the two women stole $11. Barbour has denied that there was <b>any</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the suspension of the Scott sisters' prison sentence and the controversy surrounding his Weekly Standard interview. Jamie Scott suffered from kidney failure while in prison, and requires a donated organ, which her sister Gladys had volunteered to provide. Barbour's decision to release the Scott sisters, however, is contingent upon the promised organ donation by Gladys Scott, which critics argued amounted to coercion and raises questions of medical ethics.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{agrees with}} all the other Scandinavian sources in telling the story of Halga's incestuous {{relationship}} with his daughter Yrsa, it disagrees with all of them and with Beowulf by removing Hrothgar altogether as the king of Denmark. Instead, his place is taken by his brother Halga, and Hrothgar is sent to Northumberland, where he marries Ögn, the daughter of a positively fictive king Norðri who is named after Northumberland (Norðimbraland). Opinion is divided on whether there is <b>any</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> Hrothgar's wife Wealhþeow in Beowulf and his wife Ögn in Hrólfr Kraki's saga; {{it has been suggested that}} Ögn shows that Wealhþeow and her family (the Helmings) were Anglo-Saxon.

25|$|His {{murder is}} {{currently}} unsolved, but initial suspicions led investigators to the high-profile organized crime cases he handled. According {{to a former}} Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief agent, two insider sources within Mexico's security agencies believe that El Chapo was behind Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. This line of investigation considers that El Chapo was dissatisfied with the way Bermúdez Zacarías managed the extradition process against him. They believe that after Bermúdez Zacarías suspended El Chapo's extradition to the U.S. in May 2016, El Chapo considered that Bermúdez Zacarías was putting him in danger by keeping him in a Mexican prison. Investigators alleged that El Chapo was pushing for his extradition because he feared for his life in Mexico because the government {{could not afford to}} have him escape from prison a third time. The former DEA chief agent stated that his sources told him that Bermúdez Zacarías received death threats a few days before he was killed. It remains unclear to investigators if there is <b>any</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the murder and the high-profile cases he presided. The perpetrators remain at large.|$|E
25|$|King Wulfhere's charter, and Bede's {{mention of}} Medeshamstede's foundation, place {{this in the}} period of the Christianisation of Mercia. Documents {{preserved}} at Peterborough Abbey indicate that Medeshamstede {{played a central role in}} spreading and consolidating Christianity in Mercia and elsewhere, for example through the pastoral care provided by a string of daughter churches. Apart from churches connected with the local saints mentioned above, these are held to have included, among other candidates, churches at Breedon in Leicestershire, and Bermondsey and Woking, in Surrey. Medeshamstede has also been identified as the mother church of Repton, in Derbyshire, which has been described as an 8th-century Mercian royal mausoleum. Another charter preserved at Peterborough was written at Repton in 848 AD, and concerned Breedon. This suggests that this monastic empire continued for some considerable time. However, this is the latest surviving reference to <b>any</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> Medeshamstede and its daughter churches, and these connections probably suffered a similar fate to many of the episcopal sees of eastern England: extinguished in the later 9th century by Viking invasion.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Bailey Deeming (30 July 1842 – 23 May 1892) {{murdered his}} first wife and four {{children}} in Rainhill near St. Helens, Lancashire, in 1891.

Moral insanity was for disorders that only seemed to arise from a person's feelings and habits, not their intellect. The other three types involved increasing degrees of intellectual abnormality: a partial derangement that was limited to certain trains of thought; a full mania, by which was meant 'raving madness' regardless of topic; and lastly, a breakdown of <b>any</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> ideas, referred to as incoherence or dementia.|$|R

In the early 20th century, many Italian stonemasons were working throughout Letcher County, building public buildings and churches, many of which still exist today. So, perhaps the post office name was intended to honor these craftsmen.|$|R
