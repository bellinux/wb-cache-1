Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution only {{requires}} {{members of}} the Council to be Singapore citizens residing in Singapore who are at least 35 years old. There is no restriction on Cabinet ministers and members of political parties. Moreover, the Prime Minister may authorize any Minister, Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to attend Council meetings. It has been noted that this may have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the Council's deliberations as such a guest might be the author or a vocal proponent of the legislation under scrutiny. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested}} that members with political affiliations can often make the biggest contribution towards the Council's discussions. Another criticism of the PCMR's composition is that having judges on the Council may lead to a conflict of interest as they may have to exercise judicial review over Acts of Parliament they have either endorsed or rejected previously.|$|E

2500|$|Anticipating {{a series}} of cases yet to come, Harlan {{addressed}} whether the materials had been rendered obscene by {{the way in which}} they were advertised. [...] Section 1461 said that advertising could render materials obscene, and Chief Justice Earl Warren (concurring in Roth) had agreed on constitutional grounds. [...] But Harlan, writing for the majority, concluded that the government had not argued that the advertising made the materials obscene. Section 1461, Harlan noted, did not require scienter (knowledge of wrongdoing), and to impose the requirement that publisher investigate every advertiser in their pages would impose <b>an</b> unconstitutional <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> free speech.|$|R
25|$|This {{resulted}} in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, {{especially those in the}} army, culminating in his assassination {{in the course of the}} February 26 Incident. This had <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World WarII.|$|E
25|$|In early March 2016, the Office of the Ombudsman {{ordered the}} {{dismissal}} of Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian and six other city and fire officials for grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty {{in connection with the}} factory fire. The ombudsman said that Gatchalian, Padayao, Carreon, and Avendan were liable for issuing business permits to Kentex Manufacturing Corp. in 2015 despite its delinquent status. On his part, Gatchalian has already secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) from the Court of Appeals against the dismissal order by the Ombudsman.

25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system {{is supposed to be}} able to read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E

That had <b>a</b> continuously <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the population who realised that, {{even though they were}} allowed certain social activities, they could not overstep the boundaries and delve into or discuss forbidden subjects. This realisation, including the absence of any civil rights as well as maltreatment during police arrest, ranging from threats to beatings or worse, made life under the junta a difficult proposition for many ordinary citizens. Photography by ordinary citizens was banned in public locations.|$|R

50|$|The APF {{referred}} to several key international law decisions, including {{reports of the}} UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Human Rights Council, which all found metadata retention regimes breached human rights, especially the right to privacy.

As a result, the LIV submitted that mandatory third party data retention regimes are neither necessary nor proportionate, irrespective of increased concerns regarding national security threats.|$|R
25|$|Gamergate {{supporters}} were {{critical of the}} wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose {{from a list of}} target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser. Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli {{claimed that}} leading climate {{scientist}} Michael E. Mann had possibly violated state fraud laws, and without providing {{any evidence of}} wrongdoing, filed the Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation as a civil demand that the University of Virginia provide {{a wide range of}} records broadly related to five research grants Mann had obtained as an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> future research. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation. Cuccinelli issued a revised subpoena, and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court which ruled in March 2012 that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was hailed as a victory for academic freedom.|$|E
25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the international economy because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{distinction}} between a legal system which utilizes judges as triers of both law and fact, {{as opposed to a}} system which incorporates jury trials, has been termed artificial. In a jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom, the same test applies to both jury and non-jury cases. Arguably in a non-jury legal system, there is more public interest in ensuring that judges remain accountable to the people. Hence, there should be greater freedom to discuss the manner in which judges carry out their functions. Finally, {{it has been said that}} the preference for the inherent tendency test because it allows the court to take action before the administration of justice is affected should be evaluated carefully, as it may have <b>an</b> undue <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> speech.|$|R
40|$|In 1998, {{consumer}} activist Marc Kasky sued Nike, {{claiming that}} Nike’s {{statements in the}} media denying sweatshop conditions in its factories were false advertising. This case, culminating in a controversial California Supreme Court decision, has attracted much criticism on its implications of free speech. Little {{attention has been paid}} to how Nike v. Kasky might be a useful tool for anti-sweatshop advocates, who have up until now had great difficulty holding companies accountable for their sweatshop labor conditions. This Note examines the anti-sweatshop movement and its lack of effective private enforcement techniques. It then explores how the California Supreme Court in Kasky expanded the commercial speech doctrine. Lastly, it analyzes how Kasky might be used by anti-sweatshop advocates against corporations with sweatshop conditions. This Note concludes that Kasky is an imperfect tool but one that, when used in moderation, would not have <b>a</b> strong <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> corporate speech...|$|R
60|$|A good night's rest! The {{words had}} hardly been spoken, {{the door had}} hardly been closed, before Arthur half-repented the hasty words that had just escaped him.

An older man would have thought nothing of those words, and would have acted, without reference to them, as his calmer sense suggested. But Arthur was too young to treat the ridicule, even of his inferiors, with contempt--too young not to fear the momentary humiliation of falsifying his own foolish boast, more than he feared the trial of watching out the long night in the same chamber with the dead.|$|R

These lesbian kiss episodes often occurred during times of the year when networks were most concerned about generating ratings, and have come to be viewed by some critics as gimmicks to help secure those ratings. The controversy generated by [...] "Sugar & Spice" [...] and other lesbian kiss episodes led to <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the non-sensationalized presentation of same-sex intimacy on network television through {{most of the rest of}} the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Banks first {{commanded}} a military district in eastern Maryland, which notably included Baltimore, {{a hotbed of}} secessionist sentiment and a vital rail link. [...] Banks {{for the most part}} stayed out of civil affairs, allowing political expression of secessionism to continue, while maintaining important rail connections between the north and Washington, DC. He did, however arrest the police chief and commissioners of the city of Baltimore, and replaced the police force with one that had more carefully vetted pro-Union sympathies. [...] In August 1861, Banks was assigned to the western district of Maryland. [...] There he was responsible for the arrest of legislators sympathetic to the Confederate cause (as was John Adams Dix, who succeeded Banks in the eastern district) in advance of legislative elections. [...] This, combined with the release of local soldiers in his army to vote, ensured that the Maryland legislature remained pro-Union. Banks's actions had <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Confederate sentiment in Maryland. [...] Although it was a slave state, it remained loyal through the war.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} the perceived effect of tobacco industry allegations of "illegal lobbying" by public health professionals on policy interventions for tobacco control. METHODS: Structured {{interviews were conducted}} with state health department project managers in all 17 National Cancer Institute-funded American Stop Smoking Intervention Study (ASSIST) states. Documentation and media records related to ASSIST from the National Cancer Institute, health advocates, and the tobacco industry were analyzed. RESULTS: The tobacco industry filed formal complaints of illegal lobbying activities against 4 ASSIST states. These complaints had <b>a</b> temporary <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> tobacco control policy interventions in those states. ASSIST states not targeted by the tobacco industry developed an increased awareness of the industry's tactics and worked to prepare for such allegations to minimize disruption of their activities. Some self-reported self-censorship in policy activity occurred in 11 of the 17 states (65 %). CONCLUSIONS: Public health professionals need to educate themselves and the public about the laws that regulate lobbying activities and develop their strategies, including their policy activities, accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{arbitration}} is {{an important}} tool in public sector bargaining, since public safety workers are prohibited from striking. There is concern, however, over the effects of interest arbitration on impasse rates, most notably theorized by the so-called “chilling” and “narcotic” effects. Overall, interest arbitration {{has been associated with}} an increase in impasse rates compared to situations where workers are allowed to go on strike, but the reasons and extent to which this is the case are debatable. Previous theoretical work suggests <b>a</b> strong <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> negotiations when interest arbitration is an option, but the empirical support for this theory is limited. As well, empirical support for a narcotic effect is weak, at least after {{the first three years of}} bargaining under interest arbitration. Although we are generally in a period retrenchment of bargaining rights, this issue remains an important one, particularly in states where the extension of interest arbitration to new groups (e. g. teachers) is being debated and in light of the interest arbitration provisions of recent Employee Free Choice Act...|$|R
40|$|China's {{control of}} {{information}} online is often imposed by social media platforms {{in the name}} of “rumor management. ” This article examines the content moderation strategies of Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging platform, in regulating discussion of rumors following the 2015 Tianjin blasts. More than 100, 000 Weibo posts were collected and categorized into three data sets: rumor discussion posts from the public, rumor-debunking posts from Weibo's official rumor rebuttal accounts, and posts removed from the system. Two content-moderation rumor strategies, namely rumor rebuttal and content removal, were identified. Clustering analysis and time series analysis was applied to test how these two strategies were used to filter posts of different topics and how they were associated with public discussion of rumor-related topics. Our findings suggest that the platform's response to rumor varied depending on the political sensitivity of the topic. Time-series analysis indicated that the implementation of both strategies was usually associated with a subsequent increase in general discussion about the rumor, suggesting that these strategies do not create <b>a</b> consistent <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> public speech...|$|R
500|$|In his 2008 National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong {{indicated}} that the purpose behind various government policies, including the creation of Speakers' Corner, was to [...] "liberalise our society, to widen the space for expression and participation". Its reception was mixed, however, {{and there have been}} a wide range of views and perspectives on the impact of Speakers' Corner in increasing the space for free speech and the freedom to assemble. It has been called an [...] "exercise in tokenism" [...] for the purpose of preserving a literal [...] "space" [...] for engaging in free speech while also [...] "cornering" [...] it in that space. This is reflected in the relative lack of progress towards liberalization in other areas such as awards of high damages in libel lawsuits brought by politicians which has been said to have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> political speech in Singapore. Former Workers' Party member James Gomez has also expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the Speakers' Corner as a site of vibrant political debate, citing the lack of a [...] "culture of speaking" [...] amongst Singaporeans. The ban on racially or religiously sensitive speech has been criticized as possibly curtailing free speech on genuine political matters and limiting the scope of constitutionally entrenched fundamental liberties.|$|E
500|$|Lord Brown concurred. [...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client’s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> experts' willingness to give evidence.

40|$|Under the Fair Housing Act and its 1988 amendments, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has {{the power}} to {{investigate}} alleged discrimination in public housing. The targets of these investigations are often neighborhood organizations and community groups voicing their opposition to the placement of public housing in their neighborhoods. The alleged discrimination can be nothing more than group meetings and the petitioning of local government officials. Mindful that such investigations have sometimes adversely affected the exercise of First Amendment rights, in 1994 HUD issued guidelines for handling fair housing complaints when such rights are at issue. This Note will first explain the goals of the Fair Housing Act and its 1988 amendments, and then will survey some of the representative investigations undertaken by HUD. This Note then will analyze the constitutionality and effectiveness of HUD 2 ̆ 7 s new guidelines.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that network effects should drive faster market growth {{due to the}} bandwagon effect. However, as we show, network externalities may also create an initial slowdown <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> growth because potential customers wait for early adopters, who provide them with more utility, before they adopt. In this study, we explore the financial implications of network externalities by taking the entire network process into account. Using an agent-based {{as well as an}} aggregate-level model, and separating network effects from word of mouth, we find that network externalities have <b>a</b> substantial <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the net present value associated with new products. This effect may occur not only in a competitive framework, such as a competing standards scenario, but also in the absence of competition. Drawing on the collective action literature in order to relate network effects to individual consumer threshold levels, we find that the <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> is stronger with a small variability in the threshold distribution, and is especially affected by the process early on in the product life cycle. We also find a “hockey stick” growth pattern by empirically examining the growth of fax machines, CB radios, CD players, DVD players, and cellular services...|$|R
