Other is necessary for solving global analytical questions, when rules are created over data matrices describing the same properties with different measures etc. Another important part of the thesis lies on providing a XML structure template for saving outputs of global analysis. It is also possible to use this XML structure for automatized generation of global <b>analytical</b> <b>reports.</b> Last part of the thesis is based on case study which shows how to use the guidelines and methods suggested in previous chapters.
