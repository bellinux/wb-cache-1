40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to examine the relationships between sensory <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> air quality made using different methods: odor intensity by category scale, category-ratio scale and equal-intensity matching with acetone as a reference and acceptability scale, and to study whether the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability {{can be explained by}} selected characteristics of the air. A sensory panel assessed the air polluted by emissions from different building materials at different area-specific ventilation rates. The three <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> odor intensity were linearly strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, for practical applications it seems feasible to apply only one of the investigated methods. Odor intensity was strongly correlated with the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability of the air. This suggests that, for the investigated materials, the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability are mainly influenced by odor intensity. The selected descriptors characterizing the air could not explain the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability because the odor intensity levels were generally low...|$|R

40|$|The {{personal}} <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> {{the current}} and expected future {{state of the environment}} by 3130 community respondents in 18 nations were investigated at the local, national, and global spatial levels. These assessments were compared to a ranking of each country’s environmental quality by an expert panel. Temporal pessimism (‘‘things will get worse’’) was found in the assessments at all three spatial levels. Spatial optimism bias (‘‘things are better here than there’’) was found in the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> current environmental conditions in 15 of 18 countries, but not in the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the future. All countries except one exhibited temporal pessimism, but significant differences between them were common. Evaluations of current environmental conditions also differed by country. Citizens’ <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> current conditions, and the degree of comparative optimism, were strongly correlated with the expert panel’s <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> national environmental quality. Aside from the value of understanding global trends in environmental assessments, the results have important implications for environmental policy and risk management strategies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} teacher {{perceptions and}} preferences for distance education {{provided by the}} Massachusetts Corporation for Educational Telecommunications (MCET). Teachers assessed the quality of satellite broadcasts that were used for either K– 12 classes or adult professional development. This ex post facto research used a sample of teachers who submitted program evaluation forms between 1994 and 1998 (n = 1, 131). Teachers indicated their preferences for either live or taped broadcasts, {{the age of the}} audience, and then assessed program quality using 16 Likert-scaled questions. ^ Three basic questions guided this study. First, did a relationship exist between audience age and preferences for either synchronous or asynchronous timing? Second, did teacher <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> distance education vary according to the age of the audience? Third, did teacher <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> distance education vary according to teacher preferences for either synchronous or asynchronous timing? ^ A chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between student age and preferences for distance education timing. Two-way analysis of variance showed that audience age and timing were significantly related to teacher <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> distance education. <b>Assessments</b> <b>of</b> K– 12 programming were more positive than <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> adult professional development. There was a definite preference for live broadcasts of both K– 12 and adult programming; but quality <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> live programming were less positive than <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> taped programming in almost every comparison. Responses to questions pertaining to student engagement and higher order thinking skills were ranked among the lowest mean scores. ^ It was concluded that teachers considered MCET distance education primarily as a source of subject-related content and not as a resource for promoting engagement, motivation, and critical thinking. Second, live-interactive programming was highly attractive to distance learners, but once experienced, <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> live programming were not as positive as <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> taped programming. Finally, this study concluded that adults preferred asynchronous learning strategies. Principal recommendations of this study included, (a) teachers should consider student age when arranging for either synchronous or asynchronous distance education activities, (b) teachers should make optimum use of supplemental materials that are designed to develop higher order thinking skills, and (c) further research should examine the possible relationship between the degree that teachers use supplemental materials and their <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> distance education programming. ...|$|R
