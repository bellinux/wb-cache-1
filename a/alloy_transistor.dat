50|$|The {{germanium}} alloy-junction transistor, or <b>alloy</b> <b>transistor,</b> was {{an early}} type of bipolar junction transistor, developed at General Electric and RCA in 1951 as an improvement over the earlier grown-junction transistor.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961 IBM started {{developing}} a low speed computer logic family that used selenium diodes with similar characteristics to silicon but {{cost less than}} one cent. The terminal development departments were begging for low cost and didn’t need speed. It was possible to punch eighth inch discs from a sheet of selenium diode. GE claimed they could make reliable selenium diodes. They could do better than the three to five year life of selenium rectifiers but TV manufacturers liked the shorter life. [...] A design was achieved for a DDTL circuit with two levels of diode logic feeding one <b>alloy</b> <b>transistor</b> and no series input resistor or speed up capacitor. The family was called SMALL for Selenium Matrix ALloy Logic. The <b>alloy</b> <b>transistor</b> proved to be too fast for the selenium diode recovery. To solve this problem a selenium diode was connected around the base-emitter to slow it down. The two level logic {{was similar to the}} PLAs Programmable logic array that would come on the market many years later. Nearly any static logic function that yielded one output could be achieved with one transistor and a handful of cheap diodes. Several years later the selenium diodes indeed were not reliable and were replaced by silicon diodes. The logic family was packaged on SMS cards.|$|E
50|$|The first planar {{transistors}} {{had much}} worse characteristics than <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistors</b> of the period, {{but as they}} could be mass-produced and <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistors</b> could not, they cost much less and the characteristics of planar transistors improved very rapidly, quickly exceeding those of all earlier transistors and making earlier transistors obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Micro-alloy {{transistor}} (MAT) {{high speed}} type of <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor.</b> Developed at Philco.|$|R
50|$|General Electric {{pioneered the}} <b>alloy</b> {{junction}} <b>transistor</b> process for germanium transistors. Bell Labs, {{the inventor of}} the transistor, also had a similar process (called the rate-grown junction process), but many manufacturers preferred GE's process because it fit better for mass production and resulted in higher yields. The 2N43-45 series was GE's first commercial <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor</b> using the 2N numbering system.|$|R
25|$|Tetrode {{transistor}} {{high speed}} variant of grown-junction <b>transistor</b> or <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor</b> with two connections to base.|$|R
25|$|Micro-alloy {{diffused}} transistor (MADT) high speed type of <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor,</b> speedier than MAT, a diffused-base transistor. Developed at Philco.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} types of tetrode {{transistor}} developed in the early 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later grown junction <b>transistor</b> and <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor.</b> Both offered much higher speed than earlier transistors.|$|R
50|$|Modified grown {{junction}} <b>transistor</b> or <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor</b> having two connections {{at opposite ends}} of the base. It achieved its high speed by reducing the input to output capacitance. It became obsolete in the early 1960s with the development of the diffusion transistor.|$|R
50|$|The {{spacistor}} was {{a type of}} transistor {{developed in}} the 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor.</b> It offered much higher speed than earlier transistors. It became obsolete in the early 1960s {{with the development of}} the diffusion transistor.|$|R
40|$|The lumped-model {{characterization}} for junction transistors {{has been}} extended to current ranges where the transistor operation {{may no longer be}} considered linear. A number of effects are considered which contribute to the nonlinear behavior. In all cases it is shown that the self-bias cutoff effect plays an important part in the deterioration of performance at high currents. In <b>alloy</b> <b>transistors,</b> both normally and inversely biased, an exact solution for the form of the current gain as a function of collector current is given for the case where the injected density is small compared with the equilibrium base majority-carrier density. This solution is shown to be applicable to normally biased diffused-base units. A decrease in current gain is predicted due to the self-bias effect. The sources of lateral base current are bulk recombination and injection into the emitter, the relative amount being immaterial since both are proportional to the injected density. In the small-area alloy devices, it is seen that the injected density becomes large compared with the base majority-carrier density before the transistor performance is appreciably degraded. In such cases the lateral base current is seen to be normally dominated by non-unity emitter efficiency. In all cases, surface recombination is assumed to be the dominant source of total base current, and the first-order correction to the linear theory is shown to exhibit a 1 /(1 + Ki_c) dependence. At higher currents all cases follow the observed 1 /i_c proportionality. The effect of nonlinear phenomena on saturation voltage is considered in some detail. The saturation voltage is shown to increase with drive current, again emphasizing the importance of avoiding large overdrive currents. The use of <b>alloy</b> <b>transistors</b> as low-level signal switches is discussed, indicating the necessity for high values of β and low values of K...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{transistorized}} {{radios and}} other equipment needed a suitable voltage miniature battery. Early transistor radios required a [...] volt battery. Although the transistors would theoretically operate from lower voltages, in 1954, the point contact transistors had to be operated very close to their VCB0 limit {{in order to get}} the required frequency response. Fortunately a suitable miniature battery was already marketed for (vacuum tube) hearing aids. As transistors rapidly improved, particularly when <b>alloy</b> <b>transistors</b> were introduced, radios were able operate from lower voltages and the battery manufacturers introduced suitable batteries as the demand arose. The PP3 (physically identical to 6LR61 or 1604A) appeared when portable transistorised radio receivers became common, and is still called a [...] "transistor" [...] battery by some manufacturers. The Eveready company claims that it introduced this battery type in 1956.|$|R
50|$|Antimony is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} semiconductors as a dopant in n-type silicon wafers for diodes, infrared detectors, and Hall-effect devices. In the 1950s, the emitters and collectors of n-p-n <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistors</b> were doped with tiny beads of a lead-antimony alloy. Indium antimonide {{is used as a}} material for mid-infrared detectors.|$|R
50|$|He is {{particularly}} known {{for developing the}} first mass-production <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor</b> and used the fallouts or transistors that did not meet specifications as transistors to be sold {{at a much lower}} cost, the CK721 and CK722. Raytheon quickly moved into <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor</b> because of the lower noise, more rugged and lend it self to mass production, compared to point contact transistor. Establishing a tradition that would become a distinctive feature of early transistors, these (CK722) were production drop-outs from another transistor line, the CK721, that did not pass test criteria for the CK718 hearing aid transistor (the main product). However they could be sold at a much lower cost as a lower specification product. This concept help start a new market for transistors, the experimenter and hobby line. Seeing this window of opportunity Krim linked up with Radio Shack to market the hobby grade transistors. Other manufacturers followed soon after.|$|R
50|$|Like Raytheon's CK722, the GE 2N107 were fallouts or rejects of GE's {{successful}} 2N43, 2N44 and 2N45 <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistors.</b> Unlike early Raytheon transistors, {{which were}} sealed in a resin material, GE devices were housed in metal hermetically-sealed enclosures, removing oxygen and other potential contaminants to ensure reliability and long life, {{since many of}} the 2N43-45 transistors were used in military applications. Unlike most transistors sold in the 1950s that cost $10 or more, the 2N107's initial price was under $2.00; still {{a lot of money for}} the experimenter in the 1950s, but within reach.|$|R
5000|$|Germanium bipolar {{transistors}} with substantial power handling capabilities (100 mA collector current) were introduced around 1952; with {{essentially the same}} construction as signal devices, but better heat sinking. Power handling capability evolved rapidly, and by 1954 germanium <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistors</b> with 100 watt dissipation were available. These were all relatively low-frequency devices, used up to around 100 kHZ, and up to 85 degrees Celsius junction temperature. [...] Silicon power transistors were not made until 1957, but when available had better frequency response than germanium devices, and could operate up to 150 C junction temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{developments}} {{included the}} grown-junction transistor (1951), the surface-barrier transistor (1953), the diffusion transistor, the tetrode transistor, and the pentode transistor. The diffused silicon 'mesa transistor' was developed at Bell in 1955 and made commercially available by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958. The spacistor [...] was {{a type of}} transistor developed in the 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later <b>alloy</b> junction <b>transistor.</b> [...] In 1953, Philco had developed the world's first high frequency surface-barrier transistor, which {{was also the first}} transistor that was suitable for high speed computers. The world's first all-transistor car radio, manufactured by Philco in 1955, used surface-barrier transistors in its circuitry design.|$|R
5000|$|The 2N107 is {{an early}} {{germanium}} <b>alloy</b> junction PNP <b>transistor</b> developed by General Electric (GE) in 1955, to become GE's entry into the electronic hobbyist market successfully started with the CK722 transistor. Like the CK722, it enjoyed a long-standing popularity. General Electric decided to designate it with a JEDEC 2N- series identification. [...] This is unusual for a hobby device. Soon after, other manufacturers got involved in the hobby business like Sylvania, Tung-Sol and RCA.|$|R
500|$|North American Philips Corporation built a [...] {{plant at}} 100 Providence Pike, North Smithfield, Rhode Island (Slatersville) on a [...] plot in 1959. The 15-acre {{property}} is {{recorded by the}} Town of North Smithfield Tax Assessor as Lot No. 60 on Plat No. 4, and Lot No. 385 on Plat No. 5. There are five buildings located on the property. The property is bordered to the north by Industrial Drive; to the south by Comstock Road, to the east by a grassy area; and to the west by Providence Pike. The plant was operated by one of Philips' fully owned subsidiaries, Amperex Electronics, to supply IBM, one of Philips' largest customers, with high speed, gold-doped germanium logic diodes. Millions of these diodes were manufactured at the Slatersville plant every year. With the advent of silicon diodes in 1962 there was a decreasing demand for these germanium diodes, so Philips transferred their germanium Post <b>Alloy</b> Diffused <b>Transistor</b> (PADT) manufacturing to Slatersville {{to take advantage of}} the site's capacity.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of device design and processing techniques for the fabrication of an augmented power transistor capable of fast switching and high voltage power conversion is discussed. The major device goals sustaining voltages {{in the range}} of 800 to 1000 V at 80 A and 50 A, respectively, at a gain of 14. The transistor switching rise and fall times were both to have been less than 0. 5 microseconds. The {{development of}} a passivating glass technique to shield the device high voltage junction from moisture and ionic contaminants is discussed as well as the development of an isolated package that separates the thermal and electrical interfaces. A new method was found to <b>alloy</b> the <b>transistors</b> to the molybdenum disc at a relatively low temperature. The measured electrical performance compares well with the predicted optimum design specified in the original proposed design.

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) layered {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently {{emerged as a}} new class of atomically thin semiconductors for diverse electronic, optoelectronic, and valleytronic applications. To explore the full potential of these 2 D semiconductors requires a precise control of their band gap and electronic properties, which represents a significant challenge in 2 D material systems. Here we demonstrate a systematic control of the electronic properties of 2 D-TMDs by creating mixed alloys of the intrinsically p-type WSe 2 and intrinsically n-type WS 2 with variable alloy compositions. We show that a series of WS 2 xSe 2 - 2 x alloy nanosheets can be synthesized with fully tunable chemical compositions and optical properties. Electrical transport studies using back-gated field effect transistors demonstrate that charge carrier types and threshold voltages of the <b>alloy</b> nanosheet <b>transistors</b> can be systematically tuned by adjusting the alloy composition. A highly p-type behavior is observed in selenium-rich alloy, which gradually shifts to lightly p-type, and then switches to lightly n-type characteristics with the increasing sulfur atomic ratio, and eventually evolves into highly n-doped semiconductors in sulfur-rich alloys. The synthesis of WS 2 xSe 2 - 2 x nanosheets with tunable optical and electronic properties represents a critical step toward rational design of 2 D electronics with tailored spectral responses and device characteristics. © 2015 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|An abrupt p-n junction, such as {{occurs at}} the {{collector}} junction of an n-p-n transistor, is considered. The ratio of n- to p-region conductivity is taken to be very high, so that the transition region is restricted almost entirely to the p-region. The electron density distribution n within the transition region is investigated {{as a function of}} the applied reverse bias V_c, and of the minority carrier electron current density J which is injected into the transition region from the neutral p- region. It is shown that significant departures occur from the conventional solutions in which the presence of current is neglected. In particular, the electron density n_c at the plane of injection and the transition region thickness w_t, used as collector boundary conditions in the analysis of transistor operation, are shown to be current-dependent. Two cases are considered. In Case I, applicable to transistors with an epitaxial layer under the collector, the electron velocity is assumed much less than the limiting drift velocity. For low injection level, where the minority carrier density n is everywhere less than the equilibrium majority carrier density p_p, the transition region is a essentially a depletion region and the injected electrons move in an electric field determined uniquely by the applied voltage. It is shown that n_ ∝ J and w_t ∝ V_c^(l/ 2). For high injection level, hen n >> p_p, the transition region is essentially an accumulation region, and conditions of space-charge-limited current flow are established for which n_c ∝ J^(2 / 3) and w_t ∝ V_c^(2 / 3 /(J^(l-/ 3)). In Case II, applicable to most <b>alloy</b> and diffused-base <b>transistors,</b> the electron velocity is assumed equal to the limiting drift velocity throughout the transition region. Mobile carrier depletion at low injection again gives way to accumulation at high injection. The functional relationships remain as for Case I at low injection, but become n_c ∝ J, w_t ∝ V_c^(l/ 2 /J^(1 / 2)) at high injection. Semi - quantitative and detailed quantitative treatments are developed, and normalized graphs of the minority carrier density as a function of distance within the transition region are given for various junction voltages and injected currents...|$|R
