25|$|Because surface ocean {{currents}} {{are driven by}} the movement of wind over the water's surface, the Coriolis force also affects the movement of {{ocean currents}} and cyclones as well. Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called gyres. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the <b>air,</b> the <b>deflection</b> caused by the Coriolis effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the Coriolis effect, the faster the wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing {{the strength of the}} hurricane.|$|R

5000|$|Chilled beam {{systems are}} not a panacea. Additional {{ductwork}} {{may be needed to}} meet minimum outdoor air requirements. Both types of chilled beam systems are less effective at heating than cooling, and supplementary heating systems are often needed. Chilled beam systems cannot be used alone in buildings where the ceilings are higher than 2.7 m, because the air will not properly circulate. A forced-air circulation system must be employed in such cases. If the water temperature is too low or humidity is high, condensation on the beam can occur—leading to a problem known as [...] "internal rain." [...] (In some cases, drier outside air can be mixed with the wetter inside air to reduced interior humidity levels while maintaining system performance.) Chilled beam {{systems are not}} recommended for areas with high humidity (such as theaters, gymnasiums, or cafeterias). Because they are less effective at cooling, passive chilled beam systems are generally ill-suited for semi-tropical and tropical climates. Hospitals generally cannot use chilled beam systems because of restrictions on using recirculated air. Chilled beam systems are also known to cause noticeable air circulation which can make some people uncomfortable. (Passive <b>air</b> <b>deflection</b> devices can help disrupt these air patterns, alleviating the problem.) Some designers have found that enlarging the ducts around active chilled beam systems to increase air circulation causes echoes in working areas and amplifies the sound of water moving through the pipes to noticeable levels.|$|E

The overall geometry of the de-vice allows simple fluidic delivery to each cantilever to immobilize molecules for biological and chemical detection.

We describe the fabrication process and show results related to the dynamic characterization of the device as a differential sensor. The root-mean-squared (rms) sensor noise in water and air is 1 nm over the frequency range of 0. 4 – 40 Hz.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the likeliness of an attack from {{explosives}} has increased dramatically. Hence, the {{need to find a}} reliable device with the ability to detect explosives has increased even more. Sensing schemes based on micro-cantilever beams and their bending responses to specific explosives are considered to be an effective technique for explosives detection. In this study the bending responses of an array of micro-cantilever beams integrated with micro-heaters are recorded when they are exposed to various combustible materials. The results show that the micro-cantilever beams display a distinct response when exposed to different combustible materials. In the experiments it was observed that typically the deflection of the micro-cantilever beam in response to the thermal bi-metallic actuation was greater when exposed to acetone vapors than that for alcohol and <b>air.</b> Also, the <b>deflection</b> of the beam was greater for experiments using iso-propyl alcohol than that for air.

40|$|In a {{ventilated}} space, {{the incoming}} air jet {{and the resulting}} airflow pattern play key roles in the removal or supply of heat, moisture, and harmful gases from or to living organisms (man, animal and plant). In this research, an image processing method was developed to visualize and quantify the two-dimensional trajectory and the deflection angle of an air jet in a ventilated room. The two-dimensional trajectory equation of an air jet describes {{the position of the}} air jet {{as a function of the}} distance from the <b>air</b> inlet. The <b>deflection</b> angle of an air jet from the initial path at the air inlet is used to distinguish easily between a falling, unstable or horizontal air jet and to quantify the air jet in one number.

50|$|Comparative {{hardness}} {{and density}} determine {{the results of}} collisions with bullets. Bullets tend to penetrate low density materials like <b>air</b> with little <b>deflection,</b> although friction causes rotated projectiles to drift {{in the direction of}} rifling twist as the bullet falls through the atmosphere under the influence of gravity. Ricochets may be similarly deflected in the direction of rotation of the side of a spin-stabilized bullet contacting a resistant surface. Dense objects tend to prevail in collisions with less dense objects; so dense bullets tend to penetrate less dense materials, and dense materials tend to deflect light bullets. Resistance to penetration can be evaluated as the sectional density of the target material along the axis of bullet movement in front of the bullet. Metallic foil will be more easily penetrated than metal ingots, and sectional density of sheet metal increases as orientation of the sheet diverges from perpendicular to, toward parallel with, the bullet path. Bullets are more likely to ricochet off flat, hard surfaces such as concrete or steel, but a ricochet can occur from irregular surfaces within heterogeneous materials including soil and vegetation. Uniformly soft, flexible materials like sand have a lower incidence of ricochet. Though it may not be intuitive, bullets easily ricochet off water; compare stone skipping.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a high-performance micromachined lamellar-grating-interferometer-based Fourier transform spectrometer are presented. The device {{is designed to}} give high deflections with very low dynamic deformation and good mode separation. Mechanical self-stoppers are introduced to withstand accelerations larger than 500 g due to shock. The clear aperture area of the grating is about 10 mm 2. The maximum deflection while electrostatically actuated at ambient conditions is ± 356 µm at 71. 2 V and 340 Hz, setting a record for comparable devices. At a pressure of 8. 6 Pa, the same deflection is reached at 4. 3 V. Six hundred eighty spectra per second can be recorded with a resolution of 14 cm− 1. With a HeNe laser at 633 nm, a spectral resolution of 0. 54 nm (22 cm− 1) is reached using electrostatic actuation. The microelectromechanical systems device is integrated into a compact Fourier transform spectrometer setup including a blackbody source, an infrared (IR) detector, and a visible laser using the device back side for reference. Early results with IR interferograms are also reported. In addition, the devices are actuated with pressure waves in the ambient <b>air</b> to reach <b>deflections</b> up to± 700 µm.

As electronic devices are becoming more compact each day, the more effective and efficient active cooling technologies are needed. Microfluidic devices, such as synthetic jets, serve as a potential candidate to fulfill the thermal management needs of the next generation electronics. An experimental and computational study has been performed for circular central-orifice synthetic jets. First, a series of experiments was performed to quantify the actuator <b>deflection,</b> <b>air</b> velocity, heat transfer augmentation, and power consumption for central-orifice synthetic jets. Later, a computational study was performed utilizing the same boundary conditions in order to predict the deflection of the diaphragm. The experiments were conducted on three different types of synthetic jets, namely, low-, medium-, and high-frequency synthetic jets. Although a number of correlations were proposed for the prediction of Nu number for slot synthetic jets, no correlation was found to predict the average Nu number for a synthetic jet with a round orifice. Therefore, two correlations were developed, one for low- and medium-frequency synthetic jets and the other for high-frequency synthetic jets to predict the heat transfer coefficient {{as a function of the}} geometry, position, and operating condition for impinging flows. The proposed correlations are able to predict the impingement heat transfer of a synthetic jet with an accuracy of ± 25 % for a wide range of operating conditions and geometrical variables. Normalized frequency had the minimum impact on the average Nu number of a high-frequency synthetic jet compared with dimensionless distance, both have moderate impact on low- and medium-frequency jets.
