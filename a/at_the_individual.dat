5|$|Large cathedrals such as Elgin {{had many}} chapel altars with daily {{services}} {{that needed to}} be suitably staffed with canons assisted by a plentiful number of chaplains and vicars. Bishop Andreas allowed for the canons to be aided by seventeen vicars made up of seven priests, five deacons and five sub-deacons—later the number of vicars was increased to twenty-five. In 1350 the vicars at Elgin could not live on their stipends and Bishop John of Pilmuir provided them with the income from two churches and the patronage of another from Thomas Randolph, second Earl of Moray. By 1489 one vicar had a stipend of 12 marks; six others, 10 marks; one, eight marks; three, seven marks, and six received five marks; each vicar was employed directly by a canon who was required to provide four months' notice in the event of his employment being terminated. The vicars were of two kinds: the vicars-choral who worked chiefly in the choir taking the main services and the chantry chaplains who performed services <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> foundation altars though there was some overlapping of duties. Although the chapter followed the constitution of Lincoln, the form of divine service copied that of Salisbury Cathedral. It is recorded that Elgin's vicars-choral were subject to disciplinary correction for shortcomings in the performance of the services, resulting in fines. More serious offences could end in corporal punishment, which was administered in the chapterhouse by the sub-dean and witnessed by the chapter. King Alexander II founded a chaplaincy for the soul of King Duncan I who died in battle with Macbeth near Elgin. The chapel most frequently referenced in records was St Thomas the Martyr, located in the north transept and supported by five chaplains. Other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the Holy Rood, St Catherine, St Duthac, St Lawrence, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary the Virgin and St Michael. By the time of Bishop Bur's episcopate (1362–1397), the cathedral had 15canons (excluding dignitaries), 22vicars-choral and about the same number of chaplains.|$|E

Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons.

Hamilton became a professional cyclist in 1995 with the US Postal Service cycling team. He was a teammate of Lance Armstrong during the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Tours de France, where Armstrong won the Yellow jersey. He was a key asset for Armstrong, being a very good climber as well as time-trialist. Hamilton appeared at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2004, he {{won a gold medal}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> time trial. The first doping test after his Olympic victory gave a positive result, but because the backup sample was frozen, no doping offence could be proven. After he failed further doping tests at the 2004 Vuelta a España, Hamilton was suspended for two years from the sport.|$|E
25|$|Seed predation, often {{referred}} to as granivory, is a type of plant-animal interaction in which granivores (seed predators) feed on the seeds of plants as a main or exclusive food source, in many cases leaving the seeds damaged and not viable. Granivores are found across many families of vertebrates (especially mammals and birds) as well as invertebrates (mainly insects); thus, seed predation occurs in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. Seed predation is commonly divided into two distinctive temporal categories, pre-dispersal and post-dispersal predation, which may involve different strategies and requirements and have different implications <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and population level. Nevertheless, regardless of timing, seed predation has great implications for plant population dynamics. To counterbalance effects of predation, plants have evolved defenses such as seed morphology (size, shape, toughness) and chemical defenses (secondary compounds such as tannins and alkaloids) to defend against their seed predators. However, as plants have adapted defenses to seed predation (e.g., chemical compounds), so have seed predators adapted to plant defenses (e.g., ability to detoxify chemical compounds). Thus, many interesting examples of coevolution arise from this dynamic relationship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} the Collective Neuro Evolution (CONE) method, and compares its efficacy for designing specialization, with a conventional Neuro-Evolution (NE) method. Specialization was defined <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> agent, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> agent group level. The CONE method was tested comparatively with the conventional NE method in {{an extension of}} the multirover task domain, where specialization exhibited <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and group level is known to benefit task performance. In the multi-rover domain, the task was for many agents (rovers) to maximize the detection and evaluation of points of interest in a simulated environment, and to communicate gathered information to a base station. The goal of the rover group was to maximize a global evaluation function that measured performance (fitness) of the group. Results indicate that the CONE method was appropriate for facilitating specialization <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and agent group levels, where as, the conventional NE method succeeded only in facilitating individual specialization. As a consequence of emergent specialization derived <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and group levels, rover groups evolved by the CONE method were able to achieve a significantly higher task performance, comparative to groups evolved by the conventional NE method.
