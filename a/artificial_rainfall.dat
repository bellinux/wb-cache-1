In this study, instrumented model embankments were subjected to <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfalls</b> to investigate the effects of the slope inclination on their stability. The results of the study suggested that when the slope inclination is greater than the friction angle of the soil, the failure is initiated by the loss of soil suction and when it is smaller than the friction angle of the soil, the failure is initiated by the positive pore water pressure developed at the toe of the slope.

The model is a so-called distributed rainfall-runoff model, which accounts for spatial variations within the watershed; {{it is based on}} a distributed version of the time-area method (Clark, 1945). Travel times are calculated by assuming that the flow can be modelled as creeping flow, and the resulting velocity field is used to solve the so-called time-of-flight/Eikonal equation. Both topographical and heterogeneous properties can be accounted for by the model, which ideally can be used for both gauged and ungauged watersheds after calibration.

40|$|More {{recently}} we {{meet with}} many extremes of weather. One such are sudden and heavy rainstorms. Now most these rains endanger the agricultural land {{the emergence of}} water erosion. Most sensitive to water erosion are wide row crops, including sugar beet also. For these reasons, in recent years we paid great attention {{to the impact of}} tillage effects on soil water erosion. 	The aim of this thesis was evaluate the influence of autumn tillage on water erosion soil in the stand of sugar beet, but also on the yield and quality parameters of the crop. A secondary aim was to assess the effect of increasing the leafy ground cover beet on water erosion soil. 	For this purpose over the years 2012 - 2015 based on accurate field trials on lands Agro Chomutice Inc. Experiments were set up in three variants namely shallow loosening (10 cm) deep plowing (25 cm) deep loosening (25 cm). In various growth phases proceeds <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall.</b> In the first growth phase was not sugarbeet involved either in row and not in the between rows. In the second growth phase of the beet involved in the row between rows but not yet. In the third growth phase has been fully involved growth. Itself <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall</b> was performed field simulator rain and was observed soil loss from individual variants. At <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall</b> it was found that sugar beet is the most threatened by water erosion soil in the early growth phase and at this phase the most evident difference autumn tillage to sugar beets. In the first growth phase of sugar beet, which was carried <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall,</b> the best results both for deep loosening and deep plowing. In 2012 (24. 5. 2012) was measured with a deep loosening of soil loss of 1. 30 t ha- 1, representing a decrease of 64. 76 % compared to the shallow loosening and by 40. 91 % compared to deep plowing. Conversely, in 2014 (2. 6. 2014) was evaluated as the best variant of deep plowing the soil loss of 0. 11 t ha- 1. Such loss soil is 78. 43 % less compared to the deep loosening and lower by 91. 41 % compared to the shallow loosening. Similar results were achieved for both deep loosening and deep plowing in the later phases of growth, which was carried <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall.</b> From the results {{it was found that the}} sugar beet at later growth phases better resists water erosion. This is illustrated in 2012, when the first <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall</b> (24. 5. 2012) was observed soil loss of 2. 20 t ha- 1 for deep plowing. In the second <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfall</b> (6. 6. 2012) 0. 03 t ha- 1, and the third (1. 8. 2012) have been measured zero loss soil. The same results were achieved in the following experimental years. On deep loosening achieved the largest root yield (99. 71 t ha- 1), but the difference between deep plowing (99. 32 t ha- 1) was only 0. 39 %. The highest sugar content reached variant with deep loosening (18. 95 %). When the statistical treatment has not been established between the variants statistically significant difference. The greatest yield root recalculated at 16 % sugar content reached variant with deep loosening (122. 32 t ha- 1), but again the difference between deep plowing (119. 81 t ha- 1) was only 2. 10 %. Results from four years has clearly demonstrated beneficial effect of deep loosening and deep tillage on soil water erosion in the sugar beet crop. Furthermore, it was found that with increasing abundances leaf and root growth of sugar beet decreases danger of water erosion. Sugar beet is the most susceptible to water erosion in the early phases of growth, and at this time was applied deep autumn tillage. For a fully wired vegetation were not detected significant loss soil, and at this time ceases to be a dangerous erosion sugar beet crop. For yield and quality parameters of sugar beet was found positive effect of deep loosening and deep tillage on yield and quality of sugar beet.

Soil irregularities, such as aggregates, clods and interrill depressions, influence water infiltration and overland flow. The objective {{of this study is to}} observe and quantify clod evolution under cumulated precipitation. We prepared two soil trays with loose silt soil and pre-sieved clods put on top, at low and high concentrations. These trays were then subjected to a set of five successive <b>artificial</b> <b>rainfalls.</b> The digital elevation models (DEM) were recorded for each tray, at millimetric resolution, at the initial stage and after each subsequent rainfall. The clods were automatically segmented on the DEM and the diameter, surface area and volume of these clods were measured by computer. The isolated clods showed comparable behavior on both trays. The small clods were almost always decreasing in volume until they disappeared. The other clods swelled during the first rain or the first two rains, and then decreased in area and volume. The decrease was faster for volume than for area. This probably reflected a soil detachment phenomenon, which mostly affected the heights of the clods. On the high concentration tray, the close inter-proximity of the clods induced merging and the formation of blocks. The rate of decrease of clod volume as a function of cumulative precipitation could be modeled using exponential and linear equations. Small and intermediate-sized clods showed an exponential decrease that was smoother as the clod size increased. Large clod volume decrease was almost linear. We were further able to model the trend of the slope parameter of the exponential decrease, as a function of clod size. Our study has shown how the DEM recording and image analysis can be used to quantify the evolution of clods under rainfall, improve our understanding of clod dynamics under rainfall and roughness parameterization. The size dependency of clod volume decrease is important for soil conservation decisions.

In order to induce the drought, a 20 x 20 ?m throughfall exclusion setup was established. Throughfall was excluded from 1 April to 3 July 2009. During this period, 270 ?mm of rainfall occurred (27 % of annual precipitation), of which more than 90 % was excluded. Sapflow, stem growth, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured in both drought and reference plots. Prior to the induced drought, both plots showed similar soil water content, transpiration rates and tree diameters. The primary control on forest water loss was vapour pressure deficit, whereas soil moisture had an effect when it reached below 0. 068 ?m 3 ?m- 3 during the growing season. The rainfall exclusion did not negatively affect Ec until early June, approximately 54 ?days after drought initiation. Ec was 27 % less in the drought plot compared to the reference plot when evaluated {{at the end of}} the growing season in November. Tree growth estimates {{at the end of the}} growing season indicated a 17 % decrease in growth in the drought plot as compared to the reference plot.

Further, moisture content/pore-water pressure measurements near the toe of the slope and the real-time factor of safety can also be used for prediction of rainfall-induced embankment failures with adequate accuracy. ...|$|E
30|$|In this research, {{long-term}} climatology, hydrometric, {{water resources}} and consumption data were analyzed. The results {{were used to}} drawn various GIS maps in Dehgolan alluvial plain and charging and draining values of the aquifer were taken into investigation. Water balance equation outcomes showed − 15.029 MCM/year as groundwater misplaced in Dehgolan alluvial plain aquifer which caused groundwater level depletion. According to the large subside of the plain, it appears that Dehgolan plain has achieved unreturnable situation. It must be paid attention that in this plain there are many illegal wells which extract groundwater with no restriction. It is necessary to forbid extra water extraction from agricultural wells using new consumption management methods to prevent more depletion in groundwater. Prohibiting digging new wells, obstructing illegal wells, stopping boring bedrocks in existing wells, managing water consumption and concerning concept of virtual water are some solutions for prohibiting water resources lost in the study area. Recharging the aquifer using <b>artificial</b> injection of <b>rainfall</b> into soil layers and aquifer in wet seasons is another solution. Currently, water resources managers in Iran, to supply surface water to offset declining groundwater, are trying to use interbasin water transfer which is faced many challenges and criticizes. It is clear that if this consumption trend continues, even mentioned plans could not control this excessive depletion. Similarly, charging aquifers by rivers is not a worthy solution because it could change the quality of groundwater, which could make an intensive environmental crisis in long periods of time.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} on soil erosion by different bedrock bareness ratios, different rainfall intensities, different underground pore fissure degrees and rainfall duration are researched through manual simulation of microrelief characteristics of karst bare slopes and underground karst crack construction {{in combination with}} <b>artificial</b> simulation of <b>rainfall</b> experiment. The results show that firstly, when the rainfall intensity is small (30 and 50 mm h − 1), no bottom load loss is produced on the surface, and surface runoff, underground runoff and sediment production are increased with the increasing of rainfall intensity. Secondly, surface runoff and sediment production reduced with increased underground pore fissure degree, while underground runoff and sediment production increased. Thirdly, raindrops hit the surface, forming a crust with rainfall duration. The formation of crusts increases surface runoff erosion and reduces soil infiltration rate. This formation also increases surface-runoff-erosion-damaged crust and increased soil seepage rate. Raindrops continued to hit the surface, leading the formation of crust. Soil permeability showed volatility which was from reduction to increases, reduction, and so on. Surface and subsurface runoff were volatile with rainfall duration. Fourthly, when rock bareness ratio is 50 % and rainfall intensities are 30 and 50 mm h − 1, runoff is not produced on the surface, and the slope runoff and sediment production present a fluctuating change with increased rock bareness ratio. Fifthly, the correlation degree between the slope runoff and sediment production and all factors are as follows: rainfall intensity-rainfall duration-underground pore fissure degree–bedrock bareness ratio...|$|R
3000|$|... (i) The {{increasing}} temperature on {{the valley}} floor over the last 40  years has increased evaporation, mainly from the four lakes (Ziway, Langano, Abiyata, and Shala) that occupy roughly 11 % of the total area of the Central Rift Valley (Ayenew 2003), {{to the extent that}} the increased evaporation could significantly alter the water cycle and lead to an increase in rainfall. The five stations that recorded increasing rainfalls (Langano, Bulbula, Ziway, Adami Tulu, and Meki) are also close to the lakes (within 7  km, Fig. 1). Existing studies indicated that Mesoscale (1 – 30  km radius) and local scale (300  m to 2  km radius) climate is influenced by proximity and size of water surfaces (Aguilar et al. 2003). For example, Nieuwolt (1977) reported that Lakes Abaya and Chamo on {{the valley floor}} farther south in the rift valley produce large amounts of water vapour and also create local disturbances that are conducive to the production of rain. Similarly, Haile et al. (2009) reported the development of high and thick clouds over Lake Tana in north-western Ethiopia and frequent rains heavier than 10  mm/h at stations relatively close to the lake. Lauwaet et al. (2012) found differences in rainfall patterns with distance from Lake Chad, but large-scale atmospheric processes were not affected. There is also further evidence elsewhere that showed the construction of small <b>artificial</b> lakes augmented <b>rainfall</b> in semi-arid Mexico (Jauregui 1991). Generally, large inland lakes together with highly variable topography and vegetation can cause significant spatial variability in the rainfall pattern in eastern Africa (Nicholson 1998).|$|R
