5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost twice <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> a large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate {{a higher level of}} intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Asteroids in the {{asteroid}} belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> their partners.

For comparison, the equatorial radius of the planet Jupiter is 71,492 km, which is 65% <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> Wolf 359's.|$|E

5|$|Back on June 6, when a {{civilian}} miner {{was killed by}} raiders {{near the village of}} Blue Mounds in the Michigan Territory, residents began to fear that the Rock River Ho-Chunks were joining the war.

Two militiamen were killed in the attack, one of whom was badly mutilated.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> $1 million.|$|E
5|$|Boletus caucasicus, {{found in}} {{southern}} Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, {{in contrast to}} the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S.luridus. Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which have been reported to be <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed Boletus barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
