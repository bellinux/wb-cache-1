40|$|This {{report is}} volume 2 of a two-volume {{ecological}} assessment of grassland ecosystems in the Southwestern United States. Broad-scale assessments are syntheses of current scientific knowledge, including {{a description of}} uncertainties and assumptions, to provide a characterization and comprehensive description of ecological, social, and economic components within an assessment area. Volume 1 of this assessment focused on the ecology, types, conditions, and management practices of Southwestern grasslands. Volume 2 (this volume) describes wildlife and fish species, their habitat requirements, and species-specific management concerns, in Southwestern grasslands. This assessment is regional in scale and pertains primarily to lands administered by the Southwestern Region of the USDA Forest Service (Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, and western Oklahoma). A primary purpose of volume 1 is to provide information to employees of the National Forest System for managing grassland ecosystems and landscapes, both at the Forest Plan level for Plan <b>amendments</b> <b>and</b> <b>revisions,</b> <b>and</b> at the project level to place site-specific activities within the larger framework.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a seaward delimitation of United States {{jurisdiction over the}} mineral resources of its continental shelf. It does not set lateral maritime boundaries between the United States and its neighbors. Despite the abundance of literature regarding the continental shelf concept, United States shelf limits have not been demarcated in any precise detail. In order to encourage efficient utilization of offshore mineral resources and to avoid unnecessary legal problems, such determination is important. Initially, the conflicting conceptions of the geological and legal continental shelf are discussed. The evolution of the continental shelf as both a physical feature of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s crust and a legal political doctrine is traced through the first three chapters. The fourth chapter examines the current definition of the continental shelf in detail, suggesting <b>amendments</b> <b>and</b> <b>revisions</b> where found necessary...|$|R

Using this method it was up for the individual to count the amount of tax they are to pay and to hand the tax in to tax offices. The second method is the non-individual tax counting (menghitung pajak orang lain) method.

40|$|It {{belongs to}} the {{conventional}} wisdom that national parliaments have increasingly lost in overall importance due to the evolution of the EU’s political system. By passing subsequent Treaty <b>amendments</b> <b>and</b> <b>revisions</b> they accepted shifts of competencies to the European level,which reduced their final say over major areas of traditional legislative powers and the political control over governments. The European Convention on the future of Europe induced a debate between the different levels of EU parliamentarism about the optimal loci and phases of parliamentary involvement in EU affairs. The major puzzle of this paper is, why and under which circumstances political actors promoted different forms of parliamentary participation in EU policy making. Furthermore, it discusses how national parliaments (re) -act and adapt to a dynamic institutional and procedural set-up, and in what manner parliamentary actors in different national and socio-political settings ‘acclimatise’ to common challenges, constraints and opportunities. Given the growing salience of the EU system and its daily output, participation and involvement are vital issues for the overall weight and role of parliaments. It is of major importance for the legitimacy of the constitutional set-ups of the EU member states and of the Union itself. Whatever institutional arrangements will be taken it will tell us something about the future shape of the European polity in the broader sense.

40|$|The key {{contribution}} to the legislation of heritage preservation in Taiwan primarily derived from the historical monument movements in the 1970 s. Specific legislation results include the establishment of Council for Cultural Affairs and {{the implementation of the}} Cultural Heritage Preservation Act in 1982. Although the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act is the first subjective cultural act, its lack of structure during the initial commencement stages made it un-conducive to heritage preservation and thus unable to meet the people’s expectations. Therefore, throughout the 33 years after the implementation of the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act, the Act has been amended 6 times. These amendments reflect the degree of importance that the society has attached to heritage preservation, and the innovative system also showcases the progress in preservation concepts and methods. These innovative orientations, such as emphasizing on the authenticity and integrity of heritage preservation, intangible cultural heritage, and cultural diversity, conform to the international preservation trends. They are also local trends such as encouraging community participation, adaptive-reuse, or enhancing the local governments’ powers to implement local cultural governance. This is particularly true for the fifth comprehensive revision in 2005, which has symbolic significance because its contents epitomized the heritage preservation work while moving Taiwan’s heritage preservation system towards globalization and localization. Therefore, we analyzed the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act <b>amendment</b> <b>and</b> <b>revision</b> processes over the past 33 years to highlight the innovations in Taiwan’s cultural heritage work and illustrate their globalization and localization features. Finally, we proposed recommendations for Taiwan’s preservation work in the future as the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act is about to undergo its seventh amendment in 2015...|$|R
