5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire. Interstate rivalries, violent insurrections (such as the Whiskey Rebellion), and solidifying opposition to the national government {{in the form of the}} Anti-Federalist Party combined with its dependence on trade with Europe to weaken the new nation. During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was held together <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression {{back to the surface}} pressure. Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> hyperbaric oxygen treatment.|$|E

Volunteers for the SBS are {{now taken}} from all {{branches}} of the British Armed Forces, although volunteers still predominantly come from the Royal Marines Commandos. Candidates wishing to serve with the Special Boat Service must have completed {{at least two years}} regular service and will only be accepted into the SBS after completion of the selection process.|$|E

5|$|Technetium-99 decays <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> beta decay, {{emitting}} beta particles with consistent low {{energies and}} no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It {{can also be}} extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.|$|E
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Highway61 in the south, {{the route}} {{proceeds}} straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road {{to the west}} and Hanna Road to the east. Surrounded <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> farmland, the highway encounters McCluskey Drive onekilometre (0.62mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive twokilometres north of that. At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the right of way at the intersection. The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the right of way at the intersection.|$|E

5|$|In July 1886 an Australian {{prospector}} {{reported to}} the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which {{within a few years}} was the largest city in southern Africa, populated <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven children. Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E
5|$|The double album The Wall {{was written}} <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> Waters and is {{largely based on}} his life story, and having sold over 23million RIAA {{certified}} units in the US as of 2013, {{is one of the}} top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA. Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album, and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the album's sleeve art. The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of The Wall was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} household was staffed <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>by</b> eunuchs {{and ladies}} {{with their own}} bureaus. Female servants were organized into the Bureau of Palace Attendance, Bureau of Ceremonies, Bureau of Apparel, Bureau of Foodstuffs, Bureau of the Bedchamber, Bureau of Handicrafts, and Office of Staff Surveillance. Starting in the 1420s, eunuchs began taking over these ladies' positions until only the Bureau of Apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained. Hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the Directorate of Palace Attendants, but as eunuch power at court increased, so did their administrative offices, with eventual twelve directorates, four offices, and eight bureaus. The dynasty had a vast imperial household, staffed with thousands of eunuchs, who were headed by the Directorate of Palace Attendants. The eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance, ceremonial rites, food, utensils, documents, stables, seals, apparel, and so on. The offices {{were in charge of}} providing fuel, music, paper, and baths. The bureaus were in charge of weapons, silverwork, laundering, headgear, bronzework, textile manufacture, wineries, and gardens. At times, the most influential eunuch in the Directorate of Ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state.|$|E
