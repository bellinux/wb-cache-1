Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} describing {{the content and}} time allocated to undergraduate medical education curricula in child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry <b>and</b> make recommendations about child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry teaching goals and curricula content. METHOD: A literature search from 1970 to February 2007 using the key words undergraduate, curriculum, teaching, education, psychiatry, child, <b>adolescent,</b> <b>and</b> medical school, was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. RESULTS: There is limited agreement about curricula content for undergraduate child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry teaching programs in medical schools, {{with a wide range}} of objectives identified by different programs. On average, the time allowed for teaching child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry is small. There is also great variation in the time allocated by different medical schools. In many countries, the number of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists with academic appointments is limited, <b>and</b> child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry programs are developed and taught by a small number of teaching staff at each medical school. CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools should reconsider the relatively low priority given to teaching child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry to medical students. The child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry profession must identify clear learning goals for a longitudinal developmentally appropriate model of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry education commencing at an undergraduate level in medical schools and continuing through residency and fellowships. There is a need to promote national and international standards for teaching in this area and to encourage stronger collaborations between teaching staff across different medical schools.

40|$|Objective: The {{national}} {{shortage of}} child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has prompted {{efforts to improve}} recruitment. It is uncertain whether these efforts will be sufficient to address this shortage {{and its impact on}} youth mental health services. Method: Data were compared from 1990 to 2001 by state, county characteristics, number of youths, and percentage of youths living in poverty to determine any changes in the number and distribution of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists. Trends in the number of residents and age distribution of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists were also analyzed. Results: The number of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has increased, but it still falls below estimates projected to adequately serve youth mental health needs. Disparities in child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrist distribution persist, with significantly fewer in rural counties or counties with a high percentage of children living in poverty. The age of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has shifted, with fewer below age 35. The number of residents in training has not changed significantly since 1995. Conclusions: The shortage of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists remains <b>and</b> is still accentuated for those living in rural areas or in poverty. Despite the increased number of child <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists, the number of residents and changes in workforce age indicate that the shortage will continue. J. Am. Acad.

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
