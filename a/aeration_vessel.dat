40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of a thiosulfate-oxidizing bioreactor that allowed high elemental sulfur production and recovery efficiency. The reactor system, {{referred to as a}} Supernatant-Recycling Settler Bioreactor (SRSB), consisted of a cylindrical upflow reactor and a separate <b>aeration</b> <b>vessel.</b> The reactor was equipped with an internal settler and packing material (structured corrugated PVC sheets) to facilitate both cell retention and the settling of the formed elemental sulfur. The supernatant from the reactor was continuously recirculated through the aerator. An inlet thiosulfate concentration of 100 mmol l − 1 was used. The reactor system was fed with 89 mmol l − 1 d − 1 thiosulfate reaching 98 to 100 % thiosulfate conversion with an elemental sulfur yield of 77 %. Ninety-three percent of the produced sulfur was harvested {{from the bottom of the}} reactor as sulfur sludge. The dry sulfur sludge contained 87 % elemental sulfur. The inclusion of an internal settler and packing material in the reactor system resulted in an effective retention of sulfur and biomass inside the bioreactor, preventing the oxidation of thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfate in the aerator and, therefore, improving the efficiency of elemental sulfur formation and recovery.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study indicated that}} the oxidative assimilation capacity of a heterogeneous microbial population for acetic acid {{did not return to}} the initial value after a period of endogenous respiration in the presence of ammonium sulfate. In view of this finding {{it was not possible to}} recommend fully the use of a continuous oxidative assimilation process for the treatment of nitrogen-deficient waste waters of noncarbohydrate nature. To put the process to a severe test, a laboratory-scale pilot plant study was done. Acetate (1, 000 mg/liter) was fed continuously to a completely mixed, aerated reactor vessel, from which the mixed liquor was channeled to a settling basin. The settling basin supernatant fluid was continuously discharged, and a portion of the settled biological sludge was subjected to endogenous respiration in the presence of ammonium sulfate and was recycled to the <b>aeration</b> <b>vessel.</b> Experiments were conducted at three levels of ammonia nitrogen in the endogenous phase. Approximately 90 % removal of the carbon source (expressed as chemical oxygen demand, COD) was attained with a low level of supplemental nitrogen (COD/N = 70 : 1) and a fairly low reactor detention time (4 hr). Based upon these and previous results, it has been concluded that the process shows promise for application to the treatment of a wide variety of nitrogen-deficient industrial wastes...|$|E
40|$|The Callide Oxyfuel Project (COP) is the world's largest {{operating}} oxy-fuel {{plant and}} has successfully demonstrated the retrofitting capability for oxy-fuel to capture CO₂. The compression {{of the raw}} flue gas at the COP has also demonstrated that NO x and Hg can also be removed {{as part of the}} liquid condensate. This work presents field tests conducted on the condensates to determine the stability of captured NO x and Hg species when depressurised. These tests involved sampling liquid condensate directly into a customised <b>aeration</b> <b>vessel</b> and measuring the evolved gases over an 8 – 12 h period. The low-pressure condensate (∼ 4 bar) showed that 3 – 18 % of captured NO x species and 0. 5 – 1. 2 % of the Hg were volatile, while the high-pressure condensate (24 bar) re-emitted 2 – 68 % of captured NO x and 0. 05 – 12. 5 % of the captured Hg. These tests showed that volatile Hg was related to volatile NO x and that this volatility of condensates changed with time as the compression plant operated from start-up. Equilibrium calculations of HNO₂ in the gas and liquid phases supported the volatility measurements, suggesting that the rate of oxidation of HNO₂ to HNO₃ in the condensed phase is slow. Overall, the conditions which favoured NO x stability in the condensates, namely longer residence and higher pressure also favoured Hg stability. This work has shown that emissions from an oxy-fuel compression plant must include those emanating from depressurised condensates and suggest that the re-emitted species may not the same as in typical combustion flue gas, but the result of higher-pressure conversion...|$|E
40|$|Aeration (To supply or charge with air) is a unit-operation to {{be widely}} used in {{disposition}} of city sewerage and aerobic biological disposition of organic plant wastewater. There are three forms in aeration，they are surface mixer aeration and air bubbles aeration and turbine mixer aeration. We perceived the flow in the <b>aeration</b> <b>vessels</b> with suface mixer and measured circulation time about various type's vessels and we got distributions of circulation time. And we used photographic method for determination circulation time. For this，we set inspecting section，which was illustrated in this paper，then catched the change of {{the brightness of the}} tracer between the bright section and the dark section. And we took a photograph of streamline of each section by the section photograph method...|$|R
40|$|In a stirred vessel {{with the}} aspect ratio of 2. 4, the gas-liquid mass {{transfer}} characteristics of triple-impeller configurations with surface aeration have been studied. The way by adding {{one or more}} impellers below the aerating impeller could not overcome the problem of poor gas dispersion in the region close {{to the bottom of}} the gas-liquid vessel stirred only by a surface aerator. With the combination of surface aeration and sparger aeration, gas dispersion is greatly improved. Triple-inipeller configurations and volumetric gas flow rates are optimized based on the volumetric mass transfer coefficient per power consumption. It is found that the sparging gas has only a little effect on the surface <b>aeration,</b> because the <b>vessel</b> is stirred by the triple-impeller configuration and with a larger aspect ratio...|$|R
40|$|Growth characteristics, oxygen exchange, and {{carbohydrate}} and chlorophyll contents {{were determined}} 30 days after subculturing of single node-derived plantlets of Solanum tuberosum cv Haig cultivated in vitro. Cultivation conditions were: (a) photomixotrophy in closed vessel, (b) photomixotrophy in closed vessel on medium supplemented with silver thiosulfate, (c) photomixotrophy in aerated vessel, (d) photoautotrophy in air, (e) photoautotrophy in CO 2 -enriched air. In photomixotrophic conditions, <b>aeration</b> of the <b>vessel</b> enhanced sucrose utilization {{and had a}} positive effect on plantlet growth. In photoautotrophic conditions, growth of the plantlets was slow in air and was strongly enhanced by CO 2 enrichment of the atmosphere. Starch to sucrose ratios were higher in plants grown photoautotrophically than in plants grown with sucrose in the medium. Oxygen exchange characteristics on a chlorophyll basis were similar between the plantlets when measured under moderate light, and resembled those of greenhouse plant leaves. In high light, however, plantlets grown photoautotrophically in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere had higher oxygen exchange rates. We concluded from these results that potato plantlets in vitro in conditions (c), (d), and (e) developed C 3 -plant photosynthetic characteristics, which were in photoautotrophically grown plantlets comparable to those of field-grown plants...|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with the OECD Guideline 303 A [41], a simulation test for aerobic sewage treatment was performed. A lab-scale sewage treatment plant (behrotest® Laborkläranlage KLD 4 N, behr Labor Technik GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) with a denitrification, nitrification and secondary clarifier was used. The {{validity of the test}} was reached when 80 % of the introduced DOC concentration (100 mg/L) had been eliminated by the microorganisms. Six systems were running as a control, four systems with continuous addition (influent) of AgNP at 0.04, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/L, and another with silver nitrate at 0.4 mg/L. The room temperature was kept at 20 °C to 25 °C. The oxygen level was controlled to range from 2 to 3.5 mg/L in the <b>aeration</b> <b>vessel</b> over the whole test period. The STP was set to run with a retention time of 6 h and a continuous flow of 750 mL/h containing a mixture of synthetic sewage, tap water and Ag stock dispersion mixed within a tube system (synthetic sewage was mixed with water and then with the AgNP resulting in a dilution of 1 : 10). The AgNPs were applied into the denitrification section. Synthetic sewage and AgNP stock dispersion were prepared as a tenfold concentration, as mentioned in the guideline, and stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator. The pH of the sewage sludge in the non-aerated and aerated vessels was consistently measured. Continuous reflux from the nitrification section into the denitrification section of 1.75 L/h was performed to avoid a decrease of pH. At test start, the sewage sludge was introduced into the STP and tap water was added to end up with a dry matter content of 2.5 g/L. For 3 days, the sewage sludge was adapted to laboratory conditions by continuously feeding it with just synthetic sewage before the addition of the AgNP for 10 days started. The dry matter content of sludge was determined periodically. The concentration of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia was checked photometrically in the effluent with test kits (Nanocolor, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and the flow rate was checked and adjusted if necessary. The DOC was measured daily in the influent flow and effluent.|$|E
40|$|Bioreduction {{is a novel}} {{method for}} the on-farm storage of fallen stock in a vessel {{containing}} water that is heated and aerated, prior to disposal. The combination of a mesophilic temperature and high bacterial population leads to rapid degradation of carcasses due to microbial and enzymatic breakdown of protein material; and ultimately the reduction in volume of waste to be disposed. The system could, however, be improved if more was known about the changes that occur during a bioreduction cycle. Pig carcasses were placed within two commercial-scale bioreduction vessels (BVs) (6. 5 m 3 capacity) and the changes in physicochemical parameters, enzymatic activity, gas emissions and microbial communities were analysed over 56 days. Analyses showed that each vessel displayed different physicochemical parameters. The microbial communities within both vessels were also distinct, though they converged between days 28 and 42 before again diverging. Of the enzymes assayed, acetylesterases showed the highest activity during initial stages, with a subsequent increase in lipase towards the end. All other enzymes showed little activity in comparison. Despite active <b>aeration</b> of the <b>vessels,</b> conditions were redox-constrained, leading to the emission of gases associated with anaerobic conditions, namely NH 3 and H 2 S. It was concluded that no single parameter governed the biochemical processes and that each BV will have its own unique microbial population and hence rate of decomposition. Further work is needed to increase the rate of bioreduction through bioaugmentation or developing enzyme additives...|$|R
