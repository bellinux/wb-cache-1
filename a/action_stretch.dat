5000|$|Stanislavski further {{elaborated}} {{his system}} with a more physically grounded rehearsal process {{that came to be}} known as the [...] "Method of Physical Action". The term itself was only applied to this rehearsal process after Stanislavski's death. Benedetti indicates that though Stanislavski had developed it since 1916, he first explored it practically in the early 1930s. The roots of the Method of Physical <b>Action</b> <b>stretch</b> back to Stanislavski's earliest work as a director (in which he focused consistently on a play's action) and the techniques he explored with Vsevolod Meyerhold and later with the First Studio of the MAT before the First World War (such as the experiments with improvisation and the practice of anatomising scripts in terms of bits and tasks). Benedetti emphasises the continuity of the Method of Physical Action with Stanislavski's earlier approaches; Whyman argues that [...] "there is no justification in Stanislavsky's sic writings for the assertion that the method of physical actions represents a rejection of his previous work". Stanislavski first explored the approach practically in his rehearsals for Three Sisters and Carmen in 1934 and Molière in 1935.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Clinically, it {{is assumed}} that {{spasticity}} of the calf muscles interferes with walking after stroke. The aim was to examine this assumption by evaluating the contribution of spasticity in the gastrocnemius muscle to walking dysfunction in an ambulant stroke population several months after stroke.  METHODS—Fourteen stroke patients who were able to walk independently and 15 neurologically normal control subjects were recruited. Both resting and <b>action</b> <b>stretch</b> reflexes of the gastrocnemius muscle were investigated under conditions that simulated walking. Resting tonic stretch reflexes were measured to assess spasticity whereas action tonic stretch reflexes were measured to assess the possible contribution of spasticity to gait dysfunction.  RESULTS—Two thirds of the stroke patients exhibited resting tonic stretch reflexes which indicate spasticity, whereas none of the control subjects did. However, the stroke patients exhibited action tonic stretch reflexes that were of similar magnitude to the control subjects, suggesting that their reflex activity during walking was not different from that of control subjects. Furthermore, {{there was no evidence that}} the <b>action</b> <b>stretch</b> reflex in the stroke patients contributed a higher resistance to stretch than the control subjects.  CONCLUSIONS—Whereas most of the stroke patients exhibited spasticity when measured both clinically and physiologically, they did not exhibit an increase in resistance to dorsiflexion due to exaggerated action tonic stretch reflexes. It is concluded that it is unlikely that spasticity causes problems in walking after stroke in ambulant patients. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to routinely reduce or inhibit the reflex response to improve functional movement in stroke rehabilitation. Factors other than spasticity should be considered when analysing walking after stroke, so that appropriate treatment is provided to patients. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of a village in rural {{southwest}} China. It explores the meaning and interrelations of three major concepts; work, relatedness and modernity, {{in order to understand}} everyday life in the village. Broadly, it ponders the questions what is work, what does it produce and to what extent does what you do and where you do it determine who you are. The study pays close attention to context and 'resonance'. The analysis is firmly rooted in the material environment and 'praxis' as well as consideration of verbal discourse. In short, it is argued that work, defined as all significant daily activities of villagers, creates relatedness in the village and outside it, and also defines villagers' place {{in the context of the}} wider modern world. In the village, rippling circles of <b>action</b> <b>stretch</b> from individual houses and outwards to fields and mountains. This flow of people through these circles is punctuated with greetings to friends and neighbours, exchange of news and gossip, favours and gifts. Relationships are produced through activity in these circles - working in them and moving through them. The complementarities of the work of men and women are emphasised but there is nevertheless a distinguishable division of labour by gender and generation. In the larger Chinese context, what it is like to be an 'uncivilised' and 'backward' peasant is discussed with its inherent distinction between 'a salaried job' and 'manual labour'; a salaried job being part of a modernity which young people and their parents on their behalf often aspire to and manual labour being what villagers do to earn their livelihoods...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reports of}} high {{frequency}} sound production by cusk-eels cannot be explained adequately by known mechanisms, i. e., a forced response driven by fast sonic muscles on the swimbladder. Time {{to complete a}} contraction-relaxation cycle places a ceiling on frequency and is unlikely to explain sounds with dominant frequencies above 1 kHz. We investigated sonic morphology in the fawn cusk-eel Lepophidium profundorum to determine morphology potentially associated with high frequency sound production and quantified development and sexual dimorphism of sonic structures. Unlike other sonic systems in fishes in which muscle relaxation is caused by internal pressure or swimbladder elasticity, this system utilizes antagonistic pairs of muscles: ventral and intermediate muscles pull the winglike process and swimbladder forward and pivot the neural arch (neural rocker) above the first vertebra backward. This <b>action</b> <b>stretches</b> a fenestra in the swimbladder wall and imparts strain energy to epineural ribs, tendons and ligaments connected to the anterior swimbladder. Relatively short antagonistic dorsal and dorsomedial muscles pull on the neural rocker, releasing strain energy, and use a lever advantage to restore the winglike process and swimbladder to their resting position. Sonic components grow isometrically and are typically larger in males although the tiny intermediate muscles are larger in females. Although external morphology is relatively conservative in ophidiids, sonic morphology is extremely variable within the family. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Future radio {{observations}} {{with the}} SKA and its precursors will {{be sensitive to}} trace spiral galaxies and their magnetic field configurations up to redshift z≈ 3. We suggest an evolutionary model for the magnetic configuration in star-forming disk galaxies and simulate the magnetic field distribution, the total and polarized synchrotron emission, and the Faraday rotation measures for disk galaxies at z 3. Since details of dynamo action in young galaxies are quite uncertain, we model the dynamo action heuristically relying only on well-established ideas of the form and evolution of magnetic fields produced by the mean-field dynamo in a thin disk. We assume a small-scale seed field which is then amplified by the small-scale turbulent dynamo up to energy equipartition with kinetic energy of turbulence. The large-scale galactic dynamo starts from seed fields of 100 pc and an averaged regular field strength of 0. 02 μG, which then evolves to a "spotty" magnetic field configuration in about 0. 8 Gyr with scales of about one kpc and an averaged regular field strength of 0. 6 μG.

50|$|The {{island is}} made up from sand and shingle and boulder clay eroded from the Holderness {{coastline}} washed down the coastline from Flamborough Head. Material is washed down the coast by longshore drift and accumulates to form the long, narrow embankment in the sheltered waters inside {{the mouth of the}} Humber estuary. It is maintained by plants, especially Marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). Waves carry material along the peninsula to the tip, continually extending it; as this <b>action</b> <b>stretches</b> the peninsula it also narrows it {{to the extent that the}} sea can cut across it in severe weather. When the sea cuts across it permanently, everything beyond the breach is swept away, only to eventually reform as a new spit pointing further south. This cycle of destruction and reconstruction occurs approximately every 250 years. More recently, Dr. John Pethick of Hull University put forward a different theory to explain the formation of Spurn Head. He suggests that the spit head has been a permanent feature since the end of the last ice age, having developed on an underwater glacial moraine. As the ice sheets melted, sea level gradually rose and longshore drift caused a spit to form between this and other islands along the moraine. Under normal circumstances, the sea washes over the neck of the spit taking sand from the seaward side and redepositing it on the landward side. Over time, the whole spit, length intact, slips back - with the spit-head remaining on its glacial foundation. This process has now been affected by the protection of the spit put in place during the Victorian era. This protection halted the wash-over process and resulted in the spit being even more exposed due to the rest of the coast moving back 110 yd since the 'protection' was constructed. The now crumbling defences will not be replaced and the spit will continue to move westwards at a rate of 2 m per year, keeping pace with the coastal erosion further north.|$|R

The proposed normalization methods are compared along with the orthogonal polynomials based iris recognition and analyzed to enhance the normalization stage. The impacts of proposed variable-size normalization versus rectangular normalization on extracted features are presented. From the empirical outcomes, it is examined that the variable-size normalization scheme performs better than the fixed-size normalization approach in terms of matching.
