5|$|The Jabala Upanishad is {{an ancient}} text, {{composed}} before 300 CE. It is among the oldest Upanishads that discuss the subject of renouncing the worldly life for the exclusive pursuit of spiritual knowledge. The text discusses the city of Banaras in spiritual terms, as Avimuktam. It describes how that city became holy, then <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> holiest place to revere is one within – the Atman (soul, self).|$|E
5|$|The actual musical {{ingredients}} of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua – concertato {{had been used}} by Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the Sonata sopra had been anticipated by Archangelo Crotti in his Sancta Maria published in 1608. It is, writes Denis Arnold, Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vespers achieved fame and popularity only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi's time.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also {{alluded to}} in the epic Mahabharata. In Book XIII, Upamanyu praises Shiva rhetorically asking if there is anyone else whose half-body is shared by his spouse, and <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} had risen from the union of sexes, as represented by Shiva's half-female form. In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man. In Book XIII, Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of his body {{is made up of}} her body.|$|E

5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time {{none of this was}} apparent to either side. Sokolov <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> decision to not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E

Zimmer <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Devil's Advocate was abolished by Pope John Paul II in 1983, 17 years before the novel was published.|$|E
25|$|Olivier Blanchard {{suggests}} that a fiscal union in the EZ can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the EZ peripheral countries. But he <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|E

25|$|Most likely, the menorah was looted by the Vandals in the sacking of Rome in 455 CE, {{and taken}} to their capital, Carthage.
