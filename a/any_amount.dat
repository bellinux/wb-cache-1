5|$|The three-cent silver {{was made}} fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and {{currency}} of the United States good to <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> for payment {{of public and}} private debt. By then, that coin had long since disappeared from circulation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> of hard liquor.|$|E

5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
50|$|Equity is the {{monetary}} {{value of a}} property or business beyond <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> owed on it in mortgages, claims, liens, etc. Repositioning means to place or put something in a new position; to position again.|$|R

5000|$|The one {{thousand}} colones note is called [...] "un rojo" [...] (one red) {{because of its}} colour. This also applies for <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> that are multiples of a thousand colones (e.g. twenty thousand colones = veinte rojos).|$|R
5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the Senate Banking Committee. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E
25|$|Combinations {{of up to}} 100 {{circulating}} Swiss coins (not including {{special or}} commemorative coins) are legal tender; banknotes are legal tender for <b>any</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Earthquake Commission covers only {{domestic}} residences {{with private}} insurance {{and does not}} provide cover for businesses. The EQC payout {{is limited to the}} first $100,000 plus GST of any individual claim, with <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> above that covered by the insurance company holding the policy. The insurance companies themselves had limited or no exposure, having offloaded most of their risk to reinsurance companies. The EQC has reinsurance of $2.5 billion with a $1.5 billion excess, so its exposure is the first $1.5 billion and <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> after the first $4 billion. It had a total fund prior to this earthquake of approx $6 billion.|$|E
50|$|Section 101 {{would require}} deposit in the Treasury of <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> of a Member's {{representational}} allowance remaining after all payments are made, {{to be used}} for federal deficit reduction, or, if there is no deficit, federal debt reduction.|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{experience}} of similar commemorative projects, CBO expects that <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> collected by the federal government would not be received for several years and would be offset by a transfer to the National Park Foundation (a nonfederal entity) soon thereafter.|$|R
50|$|In most jurisdictions, {{a lender}} may foreclose on the mortgaged {{property}} if certain conditionsprincipally, non-payment {{of the mortgage}} loanapply.

They live near each other in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is about an hour's drive from the Dolphins' stadium. They are the first African-American women to hold <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> of ownership in an NFL franchise.|$|E
25|$|A flood is an {{overflow}} of <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> {{of water}} that reaches land. Floods occur usually when the volume of water within a body of water, such as a river or lake, exceeds the total capacity of the formation, {{and as a result}} some of the water flows or sits outside of the normal perimeter of the body. However, floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes, if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.|$|E
25|$|However, {{only one}} of these Nash equilibria {{satisfies}} a more restrictive equilibrium concept, subgame perfection. Suppose that the first demands a large amount that gives the second some (small) amount of money. By rejecting the demand, the second is choosing nothing rather than something. So, {{it would be better for}} the second to choose to accept any demand that gives him/her <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> whatsoever. If the first knows this, he/she will give the second the smallest (non-zero) amount possible.|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{relations}} among properties of systems that consist of <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> of constitu- ents (including one particle), that have volume {{as the only}} parameter, and that are in thermodynamic equilibrium or stable equilibrium states. For large amounts of constitu- ents, we introduce {{the concept of a}} simple system, and derive additional {{relations among}} properties...|$|R

25|$|Certain sunnah prayers have {{prescribed}} waqts {{associated with}} them. Those ordained for before {{each of the}} fard prayers must be performed between the first call to prayer (adhan) and the second call (iqama), which signifies {{the start of the}} fard prayer. Those sunnah ordained for after the fard prayers can be performed any time between the end of the fard prayers {{and the end of the}} current prayer's waqt. <b>Any</b> <b>amount</b> of extra rakats may be offered, but most madha'ib prescribe a certain number of rakats for each sunnah salah.|$|E
25|$|Special stamps {{were printed}} for Parcel Post service {{to help in}} the effort of keeping {{accounts}} and revenues generated from general postage and the Parcel Post separate. The twelve Parcel Post stamps had three basic design themes that were associated with the Post Office and its delivery service. The denominations were such that <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> of postage up to one dollar could be made by using no more than three stamps. Three of the Parcel Post denominations—20 cents, 25 cents and 75 cents—were new to U. S. Postage.|$|E
25|$|Many {{artists are}} using the Internet to give away music to create {{awareness}} and liking to a new upcoming album. The artists release a new song {{on the internet for}} free download, which consumers can download. The hope is to have the listeners buy the new album because of the free download. A common practice used today is releasing a song or two on the internet for consumers to indulge. In 2007, Radiohead released an album named in Rainbows, in which fans could pay <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> they want, or download it for free.|$|E
50|$|A {{permitted}} {{system is}} required to be inspected. During construction the system is to be left uncovered. Additionally, implementation of certain devices can be prescribed in codes and requirements. A Reduced Pressure (RP) backflow device at property entry {{makes it easier to}} assess <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> of crossover between grey water and a potentially potable water supply.|$|R
50|$|An {{examiner}} {{can only}} certify expenses where he forms {{the opinion that}} {{the survival of the}} company as a going concern would otherwise be seriously prejudiced. Importantly, only liabilities incurred during the protection period can be certified. It {{should also be noted that}} the court has the discretion to review <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> certified by the examiner.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1998 case, the O'Farrell {{changed the}} performers' payment {{structure}} again: they posted a [...] "suggested" [...] fee of $20 per lap dance and $40 per private performance {{and set a}} [...] "quota" [...] of $360 per woman per night; the women were allowed to keep half the quota plus all tips. However, it has been recorded on some occasions for lap dances to {{cost as much as}} $240. Dancers claimed feeling pressured into paying $180 per night even if they had earned less than that amount, and another 370-plaintiff class-action suit began in 2002. In 2007, a judge ruled in favor of the dancers, declaring the quota system illegal and requiring the O'Farrell to pay <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> employees could show they paid to fill their quotas, minus <b>any</b> <b>amounts</b> the employer could show the dancers had collected but failed to report. The O'Farrell was also ordered to reimburse dancers for required theme-oriented costumes.|$|R
