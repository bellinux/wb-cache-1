5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case of}} EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety.
