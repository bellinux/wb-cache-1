ABSTRACT: An investigation {{was performed on}} using piezoelectrics built into laminated compos-ite structures to detect a delamination and estimate its size and location. Previously, a structural model was developed for predicting the output voltages from the sensors when a delaminated beam was excited by the actuators. In this sequel, a delamination identification method is presented which consists of the structural model, a response comparator and a damage selector. When damage is suspected, the structural model is run repeatedly to predict the changes in response due to dif-ferent possible delaminations. During these runs, delamination sizes and locations are selected randomly by the damage selector, {{which is based on}} an approach similar to the "simulated annealing algorithm " that improves agreement between the measured and calculated responses. In the re-sponse comparator, the agreement is quantified by using a weighted quadratic objective function. When the objective function is minimized, the responses agree, and the <b>assumed</b> <b>damage</b> is also a best estimate for the actual delamination dimensions. The method has been tested using re-sponses measured in the laboratory and has successfully identified artificially implanted beam delaminations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost of vibration-based damage {{detection}} methods require the modal properties that are obtained from measured signals {{through the system}} identification techniques. However, the modal properties such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are not such a good sensitive indication of structural damage. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is a mathematical tool that has a special advantage over the traditional Fourier transform in analyzing non-stationary signals. It adopts redundant basis functions and hence can provide an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. In this study, a {{damage detection}} index called wavelet packet energy rate index (WPERI), is proposed for the damage detection of beam structures. The measured dynamic signals are decomposed into the wavelet packet components and the wavelet energy rate index is computed to indicate the structural damage. The proposed damage identification method is firstly illustrated with a simulated simply supported beam and the identified damage is satisfactory with <b>assumed</b> <b>damage.</b> Afterward, the method {{is applied to the}} tested steel beams with three damage scenarios in the laboratory. Despite the noise is present for real measurement data, the identified damage pattern is comparable with the tests.

We analyzed magnetic properties of unstructured aggregates with randomly distributed nanoparticles with random direction of polarization in the aggregates and of structured model of aggregates with orderly distributed nanoparticles and with arranged directions of polarization. In the case of structured model, resulting magnetic forces approach to zero. Since we suppose that magnetic field of iron particles has significant influence on the rate of aggregation [19], the structured model is not sufficient.

40|$|Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are {{recognized}} as an alternative class of computational model, which mimic natural evolution to solve problems in a wide domain including machine learning, music generation, genetic synthesis etc. In the present study Genetic Algorithm has been employed to obtain damage assessment of composite structural elements. It is considered that a state of damage can be modeled as reduction in stiffness. The task {{is to determine the}} magnitude and location of damage. In a composite plate that is discretized into a set of finite elements, if a jth element is damaged, the GA based technique will predict the reduction in Ex and Ey and the location j. The fact that the natural frequency decreases with decrease in stiffness is made use of in the method. The natural frequency of any two modes of the damaged plates for the <b>assumed</b> <b>damage</b> parameters is facilitated by the use of Eigen sensitivity analysis. The Eigen value sensitivities are the derivatives of the Eigen values with respect to certain design parameters. If ωiu is the natural frequency of the ith mode of the undamaged plate and ωid is that of the damaged plate, with δωi as the difference between the two, while δωk is a similar difference in the kth mode, R is defined as the ratio of the two.

Two damage spectral elements (DSE 1 and DSE 2) are developed to model the local (cracks in reinforcement bar) and global (debonding between reinforcement bar and concrete) damage in one-dimensional homogeneous and composite waveguide, respectively. Transfer matrix method is adopted to assemble the stiffness matrix of multiple spectral elements. In order to solve the inverse problem, clonal selection algorithm {{is used for the}} optimization calculations. Two displacement-based functions and two frequency-based functions are used as objective functions in this study. Numerical simulations of wave propagation in a bare steel bar and in a reinforcement bar without and with various <b>assumed</b> <b>damage</b> scenarios are carried out.

Results show that local damage is easy to be identified by using any considered objective function with the proposed method while only using the wavelet energy-based objective function gives reliable identification of global damage. The method is then extended to identify multiple damages in a structure. To further verify the proposed method, experiments of wave propagation in a rectangular steel bar before and after damage are conducted. The proposed method is used to update the structural model for damage identification.

40|$|ABSTRACT Strong {{evidence}} {{supports the idea}} that fatty acids rather than carbohydrates are {{the main energy source}} of Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis during infection and latency. Despite that important role, a complete scenario of the bacterium’s metabolism when lipids are the main energy source is still lacking. Here we report the development of an in vitro model to analyze adapta-tion of M. tuberculosis during assimilation of long-chain fatty acids as sole carbon sources. The global lipid transcriptome re-vealed a shift toward the glyoxylate cycle, the overexpression of main regulators whiB 3, dosR, and Rv 0081, and the increased ex-pression of several genes related to reductive stress. Our evidence showed that lipid storage seems to be the selected mechanism used by M. tuberculosis to ameliorate the <b>assumed</b> <b>damage</b> of reductive stress and that concomitantly the bacilli acquired a slowed-growth and drug-tolerant phenotype, all characteristics previously associated with the dormant stage. Additionally, in-tergenic regions were also detected, including the unexpected upregulation of tRNAs that suggest a new role for these molecules in the acquisition of a drug-tolerant phenotype by dormant bacilli. Finally, a set of lipid signature genes for the adaptation pro-cess was also identified. This in vitro model represents a suitable condition to illustrate the participation of reductive stress in drugs ’ activity against dormant bacilli, an aspect scarcely investigated to date. This approach provides a new perspective to the understanding of latent infection and suggests the participation of previously undetected molecules.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} performed and analyzed {{in order to}} examine the onset and evolution of damage processes in thin isotropic paper sheets made of mechanical pulp. A microscopy technique has been used to estimate the relative fraction of bond and fibre breaks. It has been found that the active damage mechanism is bond failure, hence supporting the assumption of an isotropic scalar valued damage variable. All experiments have been performed by simultaneous with the mechanical loading monitoring the acoustic emission activity. Three different experimental setups have been designed offering the possibility to analyze the influence of stress gradients, as well as different levels of the ratios between the in-plane normal stresses, on the onset of damage. It is concluded that stress gradients in the paper specimens have a large influence on the onset of damage. When stress gradients are present a non-local theory has {{to be used in the}} analysis. In this way compliance with an isotropic damage criterion is achieved. The characteristic length, determining the gradient sensitivity, has been found to be of the same order of magnitude as some average fibre length. To study the evolution of the damage processes, wide and short specimens have been loaded in tension resulting in stable damage processes. With the assumptions made regarding the mechanical behavior of the paper material after onset of damage, the damage and the cumulative number of acoustic events curve correlates very well. The experimentally obtained data is used to determine material parameters in a proposed damage evolution law. It is found that the <b>assumed</b> <b>damage</b> evolution law can, for isotropic paper materials with bond rupture as the prevalent failure mechanism, be further simplified as only one specific material dependent damage evolution parameter has to be determined in experiments...|$|E

They were {{born on the}} same day, look very much alike, grow in the same way, and, unless one of them becomes {{severely}} ill {{and has to be}} removed, they will also die on the same day. Yet, when one examines them closely, one finds subtle anatomical differences betwen them. Moreover, their pathology is not the same: Disturbances may be vastly different according to which of them is damaged. For a long time this asymmetry between the two cerebral hemispheres was not recognized. In 1874 Hughlings Jackson observed that 'not long ago few doubted the brain to be double in function as well as physically bilateral'. In {{the second part of the}} 19 th century it was dicovered that damage to the left half of the brain is likely to entail far more severe language disorders than damage to the right half. The difference was so striking that the left hemisphere came to be regarded as the seat of verbal functions while the right hemisphere was deemed 'uneducated in words'. This, it must be noted, applied only ro right-handers. In left-handers the situation was reversed: The right hemisphere was dominant for language. In the last decades, however, it has become increasingly clear that cerebral organization is more complex and more varied than was imagined at first. Cerebral dominance for language in sinistrals is not always the reverse of what is observed in dextrals. Indeed, there may be various degrees of cerebral dominance for language. Moreover, even in people in whom a pronounced lateralization of verbal functions may be <b>assumed,</b> <b>damage</b> to the minor hemisphere will not leave the use of language completely unimpaired.
