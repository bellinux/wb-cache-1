50|$|To create rewritable {{paper the}} {{researchers}} used four oxazolidines. Some of the isomers of these oxazolidines are colourless {{in the absence}} of water. But when the paper is wetted the water changes the dyes’ absorption of visible light. The exact wavelengths absorbed vary with the compound used, which allows printing in a variety of colours. The rewriteable paper was made by first coating ordinary paper with <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) to prevent it reacting with the dye, before a second layer of PEG containing the chosen dye was laid on top. Finally, another layer of PEG was added to prevent the dye absorbing water from the air or, conversely, losing water too quickly. The team used a commercial inkjet printer and a cartridge filled with water to print trial documents. The printed page is dry to the touch and the print can be rapidly ‘erased’ by heating it to 70 °C. The print remained legible for around 22 hours before evaporation wiped the page clean. Paper prepared in this way can be printed on and then erased more than 50 times.|$|E

It is found that by applying a large current to the organic-inorganic semiconductor rectifying heterojunction structure Au/PEDT:PSS/SiAu∕PEDT:PSS∕Si, the ratio of PEDT+PEDT+ to PSS−PSS− near the interface changes due to phase segregation in the presence of both high electric field (> 105  V/cm) (> 105 V∕cm) and temperature.

An {{impedance}} pneumograph {{capable of}} quantitatively measuring respiratory volumes is described. Physically, the pneumograph {{is one of}} several 3 / 8 x 5 / 8 x 7 / 8 inches modules incorporated in a miniature biotelemetry system, with separate modules being utilized to process signals derived from a number of physiological parameters such as EEG and EKG in addition to respiration. Considerable experimentation was performed regarding optimization of the electrodes used in this impedance pneumograph as well as the frequency and amplitude of the excitation voltage applied between the electrodes. The result was a fairly simple and inexpensive device which uses a higher frequency (300 KHz) excitation voltage than is normally used in impedance pneumography. The two electrodes, constructed of silver coated nylon for flexibility, are insulated from the subject by <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> film, thus forming a capacitive coupling of the electrode to the subject. This technique effectively eliminates changes in skin-to-electrode resistance, largely responsible for baseline drift encountered with previous impedance systems, so that this pneumograph responds only to variations in the actual impedance between the two electrodes. Empirically, a nearly perfect linear correlation was found to exist between the transthoracic impedance measured by this impedance pneumograph and pulmonary volume.

40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} interactions between cells and material surfaces {{are essential to}} design biocompatible and functional medical implants. To this end, bioactive surfaces preventing non-specific biological reactions and providing signals that guide cell behavior are designed. Interactions between surfaces and endothelial cells are particularly important for biomedical applications such as endothelialization of vascular grafts {{and the development of}} vascularized artificial tissues by tissue engineering. The aim of this research project is then to develop a bioactive surface specifically interacting with endothelial cells by developing and using arrays of polymers and bioactive surfaces. Arrays of carboxy-methyl-dextran (CMD) are made to determine a low-fouling surface preventing non-specific protein adsorption and cell adhesion. CMD layers are grafted with various conditions and are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), exposed to proteins and then fibroblasts, to identify immobilization parameters that influence layers structure and ability to resist non-specific interactions.

A series of diaminobutane poly(propylenimine) generation 3 dendrimer (DAB-dendr-(NH 2) (16)) amphiphiles has been synthesized, hearing ail average of five (PD 5), three (PD 3) and one (PD 1) palmitoyl group(s) per dendrimer molecule. Additionally DAB-dendr-(NH 2) (16) was derivatized with <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> glycol) (PEG, degree of polymerization = 12) groups and conjugated {{to an average of}} 1 palmitoyl group at the PEG end (PPD 1).

The critical micellar concentration in aqueous media followed the trend: DPD 5 < PD 5 = PD 3 < PD 1 < PPD 1 and amphiphiles eventually formed 10 - 20 nm monomolecular or multimolecular micelles and/or 200 nm spheres or tubules. Aggregation was entropy driven, as expected, for DPD 5, PD 5 and PD 1 and enthalpy driven with the most hydrophilic Compound PPD 1, but was unexpectedly enthalpy driven for PD 3. PD 3 aggregates formed low capacity hydrophobic domains with a limited capacity for encapsulation of cyclosporine A; encapsulation levels (mole drug per mole polymer) were 0. 099, 0. 014, 0, 099, and 0. 735 for PD 1, PD 3, PD 5, and DPD 5 and, respectively. We conclude that star shaped amphiphiles such as PD 3 are sterically hindered from self-assembling into high capacity hydrophobic domains in aqueous media, Amphiphile-membrane interactions were promoted by hydrophobic groups, but diminished by PEG moieties. DPD 5 is the most suitable amphiphile for biomedical application...|$|E
40|$|With the {{industry}} striving for smaller devices, new technologies are developed to further miniaturize electronics devices. To this end, realization of 3 D/non-planar interconnects, which aim at miniaturizing the interconnects formed between components {{on the same}} device, has attracted many researchers. This thesis focuses on a feasibility analysis for developing non-planar interconnects on various flexible substrates using laser assisted maskless microdeposition (LAMM), which is a pressure-less process. There {{are two types of}} flexible substrates that are used: double-sided copper substrates separated by <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> terephthalate (PET) as well as a polyethylene terephthalate flexible substrate with surface-mounted resistors. For both substrates, multiple types of experiments were conducted to discover procedures which result in the highest rate of success for forming conductive interconnects. Optimal process parameters and deposition techniques were determined after multiple experiments. After experiments were completed, the resultant substrates were subject to various characterization methodologies including optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and profilometery. The results of these methodologies are documented in this thesis. After many types of experiments involving substrate manipulation of the double-sided copper substrates, it was shown that the silver nano-particles were more likely to form a conductive interconnect when a polished slant was fabricated on the substrate. Many deposition patterns were used for the flexible substrates with surface-mounted resistors. Of these patterns, the two patterns, the ‘zigzag’ and ‘dot solder’ patterns, proved to have a much higher success rate for creating conductive interconnects compared to the other patterns. During this study, the results of the experiments using the LAMM process show that this technology has great potential for creating non-planar interconnects on flexible substrates. The experiments however suggest that the process is very sensitive to the material composition and process parameters. As such, with a small change in parameters, the 3 D interconnects can fail to be produced. It was also observed that the possibility of silver interconnect fractures is higher where dissimilar materials with different thermal expansion rates are used for the underlying substrates...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{respond to}} {{adhesive}} and soluble cues in the extracellular matrix by modulating their behaviour including cell adhesion, migration speed and direction. In vivo, cells {{are exposed to}} multiple, even conflicting directional cues, however, how cell migration is influenced by multiple spatial cues is still unclear. The effects of adhesive and soluble cues on cell adhesion and migration have often been studied separately. In this thesis, surface-patterning techniques and microfluidics are combined to independently present adhesive and soluble cues. Microcontact printing was used to pattern adhesive cues onto <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) that passivated the underlying surfaces. A microfluidic device was employed to deliver a gradient of soluble cues to migrating cells. Migration of Hela cells derived from human cervical cancer and J 774 cells, immortalized mouse macrophages, was recorded with live-cell fluorescence microscopy and analysis by single cell tracking. In the first chapter reporting results (Chapter 3), surface passivation and surface patterning of fibronectin via microcontact printing were established and cell migration was observed with a modified wound assay. It is shown that HeLa cells required fibronectin for adhesion and migration and did not migrate into passivated PEG regions of the surface. Only when the cell density on the fibronectin tracks was high did individual HeLa cells migrate into PEG regions. Conversely, J 774 cells migrated faster on PEG regions than on fibronectin tracks. The distinct cell morphology indicated that J 774 may adopt different migrating modes on fibronectin and PEG surfaces. In Chapter 4, the modified surfaces from Chapter 3 were integrated with a microfluidic device to create a gradient of fetal bovine serum (FBS) or complement 5 a (C 5 a) as a soluble cue for chemotaxis. Hence this chapter describes the role of patterned surfaces and directional cue of soluble gradients on chemotaxis. HeLa cells were found to migrate towards higher concentrations of FBS, but only when a fibronectin track was accessible in that direction. It was concluded that chemotaxis of HeLa cells is strongly adhesion dependent. In contrast, J 774 cells migrated faster and more directed towards the source of C 5 a on fibronectin tracks than on PEG regions, suggesting that chemotaxis of macrophages is enhanced on adhesive cues. In Chapter 5, two competing directional cues were presented to migrating cells. These were (i) gradients of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides immobilised onto streptavidin tracks printed on PEG passivated surfaces and (ii) soluble chemoattractant gradient introduced with the microfluidic device used in Chapter 4. When RGD gradients and FBS gradients opposed each other, a greater fraction of HeLa cells was found to migrate towards the source of FBS rather than towards higher concentrations of RGD peptides. Hence for HeLa cells, {{in the presence of}} any adhesive cues, soluble cues were dominant in determining the direction of migration. J 774 cells on RGD gradients and PEG regions were found to migrate randomly despite the presence of a chemoattractant gradient. In conclusion, combining microcontact printing and microfluidics described in this thesis revealed novel insights of how HeLa and J 774 cells integrate multiple spatial cues environment and modulate their migration behaviour accordingly...|$|E

This approach is only suitable if the layer can be made to resonate by the available ultrasonic frequencies; typically this will be the case for thicker coatings (tens of microns).

In this study, we functionalized PVA films with SNO groups via esterification {{with a mixture of}} mercaptosucinic acid (MSA) and thiolactic acid (TLA) followed by S-nitrosation of the -SH moieties. These films were combined with <b>an</b> underlying <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) -poly(ethylene oxide), i. e., PEO-PPO-PEO (Pluronic F 127) hydrogel and used for the topical treatment of skin lesions in an animal model. The mixed esterification of PVA with MSA and TLA led to chemically crosslinked PVA-SNO films with a high swelling capacity capable of spontaneously releasing NO. Real time NO-release measurements revealed that the hydrogel layer reduces the initial NO burst from the PVA-SNO films. We demonstrate that the combination of PVA-SNO films with F 127 hydrogel accelerates wound contraction, decreases wound gap and cellular density and accelerates the inflammatory phase of the lesion. These results were reflected in an increase in myofibroblastic differentiation and collagen type III expression in the cicatricial tissue. Therefore, PVA-SNO films combined with F 127 hydrogel may represent a new approach for active wound dressings capable of accelerating wound healing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Herein, novel hybrid {{nanomaterials}} {{were developed}} for wound dressing applications with antimicrobial properties. Electrospinning {{was used to}} fabricate <b>a</b> double <b>layer</b> nanocomposite nanofibrous mat consisting <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upper <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> poly(vinyl alcohol) and chitosan loaded with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and <b>a</b> lower <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> oxide (PEO) or polyvinylpyr- rolidone (PVP) nanofibers loaded with chlorhexidine (as an antiseptic). The top layer containing AgNPs, whose purpose was to protect the wound site against environmental germ invasion, was prepared by reducing silver nitrate to its nanoparticulate form through interaction with chitosan. The lower layer, which would be {{in direct contact with}} the injured site, contained the antibi- otic drug needed to avoid wound infections which would otherwise interfere with the healing process. Initially, the upper layer was electrospun, followed sequentially by electrospinning the second <b>layer,</b> creating <b>a</b> bilayer nanofibrous mat. The morphology of the nanofibrous mats was studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, showing successful nanofiber production. X-ray diffraction confirmed the reduction of silver nitrate to AgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a successful incorporation of the material used in the produced nanofibrous mats. Thermal studies carried out by thermogravi- metric analysis indicated that the PVP–drug-loaded layer had the highest thermal stability in comparison to other fabricated nanofibrous mats. Antimicrobial activities of the as-synthesized nanofibrous mats against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans were determined using disk diffusion method. The results indicated that the PEO–drug-loaded mat had the highest antibacterial activity, warranting further attention for numerous wound-healing applications. QUST-CAS-SPR- 145 -...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} experimentally {{a method}} to enable prediction of depth of a chemical species buried in a turbid medium by using transmission Raman spectroscopy alone. The method allows the prediction of the depth of a single, chemically distinct <b>layer</b> within <b>a</b> turbid matrix by performing two measurements, with and without a beam enhancing element, or "photon diode. " The samples employed consisted of two different polymers, of total thickness 3. 6 [*]mm, whose optical properties are loosely relevant to pharmaceutical applications. <b>A</b> polymer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> low-density <b>polyethylene</b> (LDPE) was placed at different positions within multiple <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix and Raman spectra were recorded in each case.

40|$|Control of {{the precise}} {{location}} {{and extent of}} cellular attachment and proliferation, and of tissue outgrowth is important {{in a number of}} biomedical applications, including biomaterials and tissue engineered medical devices. Here we describe a method to control and direct the location and define boundaries of tissue growth on surfaces in two dimensions. The method relies on the generation of a spatially defined surface chemistry comprising protein adsorbing and non-adsorbing areas that allow control over the adsorption of cell-adhesive glycoproteins. Surface modification was carried out by deposition of thin acetaldehyde and allylamine plasma polymer coatings on silicon wafer and FEP substrates, followed by grafting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein resistant <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide). Spatially controlled patterning of the surface chemistry was achieved by masking during plasma polymerization. XPS and AFM were used to provide evidence of successful surface modifications. Adsorption of the extracellular matrix protein collagen I followed by tissue outgrowth experiments with bovine corneal epithelial tissue for up to 21 days showed that two-dimensional control over tissue outgrowth is achievable with our patterning method over extended time frames. The method promises to be an effective tool for use in a number of in vitro and in vivo applications...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To provide cytospins as a {{means of}} {{external}} quality assurance (EQA), while maintaining antigen expression integrity and achieving uniformity of material for all participating laboratories. METHODS: Cells were collected from two adenocarcinoma and one reactive pleural effusion specimens. Lymphoid cells were also collected through aspiration of a resected tonsil specimen. All cells were collected in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS); cytospins were made and fixed in methanol or acetone alone or protected using <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> 10 % <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) in 50 % methanol. Two laboratories participated (RGHT and UCL). RESULTS: Cytokeratin expression detected using either CAM 5. 2 or AE 1 /AE 3 antibodies was sensitive to temperature. Without PEG, unacceptable or negative staining was seen within six weeks of preparation. LCA was not sensitive to temperature, with good staining scores being achieved after eight weeks following preparation. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to send alcohol fixed, air dried cytospins to laboratories participating as part of an EQA scheme for immunocytology. Some antigens will require protection from temperature variations during transit. <b>A</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> 10 % PEG in 50 % methanol, allowed to air dry, is suitable for this purpose. Participating laboratories will only have to remove this layer using methanol before their localisation technique for assessment...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} here a {{new method}} {{to control the}} location of cells on surfaces in two dimensions, which {{can be applied to}} a number of biomedical applications including diagnostic tests and tissue engineered medical devices. Two-dimensional control over cell attachment is achieved by generation of a spatially controlled surface chemistry that allows control over protein adsorption, a process which mediates cell attachment. Here, we describe the deposition of thin allylamine plasma polymer coatings on silicon wafer and perfluorinated poly(ethylene-co-propylene) substrates, followed by grafting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein resistant <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide). Spatially controlled patterning of the surface chemistry was achieved in a fast, one-step procedure by nanometer thickness controlled laser ablation using a 248 nm excimer laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to confirm the production of surface chemistry patterns with a resolution of approximately 1 µm, which is significantly below the dimensions of a single mammalian cell. Subsequent adsorption of the extracellular matrix proteins collagen I and fibronectin followed by cell culture experiments using bovine corneal epithelial cells confirmed that cell attachment is controlled by the surface chemistry pattern. The method is an effective tool for use in a number of in vitro and in vivo applications...|$|R
5000|$|Hot {{cells are}} {{commonly}} used in the nuclear medicines industry:- {{for the production of}} radiopharmaceuticals, according to GMP guidelines (industry)- for the manipulation and dispense of radiopharmaceuticals (hospitals).The user must never be subject to shine paths that are emitted from the radioactive isotopes and therefore there generally is heavy shielding around the containment boxes, which can be made out of stainless steel 316 or other materials such as PVC or Corian. This shielding can be ensured by the use of lead (common) or materials such as concrete (very large walls are therefore required) or even tungsten. The amount of radioactivity present in the hot cell, the energy of the gamma photons emitted by the radioisotopes, and the number of neutrons that are formed by the material will prescribe how thick the shielding must be. For instance a [...] source of cobalt-60 will require thicker shielding than a [...] source of iridium-192 to give the same dose rate at the outer surface of the hot cell. Also if some actinide materials such as californium or spent nuclear fuel are used within the hot cell then <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> water or <b>polyethylene</b> may be needed to lower the neutron dose rate.|$|R
