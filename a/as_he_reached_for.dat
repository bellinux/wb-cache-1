5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
25|$|He {{was remarkably}} {{consistent}} {{once he had}} won his first team place, {{but when he was}} injured it came about in unusual circumstances. Playing against Middlesex at Lord's, he fell off a chair in the dressing-room <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his clothes and broke his wrist, missing the remainder of the summer of 1921. His benefit match in 1922 against Kent at Headingley, Leeds raised £1,891 and he hit the winning runs, after scoring 20 of the 24 required to win, to secure victory by ten wickets. He suffered from sciatica {{in the latter part of}} his career, and he played his last match for Yorkshire in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|The Slater-Morrill Shoe Company factory {{was located}} on Pearl Street in Braintree, Massachusetts. On April 15, 1920, {{two men were}} robbed and killed while {{transporting}} the company's payroll in two large steel boxes to the main factory. One of them, Alessandro Berardelli—a security guard—was shot four times <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his hip-holstered [...]38-caliber, Harrington & Richardson revolver; his gun was not recovered from the scene. The other man, Frederick Parmenter—a paymaster who was unarmed—was shot twice: once {{in the chest and}} a second time, fatally, in the back as he attempted to flee. The robbers seized the payroll boxes and escaped in a stolen dark blue Buick that sped up and was carrying several other men. As the car was being driven away, the robbers fired wildly at company workers nearby.|$|E

5000|$|In the 13th century Old Norse Thiðrekssaga, Hildibrand defeats his son, Alibrand. Alibrand {{offers his}} sword in {{surrender}} but attempts to strike Hildibrand <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> it. Hildibrand taunts him {{for having been}} taught to fight by a woman, but then asks if he is Alibrand and they are reconciled.|$|R

60|$|Spike's eye gleamed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the decanter. He took a seat.|$|E
60|$|Deacon {{could not}} speak. His throat lumped {{and he nodded}} his head <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the cards.|$|E

50|$|After {{the player}} manages to survive through {{numerous}} challenges, many {{reminiscent of the}} challenges faced by Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, he collects several artifacts, presumably of great value. At {{the very end of}} the game, he finds the ultimate artifact of the pyramid. However, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> it, the pyramid collapses around him and the game ends.|$|R
5000|$|Antonello da Messina's Madonna and Child is superficially {{very like}} that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both {{the mother and the}} child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The {{foreshortened}} elbow of the Child <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's Doni Tondo.|$|R
50|$|A {{wealthy man}} is shot just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> {{the phone to}} call for the police. Suspicion falls on his ward (Lila Lee) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has {{intended}} to change his will, which had left his entire estate to her, to share it equally with his nephew. The nephew, who {{is in love with}} Lee, calls in a private detective, who eventually finds it is the lawyer who is the criminal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some varmint's been chasin' the horses," [...] he said, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his saddle. [...] "Did {{you hear}} them snortin' an' runnin' last night?" ...|$|E
60|$|Quickly {{and silently}} he stepped toward the door, but, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the knob {{to throw it}} open, his wife's hand fell upon his wrist.|$|E
60|$|Cicely {{smiled back}} at him. Her face was scarlet, for the {{coupling}} of their names, and Drexley's quiet smile, was significant. But Douglas only laughed gaily <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his hat, and drew Cicely's feather boa around her with a little air of protection.|$|E
6000|$|Little Joe laughed. [...] "What's the matter, Jerry? 'Fraid I'll eat it all {{up before}} you get here?" [...] <b>he</b> asked, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>for</b> the fish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a minute," [...] {{she checked}} him, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> desperately <b>for</b> the razor. [...] "I've been {{watching}} the barbers from the sidewalk. This is what they do after the lather is on." ...|$|R
25|$|Near the {{beginning}} of their second winter the Skraelings come again to trade. This time one of Karlsefni's men kills a Skraeling <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> Norse weapons. The Skraelings run off. Karlsefni fears the natives will return, hostile and in larger numbers. He forms a plan for the coming battle. The Skraelings do come again and the Norsemen manage to fight them off. Karlsefni stays there {{for the remainder of the}} winter and returns to Greenland next spring. During their stay in Vinland, Karlsefni and Gudrid had the son Snorri.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty {{early to}} go to bed," [...] he thought <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his watch to note the time, running his fingers into an empty pocket. Gingerly he felt in another pocket, where he knew his watch couldn't {{possibly}} be, nor was. Carefully Jimmy examined each pocket of his coat and trousers, a slow and broad grin illumining his face.|$|E
60|$|To those {{wishing to}} know how this was {{accomplished}} he would say they were purely tricks of dexterity. Carl had the articles mentioned about his person and concealed them in his hand <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> Leo’s mouth. A handkerchief and a baseball cap can be rolled into very small balls when it is necessary, and even a frog is small when tightly held.|$|E
6000|$|It {{occurred}} to the journalist that Mr. Heckshill had the reputation, in his earlier career, of [...] "taking" [...] {{such things as}} unoccupied lands and timber [...] "as he found them," [...] without much reference to their actual owners. Apparently he was acting upon the same principle now, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the demijohn of whiskey with the ingenuous pleasantry, [...] "Did somebody say whiskey, or did I dream it?" ...|$|E
50|$|While drunk, Captain Jonsen makes {{a sexual}} {{overture}} to Emily. She bites his hand before anything happens, {{but she is}} frightened by the look in Jonsen's eye <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> her. The author gives no explicit details for her fright, just a veiled description from Emily's point of view. Emily later suffers an injury to her leg, in an accident caused by Rachel, and is confined to the captain's cabin. Meanwhile, Margaret, who has become alienated from the other children, becomes Otto's concubine and moves into his cabin.|$|R
50|$|Venturing {{inside the}} city they {{eventually}} discover a shining black and white jewel of incredible workmanship. Hung next to it is a plain stone talisman which the two ignore. Up until this point, Moriana and Fost have avoided {{the question of who}} will take the amulet, but the matter is resolved when Moriana stabs Fost through the heart <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> it. Sobbing with grief, Moriana folds Fost's hands over the unremarkable stone, which he grasped in his death throes, and takes the black and white jewel before leaving the city in the company of Ziore, the ghost of an embittered nun who once followed Erimenes' teachings of denial.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I've {{made you}} turn out {{things that are}} like {{something}} on earth, my boy," [...] he said proudly. [...] "And that," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>for</b> the bottle of Bourbon which Kirk had provided for him, [...] "is going some." ...|$|R
60|$|With a snarl {{more like}} that of a tiger than of a human being, Miller sprang at Clarke. His face was dark with {{malignant}} hatred, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> and drew an ugly knife. There were cries of fright from the children and screams from the women. Alfred stepped aside with the wonderful quickness of the trained boxer and shot out his right arm. His fist caught Miller a hard blow on the head, knocking him down and sending the knife flying in the air.|$|E
60|$|In the {{reaction}} that followed he realized how high his hopes had been. It {{seemed as if}} Fortune had but played with him, had put the prize almost within his grasp and then <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> it had snatched it away to tease and mock him. He could have cried with vexation and disappointment had he been of the weeping kind. As it was he swallowed a lump in his throat and leaned forward to peer through the brush for one last glimpse of the royal animal.|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{put aside}} the harness on which he was sewing, opened the door, and saw Sally and Bright spiritedly driving away a bunch of {{foraging}} sled-dogs {{that belonged to the}} next cabin. Also he saw something else that made him close the door hurriedly and dash to the stove. The frying-pan, still hot from the moose-meat and bacon, he put back on the front lid. Into the frying-pan he put a generous dab of butter, then reached for an egg, which he broke and dropped spluttering into the pan. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a second egg, Shorty gained his side and clutched his arm in an excited grip.|$|E
50|$|Jason's {{first task}} is to {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of the}} super-villain Orca. His investigation reveals that Orca was married to Terry Capshaw. Jason meets with Terry to find out what he could about Orca's disappearance. During their conversation, Terry is shot and killed by the Tally Man, who then shoots Jason in the arm <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> his gun. As Jason lies on the floor, the Tally Man aims his gun and fires, but Jason is able to knock him down. Using his cane and karate, Jason subdues the Tally Man and calls Batman to inform the Dark Knight of his progress, only to learn that Harvey Dent is, once again, Two-Face.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw away}} the stump of his cigar and rose, turning <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> the corner <b>for</b> a {{lingering}} {{glance at the}} Fair Emily.|$|R
6000|$|... "So--help--me--God!" [...] he whispered, {{with blood}} thick in his voice. Then darkly, <b>as</b> one groping, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her with shaking hands. [...] "Y'u--y'u white-throated hussy!... I'll ..." ...|$|R
60|$|The old gun-man {{started as}} if he had seen ghosts. His hands grew clawlike <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the guns. He threw open the cylinders, spilled out the shells, snapped back the cylinders. Then he went through motions too swift for Shefford to follow. But Shefford heard the hammers falling so swiftly they blended their clicks almost in one sound. Lassiter reloaded the guns with a speed {{comparable}} with the other actions. A remarkable transformation had come over him. He did not seem the same man. The mild eyes had changed; the long, shadowy, sloping lines were tense cords; and there was a cold, ashy shade on his face.|$|E
6000|$|Fosh-bal-soj was {{possessed of}} {{enormous}} strength {{and he was}} fighting for his life. The Englishman soon realized that the battle was going against him. Already his lungs were pounding painfully for air <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his pistol. It was with difficulty that he drew it from its holster, and even then, with death staring him in the face, {{he thought of his}} precious ammunition. [...] "Can't waste it," [...] he thought; and slipping his fingers to the barrel he raised the weapon and struck Fosh-bal-soj a terrific blow between the eyes. Instantly the clawlike fingers released their hold, and the creature sank limply to the floor beside Bradley, who lay for several minutes gasping painfully in an effort to regain his breath.|$|E
60|$|Temporarily, at least, he {{had saved}} {{the life of}} his subject, and now he turned his {{attention}} toward insuring his own safety. Inextricably entangled in the mess to which he was clinging were numerous other landing hooks such as he had attached to the warrior's harness, and with one of these he sought to secure himself until the storm should abate sufficiently to permit him to climb to the deck, but even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> one that swung near him the ship was caught in a renewed burst of the storm's fury, the thrashing cordage whipped and snapped to the lunging of the great craft and one of the heavy metal hooks, lashing through the air, struck the Jed of Gathol fair between the eyes.|$|E
5000|$|After having {{arrived home}} from the Rosewood Police Department in [...] "EscApe from New York", Melissa wonders how long Spencer has known about Alison being alive. She {{believes}} that Ali is a “walking time bomb” and when she explodes, everyone around her gets hurt. Struggling with what she shared to Peter back at the station, Melissa almost divulges her secret to Veronica, but before she can do so, red and blue lights flash at the window, cutting her off. Later, Melissa informs her father {{that she wants to}} tell Holbrook the truth. She adds that when Spencer finds out, she’ll have a reason to come home. Finishing his drink, Peter stands, towering over Melissa <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> the bottle of alcohol behind her, and tells Veronica can't find out the truth. He then walks away.|$|R
50|$|Knowing that Dai {{will send}} people to kill Wei Fang, Snow Vase frees him, and is horrified to later hear {{that he has}} stolen the sword. Silent Wolf tracks the boy down and they fight on a frozen lake. Wei Fang's master, Iron Crow, arrives and wounds Silent Wolf, {{allowing}} Wei Fang to escape and reach West Lotus. Wei Fang offers the sword to Hades Dai, but then attempts to kill him with it to avenge his mother. Shu Lien and the others arrive and fight Dai's army. Shu Lien fights the enchantress and kills her, using her skills {{to see through the}} witch's illusions. Mantis kills Flying Blade and Thunder Fist, then fights Snow Vase, who defeats her but is badly wounded. Silent Wolf fights Hades Dai on the tower, eventually killing the warlord with his own sword <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> the Green Destiny.|$|R
5000|$|Megatron goes {{looking for}} Optimus Prime by {{destroying}} the city, instead finding Sam and Mikeala hiding. Optimus appears and intervenes before Megatron can kill them, {{to have the}} last battle. Eventually, Megatron injures Optimus badly, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> the All Spark, Megatron stands in the way. He lowers his flail, and can tell Optimus what happens now. He raises the flail, swings it around his head once, then swings it into Prime. Prime's optical display flickers for seconds, showing all of his past recordings before, flickering out, along with his Spark. With Optimus dead, Sam and the other humans remain unharmed, as Megatron is seen activating the All Spark, then releases a massive shockwave, presumably converting all the electronics in the world into Decepticons, and uses the new army to take over Earth. The story ends sometime later, with Megatron ordering all Decepticons to kill the last of Mankind from his [...] "throne" [...] before they leave Earth.|$|R
