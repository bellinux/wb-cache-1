5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E

5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{use of an}} {{alternative}} history concept, with the Axis victory in World War II, was commended by many reviewers.

Even so, the constant movement of the components on-camera {{made it difficult to}} achieve a seamless transition between the two 60-second shots. Several sections also required minor video editing, such as re-centering the frame to stay closer to the action, removal of wires, highlighting a spray of water, and adjusting the pace for dramatic purposes.|$|E

500|$|In the 2010–11 season, Roma {{suffered}} {{yet another}} defeat to Inter in the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana, continuing their [...] "traditional" [...] early struggles, which Totti partly blamed on Ranieri's defensive mindset {{and failure to}} develop a consistent set of tactics. On a personal level, Totti won the Golden Foot award, but Ranieri's lack of faith in him due to his age meant that the captain would spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the substitute's bench in favour of younger forwards, such as Marco Borriello, Mirko Vučinić and Jérémy Ménez. His limited playing time, which included a controversial 91st minute substitution in a 2–1 away loss against Sampdoria, resulted in several clashes with Ranieri, and saw him fall out of form, scoring only three league goals in 21 appearances; {{as a result of}} his limited appearances, despondance and strenuous relationship with the manager, rumours even circulated in the media that Totti was considering leaving Roma. Following Roma's 4–3 loss against Genoa on 20 February 2011, Ranieri resigned as manager of Roma, and Totti saw his former teammate Vincenzo Montella appointed as caretaker coach.|$|E
500|$|Monkey lemurs, or baboon lemurs, share {{similarities}} with macaques, {{although they}} have also been compared to baboons.

[...] Their robust jaws and specialized teeth suggest a diet of hard objects, such as nuts and seeds, yet other evidence, including fecal pellets, suggests they may have had a more varied diet, including leaves, fruit, and animal matter (omnivory). [...] Dental wear analysis has shed some light on this dietary mystery, suggesting that monkey lemurs had a more eclectic diet, while using tough seeds as a fall-back food item. [...] Within the family, the genus Archaeolemur was the most widespread in distribution, resulting in hundreds of subfossil specimens, and may {{have been one of the}} last subfossil lemurs to die out.|$|E

500|$|In the {{behind the}} scenes video {{published}} by HBO following the airing of the fifth and sixth episodes, Benioff described Bran's visions {{at the beginning of}} the episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully, noting [...] "Even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen. And the Mad King was probably the most dramatic of those because we've been hearing about the Mad King from the very beginning of the show, but he's never appeared on screen before. And shooting it, you know, spending <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> what ended up being maybe like a second and a half, couple seconds, of screen time." [...] The new scenes of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, are interspersed with previously shown footage of the White Walkers, as well as wildfire explosions, and other landmark moments from throughout the series, such as Ned Stark's beheading, the Red Wedding, and Bran falling from the Broken Tower in the series premiere. In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails. The show's version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion, with David Rintoul playing the role of the Mad King.|$|E

500|$|... "New York" [...] was {{met with}} mixed reviews by many critics. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "We didn't {{actually}} expect the New Directions to win nationals, but the episode just {{felt like it was}} going through the motions rather than seizing the opportunity to do something truly spectacular." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a [...] "good piece of television", and gave it a [...] "B+". He said it [...] "wasn't as good" [...] as the first-season finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", [...] "largely because it wasted <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a lot of that episode's set pieces without finding anything remotely as powerful as the performance of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of IGN gave [...] "New York" [...] a [...] "good" [...] grade of 7.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been, 'New York' was a decent close to an enjoyable season." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown said the episode was [...] "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a few killer numbers, strange resolutions, and head-scratching plot devices", while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was [...] "no exception" [...] to Glee having [...] "been undeniably frustrating in season two", though [...] "there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy".|$|E

We're not going to spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> that, {{but there will be}} some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the essay, Carr says that his recent {{difficulties}} with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to spending <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the Internet. He posits that regular Internet usage may have the effect of diminishing the capacity for concentration and contemplation. He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 University College London study titled [...] "Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future" [...] which suggests the emergence of new types of reading. He cites Maryanne Wolf, an expert on reading, for her expertise on the role of media and technology in learning written languages. Carr raises the point that unlike speech, which is an innate ability hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words. He acknowledges that his argument does not yet have the backing of long-term neurological and psychological studies. Carr further draws on Wolf's work, particularly her 2007 book Proust and the Squid, to relate his argument {{to the way in which}} neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and alphabet-based scripts. Therefore, Carr purports that the neural circuitry shaped by regular Internet usage can also be expected to be different from that shaped by the reading of books and other page-based written material.|$|E
