50|$|Grönvik gård (en. The Mansion of Grönvik) is {{a mansion}} {{in the village}} of Grönvik, Korsholm {{municipality}} in Western Finland. The house is in Swedish mansion style. Its shell is made of logs and the facade of wooden deals, on top of birch bark. It remains on the same location as where it was built. The year of construction and first owner of the mansion are not known, though it is assumed that it was built around 1780, for an <b>associate</b> <b>judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> in Vaasa, Johan Casimir de la Chapelle. However, it might have built by master builder Johan Johansson Kallinen (Kallis), who was registered in Iskmo 1791-1802 (although he probably stayed there still in 1804-1805). Both of them owned land of the hide on which the mansion lies. The original appearance of the house is unknown too, however, it is thought that the house was originally in one floor, with the current second story possibly added in 1812.|$|E
