50|$|The theatre was {{designed}} by architect John Eberson {{with the concept of}} creating the impression of a garden in old Andalusia. Its entire design, including that of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> was that of a Spanish garden or courtyard. The Orpheum Wichita {{was an integral part of}} the famous Orpheum Circuit and in its heyday virtually every major star of vaudeville graced its stage, including such luminaries as Eddie Cantor and Fannie Brice.|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} {{work on the}} Riverside Studio, Goff invited Hrdy {{to collaborate}} on a project he had been awarded to redesign the interior of Tulsa's Brady Theater, (then known as Convention Hall). Hrdy created a 50 foot m long <b>asbestos</b> <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> for the stage and a mural for the entrance. According to the biography by Wall, these two works, [...] "...solidified Hrdy's understanding of abstraction and her position as a modern artist." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{permanently}} installed <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> line set, though not used for productions, {{is a typical}} element of a theatrical rigging system installation. Building and fire codes typically require that either a <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> or water deluge system be installed to separate an audience from the stage {{in the event of}} a fire.|$|R
40|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> is use where, {{if there}} is a fire, it is {{necessary}} to create a temporary barrier within an opening, which seals off the area on <b>fire.</b> The <b>curtain</b> descends and prevents any fire and smoke from spreading from one area to another. It also allows people access to protected escape routes without any loss of fire resistance. The paper aims to presents the results of analysis of the scientific literature on the subject of <b>fire</b> <b>curtains...</b>|$|R

5000|$|At about 3:15 that afternoon, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the second act, eight men and eight women were performing In the Pale Moonlight. Sparks from an arc light ignited a muslin curtain, probably {{as a result of an}} electrical short circuit. A stagehand tried to douse the fire with the Kilfyre canisters provided, but it quickly spread to the fly gallery high above the stage. There, several thousand square feet of highly flammable painted canvas scenery flats were hung. The stage manager tried to lower the <b>asbestos</b> <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> but it snagged. Early reports state that it was stopped by the trolley-wire that carried one of the acrobats over the stage, but later investigation showed that the curtain had been blocked by a light reflector which stuck out under the proscenium arch. A chemist who later tested part of the curtain stated that it was mainly wood pulp mixed with asbestos, and would have been [...] "of no value in a fire".|$|E
50|$|In smaller theatres, {{a safety}} curtain {{is not usually}} required. Specifically, most United States {{building}} codes only require a <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in theatres with a stage height of more than 50 ft. The heavy, flame-retardant house tabs can provide some degree of fire separation.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{because of}} his early Chicago based background, Guérin was a {{frequent}} collaborator with the Chicago architectural firm (and the successor firm to Daniel Burnham’s practice) Graham, Anderson, Probst & White. Most notable of these commissions was the dramatic <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> for the theatre in GAPW's Chicago Civic Opera Building in 1929.|$|R
50|$|During {{construction}} of the theatre, some acoustic tests were carried out with the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in place while technical work was carried out on stage, but great consideration was given to balance between pit and stage. If the orchestra is small or absent, the pit can be covered and additional seats {{can be added to}} the auditorium.|$|R
50|$|HKU Station {{features}} designated refuge areas, {{to which}} passengers can be evacuated {{in case of}} emergency. Refuge areas are pressurised and equipped with fire systems including sprinklers and <b>fire</b> <b>curtains,</b> and independent power supply units. The HKU station is the first station in the MTR network to apply such shelter design {{and the use of}} lifts to reach safety.|$|R
25|$|The {{community}} theatre organization quickly {{grew and}} in May 1924, {{the citizens of}} Pasadena raised funds {{to build a new}} theatre in the city center at 39 South El Molino Avenue. Completed in 1925, the theatre was designed in a Spanish Colonial Revival style by Pasadena artist and architect Elmer Grey, with a <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> painted by Pasadena artist Alson S.

50|$|The Syndicate {{pushed the}} {{envelope}} {{of production and}} construction of new theaters along the nation's east coast during the early 1900s. In 1903, they expedited {{the construction of the}} Iroquois Theater, which some believe to be the reason for the ensuing <b>asbestos</b> <b>fire,</b> which killed 600 attendees, most of them women and children. After the incident, the Syndicate was under heavy legal examination, an issue they resolved unofficially through political donations and indictments of many of the workers at the venue rather than the managers themselves.|$|R
50|$|A safety <b>curtain</b> (or <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in America) is a {{fire safety}} {{precaution}} used in large proscenium theatres. It {{is usually a}} heavy fibreglass or iron curtain located immediately behind the proscenium arch. Asbestos-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were widely publicized. The safety curtain is {{sometimes referred to as}} an iron in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material.|$|R
5|$|In 1902 {{the theatre}} closed {{for nine months}} to enable {{extensive}} building work {{to be carried out}} in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.|$|R
50|$|Otto Strack {{employed}} many {{technological innovations}} when designing the theater, {{including one of}} the country's first <b>fire</b> <b>curtains,</b> all-electrical illumination, and a very early air conditioning system which employed fans and large amounts of ice. The theater also contained an electric organ, an innovation at that time. The theater is believed the first to employ a counterweight system for hoisting scenery, which was installed after World War I and remains in use today.|$|R

Fife's mother demanded that one of the building's five interior art panels, the one that featured cherubs, be painted over to cover their nakedness.|$|R
2500|$|... {{non-flammable}} fire curtains; other {{openings in}} the proscenium wall required self-closing fire-resistant doors. Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required {{to be in the}} theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible.|$|R
50|$|Here, Pedrick {{suggests}} that <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> could be secured at the roof {{level of a}} high-rise building. When released, they would envelope substantially the entire building. The curtains could be provided with apertures which when the curtain is released are located opposite rooms in the building, these rooms being designated as ones in which the occupants should congregate {{in the event of}} fire. The concern however was that such large curtains would have prevented escape from the building as well as increase the risk of suffocation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to landscape paintings, Alson Clark painted murals for the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, and the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> of the Pasadena Playhouse, depicting a Spanish galleon in full sail. A group of murals completed in 1929 {{can still be}} seen at the former 1st Trust & Savings Bank at 587 East Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California. The murals consist of four panels standing approximately ten feet in height, each depicting a major southern California industry: oil drilling, citrus farming, the movies, and shipping.|$|R

60|$|As we drew nearer, {{clouds of}} dust arose like lazy smoke from {{smoldering}} <b>fires,</b> <b>curtains</b> which concealed some mighty bull tossing the powdery earth with giant hoof. The cows seeing our approach, began to shift and change. The bulls did not hurry, on the contrary, they fell to the rear and grimly halted our advance. Towers of alkali dust, hot and white, lingering smoke-like in the air shielded us like a screen, and so--slowly riding--we drew near enough to perceive the calves and hear the mutter of the cows as they reënacted for us {{the life of the}} vanished millions of their kind.|$|R
50|$|Fire dampers are fitted where {{ductwork}} {{passes through}} fire compartment walls / <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> {{as part of}} a fire control strategy.

50|$|In {{the event}} of a fire, the use of smoke doors and <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> means that the stage area {{effectively}} functions as a chimney. The heated air rises and leaves through the smoke doors, and this puts the building into negative pressure, which in turn draws fresh air in through any open exit doors. Patrons waiting to exit will have fresh breathing air until the exit doors close. The exit doors which open out will be drawn closed tightly by this draft once they are no longer held open by evacuees. Once the doors are closed, the fire loses its oxygen source. If the doors are then opened again, a backdraft can occur.|$|R
