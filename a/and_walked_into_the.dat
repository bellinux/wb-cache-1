5|$|On June 28, 2008, a 17-year-old South Carolina {{teenager}} was decapitated {{after being}} struck by the Batman roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia. The teen, who was {{on a trip to}} the park with his church's youth group, scaled two fences with a friend into a restricted area <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ride's path. Although witnesses stated he was trying to retrieve his hat, a Cobb County police spokesman reported the teens were attempting to take a shortcut into the park.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

25|$|Unbeknownst to Kryuchkov and the KGB, while {{cataloging}} the documents, Mitrokin secretly {{took his}} own copies and immensely detailed notes of the documents which he smuggled to his dacha and hid under the floorboards. Mitrokhin {{made no attempt to}} contact any Western intelligence service during the Soviet Era. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (in 1992) he traveled to Latvia with copies of material from the archive <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American embassy in Riga. Central Intelligence Agency officers there did not consider him to be credible, concluding that the copied documents could be faked. He then went to the British embassy and a young diplomat there saw his potential and after a further appointment one month later with representatives of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) operations followed to retrieve the 25,000 pages of files hidden in his house, covering operations from {{as far back as the}} 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Between 1985 and 1986 the CIA lost every spy {{it had in}} Eastern Europe. The {{details of}} the {{investigation}} into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success, and has been widely criticized. In June 1987, Major Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, the chief of Cuban Intelligence in Czechoslovakia drove into Vienna, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American Embassy to defect. He revealed that every single Cuban spy on the CIA payroll was a double agent, pretending to work for the CIA, but secretly still being loyal to Castro. On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled Aldrich Ames out of his Jaguar. In the investigation that ensued, the CIA discovered that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents. On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected {{at the time that the}} sources were compromised, but the information was sent up the chain as genuine.|$|E
500|$|Joseph P. Kennedy {{had been}} a patron of Le Pavillon, but after Decré and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy {{switched}} his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. [...] It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained René Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F. Kennedy was elected president the year after opening. Verdon spent some weeks working with Fessaquet on the Kennedy family's favorite dishes. President Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce. [...] He often requested them as [...] "take out" [...] orders and would have them heated up on the plane as he traveled. Decré and Meyzen renamed the dish on their menu; Poularde Maison Blanch then became [...] "White House Chicken". In 1964, the Kennedys held a family reunion at La Caravelle; one of the subjects of discussion at the reunion {{was said to be}} whether Robert F. Kennedy should ask to be nominated as vice president at the upcoming 1964 Democratic National Convention. Joseph P. Kennedy was in attendance <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> restaurant {{with the aid of a}} cane.|$|E

2500|$|At the October 1992 Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Tebbit embarrassed John Major's {{government}} {{when he made}} {{a speech}} attacking the Treaty. As he walked up onto the podium he was applauded by some sections of the audience, described as [...] "young, in t-shirts, aggressively self-confident – the lager louts of our party" [...] in the diary of the Conservative Party chairman of the time, Norman Fowler. Tebbit held aloft {{a copy of the}} Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to see a single currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience shouted back [...] "No!" [...] after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers.

2500|$|At this point, the Confederate hold on Fort Fisher was untenable. The seaward {{batteries}} {{had been}} silenced, {{almost all of}} the north wall had been captured, and Ames had fortified a bastion within the interior. Terry, however, had concluded to finish the battle that night. Ames, ordered to maintain the offensive, organized a flanking maneuver, sending some of his men to advance outside the land wall, and come up behind the Confederate defenders of the last traverse. Within a few minutes the Confederate defeat was unmistakable. Colquitt and his staff rushed back to their rowboats just moments before Abbott's men seized the wharf. Major Reilly held up a white flag <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Union lines to announce the fort would surrender. Just before 10:00 p.m. [...] Terry rode to Battery Buchanan to receive the official surrender of the fort from Whiting.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-three {{members of}} the State Council arrived in due time but Nicholas delayed the {{announcement}} for hours, waiting for Michael. Soon after midnight, {{in the very beginning}} of , Nicholas realized that no more delays were possible, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Council hall alone. He [...] "seated himself in the place of the President" [...] and read his accession manifest. This, according to Korff, was the first ever precedent when the State Council convened at night. Nicholas went at lengths in explaining how the legal uncertainty set by Alexander lured him into pledging allegiance to Constantine. He specifically required [...] "that the time of Our accession to the Throne be counted from the 19th day of November 1825", the day of Alexander's death, sealing the fact that Constantine had never reigned and that the oath to Constantine was merely a misunderstanding rectified by Nicholas. The State Council accepted the fact without further discussion and was dismissed at about 1 a.m.|$|E

[...] When the committee submitted its toothless report, the CIA had 25 recruits entering its two-year training program, the smallest class of recruits ever. [...] As it had for most of its existence, the CIA suffered from poor management, poor morale, and a lack of employees familiar with the people they were spying on.|$|E
