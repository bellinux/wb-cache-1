5|$|Afternoon is <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> sun is {{descending}} {{from its}} daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly {{the center of}} the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E

5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor.

From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League.

Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.|$|E
