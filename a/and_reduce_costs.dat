Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center.

5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, Comentiolus, {{commanded}} a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, removing {{a major threat to}} Heraclius' reign. Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his grip on power.|$|E

5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b> Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E
5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E
5|$|The site is {{only able}} to {{communicate}} with LEO satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can communicate in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected and communicate with the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of the}} TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> and risk.|$|E

25|$|Adoption of RFID in {{the medical}} {{industry}} has been widespread and very effective. Hospitals are among the first users to combine both active and passive RFID. Many successful deployments in the healthcare industry have been cited where active technology tracks high-value, or frequently moved items, where passive technology tracks smaller, lower cost items that only need room-level identification. For example, medical facility rooms can collect data from transmissions of RFID badges worn by patients and employees, {{as well as from}} tags assigned to facility assets, such as mobile medical devices. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced plans to deploy RFID in hospitals across America to improve care <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

500|$|Neptune was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} preceding [...] with additional armour and the armament rearranged for greater efficiency. She was the first British dreadnought that differed in her gun turret layout from Dreadnought. Unlike the earlier ships, her wing turrets were staggered [...] "en echelon" [...] so that all five turrets could shoot on the broadside, although in practice the blast damage to the superstructure and boats made this impractical except in an emergency. This was done to match the 10-gun broadside of the latest foreign designs like the American , although the all-centreline turret configuration of the American ships eliminated the blast problems that compromised {{the effectiveness of the}} [...] "en echelon" [...] arrangement. Neptune was also the first British dreadnought to be equipped with superfiring turrets, in an effort to shorten the ship <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b> A further saving in length was achieved by siting the ship's boats on girders over the two wing turrets to reduce the length of the vessel. The drawback to this arrangement, however, was that if the girders were damaged during combat, they could fall onto the turrets, immobilising them. The bridge was also situated above the conning tower, which similarly risked being obscured if the bridge collapsed.|$|E
