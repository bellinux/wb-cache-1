5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E
5|$|Cyclonic Storm Komen was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal. The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July26 over the Ganges delta <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 2010, a Brendan Casey (also {{known as}} scient) {{released}} an unofficial patch, which fixes bugs in Alpha Centauri.

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the {{tropical}} cyclone managed to maintain winds of 50mph (85km/h) for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend. While the steering currents weakened on May25, Aletta slowed <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a large clockwise loop until May28. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May29 roughly 180mi (290km/h) southwest of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

She claimed silver, {{alongside}} Andrea Henkel, Arnd Peiffer and Michael Greis, {{in the opening}} mixed relay. On 5 March 2011, Neuner won the sprint race courtesy of a clean shooting performance.

The following day she also claimed gold in the women's relay, together with Andrea Henkel, Miriam Gössner and Tina Bachmann. Running the last leg for Germany, Neuner started in fourth, 67.5seconds off the lead, but she pulled back the entire time <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> front on the last lap. Her five medals made her the most successful female athlete in the history of Biathlon World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E
5|$|Farsari {{expanded}} his business interests into commercial photography and taught himself photography in 1883. In 1885 he formed {{a partnership with}} photographer Tamamura Kozaburō to acquire the Stillfried & Andersen studio (also known as the Japan Photographic Association), which had some 15 Japanese employees. The studio's stock included images by Felice Beato that it had acquired along with Beato's studio in 1877. It {{is not clear how}} long the partnership of Tamamura and Farsari lasted, for within a few years they were in competition with each other. Farsari further {{expanded his}} business in 1885 when the Yokohama Photographic Company (owned by David Welsh) folded and Farsari acquired its premises (next door to his own) <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in.</b> In addition to his Yokohama studio, Farsari likely had agents in Kobe and Nagasaki. By the end of 1886, Farsari and Chinese photographer Tong Cheong were the only foreign commercial photographers still operating in Japan, and by the following year even Tong Cheong had gone.|$|E

A group of students marching towards the chief minister Khawaja Nazimuddin's house was {{stopped in front of}} the Dhaka High Court. The rally changed its direction <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including A. K.

Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, {{complained to the}} Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a Company official and had been collecting hut tax {{for at least two}} years under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the late 1910s to Broken Hill.

5|$|The 19th Reconnaissance Group met the German attack {{divided into}} three groups, each {{composed}} of a Carrier troop, a troop of the Group's Light Company, and three motorcycles with sidecars. Unable to resist the German attack, after a brief struggle, in which they reported two enemy tanks destroyed, the Greek forces defending Akritas retreated to the heights south of the village. The Germans left a few tanks in the village <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> two columns to capture the village of Megali Sterna {{on the one hand}} and the Kalindria railway station and the village of Cherso on the other. Through their capture of Akritas and the heights to its north, the Germans scored a significant success, opening the path to attacking the Krousia position form the rear. As a result, the surviving forces of the 193rd Regiment and the 19th Reconnaissance Group became de facto encircled and cut off by the two fast-moving German columns, as were the companies of the 9th Border Sector on the division's extreme left. Lacking any heavy weapons, these units had no choice but remain in place and await the arrival of the 192nd Regiment.|$|E
