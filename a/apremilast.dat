25|$|In the {{synthesis}} of <b>apremilast,</b> compound 3 in scheme 5 is produced in a 41% yield from compound 2 treated with lithium hexamethyldisilazide, in mixture with lithium dimethylsulfone and boron trifluoride etherate. The resolution of compound 3 was accomplished by treating it with N-acetyl-L-leucine yielding 3S. The final step then uses condensation of 3-N-acetylaminophthalic anhydride with 3S to afford <b>apremilast</b> (1S) in 75% yield.|$|E
25|$|After {{finding a}} novel set of analogs of thalidomide, namely 3-(1,3-dioxo-1,3 dihydroisoindol-2-yl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) propionic acid (not shown), which had PDE4 {{inhibition}} activity the work began {{to optimize the}} activity. For that purpose the researchers used a known structure moiety, 3,4-dialkoxyphenyl, that is a recognized pharmacophore in PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram (Figure 6) and roflumilast and added it onto {{the structure of the}} previously mentioned analog series. After tweaking the structure and testing different substitution at the 4-position of the phthaloyl ring and at the carboxyl acid the researchers finally landed at a molecule that potently inhibits PDE4 and TNF-α, which they later named <b>apremilast</b> (Figure 4). The S-enantiomer of <b>apremilast</b> was chosen since it was the more active enantiomer. Since the structure of <b>apremilast</b> lacks the acidic chiral hydrogen it should not racemize in vivo, unlike thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide.|$|E
25|$|Described {{below are}} schemes for synthesizing thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide and <b>apremilast,</b> as {{reported}} from prominent primary literature.

25|$|In 1998 {{thalidomide}} {{was approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) under strict regulations.

25|$|Thalidomide and its analogs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are {{believed}} {{to act in a}} similar fashion even though their exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. It is believed that they work through different mechanisms in various diseases. The net effect is probably due to different mechanisms combined. <b>Apremilast</b> is, however, believed to work through a different mechanism and therefore will be discussed separately. Mechanism of action will be explained in light of today's knowledge, mainly in MM (Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide {{has led to the}} study and creation of thalidomide analogs. Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects— except for greater myelosuppression. In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA approved. Additionally, <b>apremilast</b> was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Apremilast</b> {{is a small}} {{molecule}} inhibitor of PDE4, {{an enzyme}} that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
