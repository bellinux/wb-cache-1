5|$|The <b>Accounting</b> Review was {{established}} in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would {{be of interest to}} <b>accounting</b> practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor.

5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, The <b>Accounting</b> Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended to have less practical <b>accounting</b> experience and more formal education.

5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that <b>accounting</b> ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} <b>accounting</b> ethics could be taught throughout <b>accounting</b> curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all <b>accounting</b> teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary <b>accounting</b> classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide new}} firm-level {{evidence}} {{on the effects of}} capital <b>account</b> liberalization. Based on corporate foreign-currency credit ratings data and a novel capital <b>account</b> restrictions index, we find that capital controls can substantially limit access to, and raise the cost of, foreign currency debt, especially for firms without foreign currency revenues. As an identification strategy, we exploit, via a difference-in-difference approach, within-country variation in firms'' access to foreign currency, measured by whether or not a firm belongs to the nontradables sector. Nontradables firms benefit substantially more from capital <b>account</b> liberalization than others, a finding that is robust to a broad range of alternative specifications.

40|$|The paper investigates {{cyclical}} {{fluctuations in the}} current and financial (formerly capital) <b>accounts</b> of the balance of payments and major underlying components for nine industrial countries. The empirical model uses as explanatory variables domestic output growth, price inflation, real exchange rate fluctuations, energy price inflation, global growth, and regional growth. The evidence from the estimation of the model indicates the importance of fluctuations in output growth to the cyclicality of the current and financial <b>account</b> balances. The necessary and sufficient condition to sustain a large current <b>account</b> deficit is high domestic growth, which tends to stimulate financial inflows and provides adequate resources for financing. Other factors appear to be less important to the cyclicality of the current and financial <b>account</b> balances and their negative correlations.
