The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> their performance on three core components of fiscal policy: government spending, taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{eleventh}} {{entry in the}} Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series and the successor to , a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.|$|E
5|$|During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries were {{approved}} by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990, {{but this was not}} immediately supported by the government. On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the proposed areas of the Triangle Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications from the Christian Democratic Party, stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.|$|E

During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside.

25|$|Several years later, a king named Sagara magically {{acquired}} sixty thousand sons. One day, King Sagara {{performed a}} ritual of worship {{for the good}} of the kingdom. One of the integral parts of the ritual was a horse, which was stolen by the jealous Indra. Sagara sent all his sons all over the earth to search for the horse. They found it in the nether-world (or Underworld) next to a meditating sage Kapil tied by Lord Indra(the king of Swarg). Believing that the sage had stolen the horse, they hurled insults at him and caused his penance to be disturbed. The sage opened his eyes for the first time in several years <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the sons of Sagara. With this glance, all sixty thousand were burnt to death.|$|E
25|$|Ögedei {{was also}} {{known to be}} a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable.

Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E

25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|The task {{of making}} a {{recommendation}} for a permanent solution for the national airline was given to a new Civil Aviation Board, which had Falck as a board member. They came with their recommendation on 28 November 1945, which favored a single, privately owned Norwegian flag carrier, with a broad ownership, who would receive a concession for the operation of all domestic and international routes. Following the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1945 on 8 October, the Labor Party received a majority, with 76 of 150 seats. Also the Norwegian Communist Party did its best election ever, receiving 11 seats. A proposition {{was made by the}} Ministry of Defense on 18 January 1946, and sent to parliament. It discussed several options, such as creating a government agency or a state-owned limited company, permitting several airlines to operate the different routes, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the possibility that the shipowners were purchasing DNL shares to hinder competition with their shipping lines. It concluded with a part private, part state-owned company was preferred, and that the state should purchase shares for NOK5 million. While the Labor Party at the time was in favor of nationalization, the proposition stated that this was a possibility to limit the state's spending of dearly needed capital.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss again, {{and chose}} to bat. Openers Marsh and Taylor again got the {{tourists}} {{off to a}} solid start, but their heroics of the fifth test {{were not to be}} repeated, as Marsh was caught by debutant Igglesden off Galdstone Small for 17, the opening stand worth 48. David Boon came to the wicket <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> ease, as he and Taylor set about building a solid second wicket partnership. The pair batted throughout the morning, and Taylor soon brought up his fifty. The young New South Welshman had been in majestic form throughout the series, and England had no answers for the well-timed left-hander. He pulled and drove with ease once again, to bring up his milestone. Boon likewise approached his half-century, but soon lost his partner Taylor, who rarely edged a ball outside off-stump of the bowling of Igglesden to be caught behind, and give the bowler his first ever test wicket. Taylor had gone for 71, and Australia were 130 for 2. Boon fell shortly after for 46, bringing Dean Jones to the wicket to partner his captain Allan Border. The pair seemed to enjoy each other's company, and once again built a solid 4th wicket partnership, batting throughout the remainder of the first day. Jones was in a hurry and scored freely, all around the wicket, working the field for quick singles and twos, and picking off the bad balls for four. Shortly before stumps he brought up his second century of the tour. At stumps on day one, Australia ended on 325 for 3, with Border not out on 66 and Jones on 114 not out.|$|E

The commission also investigated splitting Hereford & Worcester in 1990, following submissions by Hereford City Council and the [...] "Herefordshire Action Committee", although the proposals were rejected at that time. Boundary changes between Hereford & Worcester and Warwickshire at Mappleborough Green, Pebworth, Long Marston and Studley were also proposed, and some were accepted resulting in minor changes to both counties. In 1993 there were more minor adjustments of the county boundary, this time between Bromsgrove and Dudley Metropolitan Borough near to Wollescote and Solihull Metropolitan Borough near Hockley Heath.|$|E

In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice.
