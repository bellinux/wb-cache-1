5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> bombing losses. In {{spite of these}} losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} about how people attempt to see the future through various superstitious means.

5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Daksinakaali, also spelled Dakshinakaali, is {{the most}} popular form of Kaali in Bengal. There are various {{versions}} for the origin of the name Dakshinakaali. Dakshina refers to the gift given to a priest before performing a ritual or to one's guru. Such gifts are traditionally given with the right hand. Daksinakaali's two right hands are usually depicted in gestures of blessing and giving of boons. One version of the origin of her name comes from the story of Yama, lord of death, who lives in the south (daksina). When Yama heard Kali's name, he fled in terror, and so those who worship Kali are said to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> death itself.|$|E

In 1954, Holloman's last professional season, he spent time on five different minor league squads, including former stops Toronto and Augusta, before retiring. The retirement was partially due to a sore arm, the result of pitching too frequently while playing winter ball. After retiring, Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency, {{and served as a}} scout for the Baltimore Orioles. He also turned to drinking for many years, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> the addiction. He died on May 1, 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens, Georgia of a heart attack.|$|E

The Allies believed that the division would face only minimal opposition and would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto was outside the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.|$|E

WDSM-TV (now KBJR-TV) became an NBC-TV affiliate, which contributed to WEBC's 1955 switch to Top 40 programming.|$|R

5|$|The online mode of the game, {{which is}} only {{available}} in the Japanese version, also introduces {{a group called the}} Restrictors, the former leaders of Deepground before Weiss took over.

However, Weiss was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> this control method, and the Tsviets wrenched control from the Restrictors.

50|$|The {{expansion}} into the Ararat plain was briefly interrupted by minor clashes with the Assyrians at the south-western frontier of Urartu.

After four years of warfare, Argishti was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> occupy the Ararat plain, and by 776 BC was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> found a town {{in the middle of}} the valley.

By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|Umar al-Aqta was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> {{the initial}} Byzantine {{resistance}} against his invasion and reach {{the shores of}} the Black Sea.

The subsequent battle ended in a complete Byzantine victory and the death of the Emir on the field, and was followed by a successful Byzantine counteroffensive across the border. The Byzantine victories proved decisive: the main threats to the Byzantine borderlands were eliminated, and the era of Byzantine ascendancy in the East, which would culminate in the great conquests of the 10th century, had begun.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the main German units retreated through Lyon.

The next day, Lyon was liberated and 2,000 Germans were captured, but the rest had already continued their retreat north. Lyon celebrated for two days with the Americans. The Allies made a last-ditch attempt to cut off the Germans with an offensive towards Bourg-en-Bresse by the 45thDivision and the 117thCavalry Squadron from the original Taskforce Butler. However, the 45thDivision was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> the German defenses near the town. The 117thCavalry Squadron had more success, bypassing Bourg-en-Bresse and taking Montreval and Marboz north of Bourg-en-Bresse instead. By 3September Montreval was secure, but the squadron soon found itself trapped by units from the 11thPanzer Division, which surrounded the town. As a result, the squadron was almost annihilated, and the German escape route was again open. The American units then retired to Marboz.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
