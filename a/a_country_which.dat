5|$|The unique {{condition}} of Argentina, as <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> had achieved advanced {{development in the}} early 20th century but experienced a reversal, has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline. The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets {{is said to have}} remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Formerly an {{administrative}} district {{in its own}} right, even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23villages in the rural community of Diembéring, of which Kabrousse, Cap Skirring, and Boucott-Diembéring are the largest centres. This rural community {{is located in the}} Kabrousse Arrondissement. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the Minister of the Interior. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village.|$|E
25|$|From {{the seventh}} century A.D. onwards, many popular {{religious}} elements of heterogeneous nature were incorporated into Mahayana Buddhism which finally resulted in the origin of Vajrayana, Kalachakrayana and Sahajayana Tantric Buddhism. Tantric Buddhism first developed in Uddiyana, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> was divided into two kingdoms, Sambhala and Lankapuri. Sambhala has been identified with Sambalpur and Lankapuri with Subarnapura (Sonepur).|$|E

25|$|The Russia–Belarus energy dispute {{began when}} Russian {{state-owned}} gas supplier Gazprom demanded {{an increase in}} gas prices paid by Belarus, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> has been closely allied with Moscow and forms a loose union state with Russia. It escalated on 8 January 2007, when the Russian state-owned pipeline company Transneft stopped pumping oil into the Druzhba pipeline which runs through Belarus because Belarus was siphoning the oil off the pipe without mutual agreement.|$|E
25|$|One {{circumstance}} {{which may}} call for issuance {{of a second}} passport of a particular type is a prolonged visa-processing delay. Another is safety or security, such as travel between Israel and <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> refuses to grant entry to {{a person with a}} passport which indicates travel to Israel. The period of validity of a second passport issued under either circumstance is generally 4 years from the date of issue.|$|E
25|$|The issuing {{authority}} may also require applicants to attest {{that they have}} had no criminal convictions, or that they do not partake in certain activities (like prostitution or drug trafficking). Some countries will deny visas if the travelers' passports show evidence of citizenship of, or travel to, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> is considered hostile by that country. For example, some Arabic-oriented countries will not issue visas to nationals of Israel and those whose passports bear evidence of visiting Israel.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} remittances from Peruvians abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Toledo sought to strengthen the link between Peruvian migrants and their homeland {{through the creation of}} advisory councils. The issue is especially important for <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> experienced a massive emigration of professionals under Fujimori and which still has 10% of its population living abroad. The councils were also part of an effort by the first Minister of Foreign Affairs, García Sayan, to professionalize the foreign service.|$|E
25|$|Aspects of {{propaganda}} {{can be traced}} back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government. China in the era of Mao Zedong is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimize the state and the policies of leaders. The CPC successfully made use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> had a largely rural and illiterate population.|$|E

The approximate nature of the timezone can be shown with China, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> used to span five time zones and now uses only one (UTC +8).|$|E

25|$|On February 19, 2009 the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., {{announced}} that Queen Elizabeth II would name John Warner an honorary Knight Commander {{for his work}} strengthening the American-British military alliance. As {{a person who is}} not a British citizen (or a citizen of <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> acknowledges the British monarch as their own monarch), the title of Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire only allows Warner to put the Post-nominal letters KBE after his name.|$|E
25|$|In the lead-up to World War II in 1939, King affirmed Canadian {{autonomy}} {{by saying}} that the Canadian Parliament would make the final decision on the issue of going to war. He reassured the pro-British Canadians that Parliament would surely decide that Canada would be at Britain's side if Great Britain was drawn into a major war. At the same time, he reassured those who were suspicious of British influence in Canada by promising that Canada would not participate in British colonial wars. His Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, promised French-Canadians that the government would not introduce conscription; individual participation would be voluntary. In 1939, in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> had seemed deeply divided, these promises made it possible for Parliament to agree almost unanimously to declare war.|$|E
25|$|Albania was {{the first}} state to have {{declared}} itself officially fully atheist. In some other communist states such as Romania, the Orthodox Church as an organisation enjoyed relative freedom and even prospered, albeit under strict secret police control. That, however, did not rule out demolishing churches and monasteries as part of broader systematization (urban planning), state persecution of individual believers, and Romania stands out as <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> ran a specialised institution where many Orthodox (along with peoples of other faiths) were subjected to psychological punishment or torture and mind control experimentation in order to force them give up their religious convictions (see Piteşti prison). However, this was only supported by one faction within the regime, and lasted only three years. The Communist authorities closed down the prison in 1952, and punished many of those responsible for abuses (twenty of them were sentenced to death).|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Israel and West Germany {{signed an}} {{agreement}} stipulating that West Germany was to pay Israel for the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust, and compensate for Jewish property stolen by the Nazis. Over the next 14 years, West Germany paid Israel 3 billion marks (equivalent to USD$111.5bn in modern currency). The reparations became a decisive part of Israel's income, comprising as high as 87.5% of Israel's income in 1956. In 1950, the Israeli government launched Israel Bonds for American and Canadian Jews to buy. In 1951, the final results of the bonds program exceeded $52 million. Additionally, many American Jews made private donations to Israel, which in 1956 were thought to amount to $100 million a year. In 1957, bond sales amounted to 35% of Israel's special development budget. Later in the century Israel became significantly reliant on economic aid from the United States, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> also became Israel's most important source of political support internationally.|$|E
25|$|For all this, {{the subject}} of the South American Congress held in 1958 in Rio de Janeiro was not unknown to board members: Raúl Colombo and Eduardo Palma of Argentina, Fermín Sorhueta, Washington Cataldi, Luis Tróccoli and Juan Carlos Bracco of Uruguay, doctor Alfredo Gallindo of Bolivia, Lydio Quevedo of Paraguay, Teófilo Salinas of Perú, Alberto Goñi of Chile, and Joao Havelange and Abilio D'Almeida of Brazil. The {{secretary}} general of the Union des Associations Européennes de Football, or UEFA, Henry Delaunay, submitted a proposal to the then-head of CONMEBOL José Ramos de Freitas of Brazil to organize an annual double confrontation between the champions of Europe and South America in what was seen as a welcomed but unneeded incentive. The proposal {{for the creation of a}} South American club championship was supported by Argentina and Brazil but was opposed by Uruguay, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> at that time still had a transcendent pre-eminence in the decision-making of the confederation, sharing political and continental power with Argentina. Brazil had just won their first World Cup and had not yet the privileges or political weight that presently holds.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 1714 (O.S.) Queen Anne of Great Britain died. Despite Jacobite machinations, the Act of Settlement ensured {{a smooth}} Protestant {{succession}} and the Elector of Hanover ascended the throne as George I of Great Britain and Ireland. The first warrant signed by George reinstated Marlborough as Captain-General of the army, and from London the Duke helped organise {{the defeat of}} the Jacobite rising of 1715. However, the new King and the Whigs in general never forgave those Tories accused of abandoning the Grand Alliance and the part they played in concluding the Peace of Utrecht. Rather than face impeachment Bolingbroke fled to France in April 1715 (N.S) to join the Pretender, as did Ormonde who followed in August. Oxford remained in England and was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two years, never again to hold office. The Tory party, leaderless and riven by faction, did not survive intact, and their decline {{paved the way for the}} eventual rise of Robert Walpole and decades of Whig domination in early Georgian Britain – <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> emerged from the war as a world power, and one which had learnt to utilise its financial muscle to harness European allies for its own strategic interests.|$|E

25|$|Although {{numerous}} naval battles {{took place}} before the 12th century, such as the large-scale Three Kingdoms Battle of Chibi in the year 208, {{it was during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD) that the Chinese established a permanent, standing navy in 1132 AD. At its height by the late 12th century there were 20 squadrons of some 52,000 marines, with the admiral's headquarters at Dinghai, while the main base remained closer to modern Shanghai in those days. The establishment of the permanent navy during the Song period came out of the need to defend against the Jurchens, who had overrun the northern half of China, and to escort merchant fleets entering the South East Pacific and Indian Ocean on long trade missions abroad to the Hindu, Islamic, and East African spheres of the world. However, considering China was <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>which</b> was longtime menaced by land-based nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu, Göktürks, Mongols and so on, the navy was always seen as an adjunct rather than an important military force. By the 1516th centuries China's canal system and internal economy were sufficiently developed to nullify the need for the Pacific fleet, which was scuttled when conservative Confucianists gained power in the court and began a policy of introspection. After the First and Second Opium Wars, which shook up the generals of the Qing dynasty, the government attached greater importance to the navy.|$|E
