40|$|Fraud and {{corruption}} cost South Africa billions of rand yearly. Institutions {{of higher learning}} are no less vulnerable to fraud {{and corruption}} than other organisations, but are also subject to risks that are unique to academia. The Public Finance Management Act. No. 1 of 1999 requires Public entities including the councils (university or college controlling body) of public {{institutions of higher learning}} to adopt enterprise risk management, which includes a fraud and corruption risk management policy and procedures. The function of the fraud and corruption policy is to provide an objective strategy to prevent, detect and investigate any possible irregularity in order to prevent further loss in line with Corporate Governance requirements. The <b>anti-fraud</b> and corruption <b>strategy</b> measures include setting the appropriate tone by management of the institution, being proactive (fraud risk assessments), and being reactive (reporting process, investigation and taking appropriate action). The actions include disciplinary action and criminal or civil proceedings in order to recover assets lost. The procedures address the implementation of the policy. This research focused on identifying the relevant issues that could be included in the formulation of fraud and corruption risk management policies and procedures for institutions of higher learning. The research was conducted using a qualitative methodology consisting of a document analysis and interviews. It was found that, out of eleven institutions of higher learning investigated only one institution meets the criteria set out in the framework developed in the research as an assessment tool.

40|$|This study {{undertook}} a {{critical analysis of}} the role of public participation in local governance and service delivery, with specific reference to the Buffalo City Municipality. The main aims of the study were to identify possible deficiencies in public participation processes, the development of strategies to enhance public participation, the development of mechanisms to ensure coordinated, integrated and focused public participation initiatives {{and the development of a}} normative model for improved public participation. The triangulation research methodology was employed with emphasis on the quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The sample comprised of councillors, officials and ward committee members. Questionnaires, with open and closed questions, were employed for the councillors and focus group interviews were conducted with ward committee members. Statistical procedures were utilised to interpret and analyse the quantitative data to determine the results using the Statistica package for data analysis. The qualitative data analysis involved thematic content analysis. Findings suggest that the current public participation strategies are inadequate. The correlation of results further reveals that a significant negative relationship exists between the councillors, officials and ward committee members. Despite various legislative prescriptions pertaining to public participation requirements in local government, the results imply that the Buffalo City Municipality has not fully complied with such prescriptions and national policy directives. The thesis proposes specific recommendations on how the Buffalo City Municipality can address the current short comings in terms of its public participation programmes and strategies. Recommendations include the establishment of a centralised Public Participation Unit, the empowerment of ward committee members and ward councillors, adequate resource allocation for ward committees, enhanced coordination between the various community structures, improved interaction with local communities, enhanced public participation initiatives and the need for additional <b>anti-fraud</b> and anti-corruption <b>strategies</b> within the municipality. A normative model, for enhanced public participation in local government, is also proposed in the thesis...|$|R

40|$|Fraud in the EU, {{comparison}} analysis {{between the}} structures and responsibility relationships of the OLAF and a traditional corporate governance layout in private organizations in regards of fraud prevention and detection. Since the recent increase in fraud scandals, companies had to adapt themselves to more scrutiny from the shareholders {{and to the}} toughing of company law that was so far regulated by the theft act 1968 and disclosure through information. Hence in the UK, the Parliament launched in march 2005 the fraud bill. On the European level, this quest for transparency has been translated by {{the implementation of a}} European Anti fraud Office in 1999, the OLAF. The OLAF (or Office Europen de Lutte Anti-Fraude) has been charged by the European Union with protecting the interests of the European Union, to fighting fraud, corruption and any other irregular activity, including misconduct within the European Institutions, in an accountable, transparent and cost-effective manner. OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations. It also organizes close and regular co-operation between the competent authorities of the Member States in order to co-ordinate their activities. OLAF supplies Member States with the necessary support and technical know-how to help them in their anti-fraud activities. It contributes to the design of the <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>strategy</b> of the European Union and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation. This dissertation is analyzing the analogy {{of the structure of the}} OLAF with the traditional corporate governance. The question is here to evaluate the structure and responsibility relationships of the Olaf in comparison with the monitoring model based on corporate governance. The outcome of this comparison should give us an understanding of functioning of the Olaf and might give more insight of the issues/conflicts faced by this institution...|$|E
