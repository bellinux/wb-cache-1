25|$|On {{her fifth}} whaling voyage, Admiral Colpoys sailed to South Georgia via Santiago, Cape Verde. She was lost on 28 November 1817 when an iceberg floated {{into the bay}} {{in which she was}} {{anchored}} <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> onshore. Her crew was saved. The crew was able to save 700 barrels of elephant oil which was transhipped to England. However, 800 barrels of elephant oil were lost. Another account reports that the iceberg severed Admiral Colpoyss cable; attempts to break up the iceberg using cannon fire were unable to prevent Admiral Colpoys from drifting on to the rocks. Francis Todrig, in King George, retrieved the crew.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 1896 the Lamington, hauling {{fruit from}} Valencia, Spain to New York City ran aground 15 {{miles east of}} the Fire Island Lighthouse. Life saving crews from the Coast Guard Stations at Blue Point, Lone Hill and Bellport were able to rescue much of her crew from the wreck using {{breeches}} buoys on the first day. Salvage operations began almost immediately by men and tugs from the Merritt Wrecking Company, which likely kept her from breaking up during a storm that swept waves in over the deck <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> farther inland. At the first break in the storm the remaining crew, and one small Spanish pony, were rescued. After her cargo was removed, she was refloated on 26 February and towed to New York.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April 1800, Revolutionnaire and Dryad {{arrived in}} Milford Haven in a distressed state. Dryad {{had been on}} a cruise out of Cork and was on her way home when on 2 April, with her rigging much damaged by hurricanes, when she had {{encountered}} Revolutionnaire, which had lost her rudder. Dryad escorted Revolutionnaire to Cork, but when they were no more than an hour out of the port, the winds blew them towards Plymouth. On 16 April they were close to the rocks at Waterford when Dryad succeeded in getting a cable on to Revolutionnaire. Unfortunately, the cable broke and Dryad pulled away, expecting Revolutionnaire to wreck on the rocks. However, providentially, the wind shifted <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> away from shore. On 19 April both vessels succeeded in safely reaching Milford Haven.|$|E

25|$|Williams won {{her third}} Rogers Cup title in Toronto beating Sorana Cîrstea in the final. Williams reached {{the final of}} the Western & Southern Open for the first time but lost to Azarenka. At the 2013 US Open, Williams began as the top seed and {{defending}} champion. She reached the final—a rematch of the 2012 final against Azarenka—and won in three sets, capturing her 17th Grand Slam singles title. Williams became the oldest US Open champion in the Open Era <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> career prize money past $50 million. After the US Open, Williams headed to Beijing where she beat Jelena Janković to win the China Open for her 10th title of 2013. Williams went through the WTA championships undefeated winning the final against Li Na, to become the first person to defend the title since Justine Henin in 2007. Williams won her eleventh title of the year becoming the eighth player to win eleven tournaments or more in a year and the first since Martina Hingis in 1997. Additionally, Williams became the oldest person to win the WTA Championships and the fourth player to win the event four times or more. By winning the championship, Williams became the first woman to win more than ten million dollars in a season and with her total of $12,385,572, only Rafael Nadal, in 2013 and Novak Djokovic, in 2011, 2012 and 2013, have earned more money in a single season. Williams finished as the year end world No. 1 for the third time, becoming the oldest No. 1 player in WTA history. She was also named the 2013 ITF World Champion, the fourth time that she has been given the World Champion's crown. Williams received two prizes at the 2013 ESPY Awards. Williams won Best Female Athlete and Best Female Tennis Player. Williams is just the fourth person to win Best Female Athlete on two occasions and she won Best Female Tennis player for a record sixth time. In late December 2013, Williams capped off her year by receiving the Associated Press 2013 Female Athlete of the Year award, her third AP award after 2002 and 2009. Only two women, Chris Evert and Babe Didrikson, have been chosen more often as AP Athlete of the Year since the annual awards were first handed out in 1931.|$|E
500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent yourself at the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E
500|$|Aware of {{the efforts}} her mother made to give her life, support her and raise her, Millett became a care-giver and {{coordinator}} of many daily therapies, <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> mother to be active. She {{wanted to give her}} [...] "independence and dignity". In the article [...] "Her Mother, Herself", Pat Swift wrote: [...] "Helen Millett might have been content to go [...] "gently into that good night"—she was after all more afraid of the nursing home than dying—but daughter Kate was having none of that. Feminist warrior, human rights activists, gay liberationist, writer and artist, Kate Millett has not gone gently through life and never hesitates to rage at anyone—friend or foe, family or the system—to right a perceived wrong. When the dignity and quality of her ailing mother's life was at stake, this book's unfolding tale became inevitable." [...] Even though Helen played a role in having her daughter committed to the University of Minnesota's Mayo wing, Kate had her mother removed from the nursing home and returned to her apartment, where attendants managed her care. During this period, Millett could also [...] "bully" [...] her mother for her lack of cultural sophistication and the amount of television she watched and could be harsh with caregivers.|$|E

500|$|Canning reappeared {{at about}} 10pm on 29January 1753. [...] At {{the sight of}} her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. [...] Once {{recovered}} she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. [...] Elizabeth was described as being in a [...] "deplorable condition"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. [...] A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. [...] They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. [...] She awoke [...] "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" [...] and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would [...] "go their way" [...] (become a prostitute). [...] Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> upstairs into a loft. [...] There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. [...] The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. [...] Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. [...] She recalled hearing the name [...] "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. [...] On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of [...] "Mother" [...] Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly [...] distant.|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, Genie {{never used}} any {{automatic}} speech or interjections during conversations. Despite repeated efforts {{to teach her}} she could not start an interaction with automatic speech, and she only responded to ritual questions, such as [...] "How are you?", if someone repeatedly asked her <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> into doing so; [...] she then could say [...] "How are you?" [...] or [...] "I am fine", {{but it would be}} very forced. The only exception was when the person speaking to her had some additional affect, after which she usually laughed or tried to get the person to do it again. In addition, Genie never learned any profanity nor ever used other substitute swear words. These aspects of speech are typically either bilateral or originate in the right hemisphere, and split-brain and hemispherectomy patients normally learn them without difficulty, but linguists were unsurprised that Genie never used them. Curtiss wrote that Genie's failure to do so was because her childhood gave her no opportunity to observe conversation, where children typically learn them.|$|E
2500|$|From ages six to twelve, Nyiregyházi was {{observed}} by the psychologist Géza Révész {{and was the}} subject of an article and a book, published in 1911 and 1916, respectively. Nyiregyházi's father, Ignácz, was a singer in the Royal Opera Chorus in Budapest; he was also very encouraging and caring but died when Ervin was twelve. [...] Before Ignácz's death, he reported several extraordinary things about his son: that Ervin had tried to sing before he was one year old; that he reproduced tunes correctly before he was two; he began to compose at the age of two; and that he played almost every song he heard correctly on a mouth-organ {{by the time he reached}} age three; by the age of seven Ervin could identify any note or chord that was played for him. He was known for his musicality just as much as his technique. On tests of general intelligence, Ervin scored a few years above average, meaning he was prodigy, not a savant. [...] Ervin's mother, Mária, was a stage mother who tried (unsuccessfully) to dissuade him from studying opera and symphonic music <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> son to study the standard piano repertoire so he could concertize and make money for their family. [...] (In later years, the pianist would claim that his mother sexually molested him.) [...] Ervin eventually broke with his mother, and later expressed pleasure that she had perished in a Nazi concentration camp.|$|E
