5000|$|The {{theory of}} {{operation}} behind the <b>aperture</b> sight is often {{stated that the}} human eye will automatically center the front sight when looking through the rear <b>aperture,</b> thus ensuring accuracy. [...] However, <b>aperture</b> sights are accurate even if the front sight is not centered in the rear <b>aperture</b> due to a phenomenon called parallax suppression. [...] This is because, when the <b>aperture</b> is smaller than the eye's pupil diameter, the <b>aperture</b> itself becomes the entrance pupil for the entire optical system of target, front sight post, rear <b>aperture,</b> and eye. As long as the <b>aperture's</b> diameter is completely contained within the eye's pupil diameter, the exact visual location of the front sight post within the rear <b>aperture</b> ring {{does not affect the}} accuracy, and accuracy only starts to degrade slightly due to parallax shift as the <b>aperture's</b> diameter begins to encroach {{on the outside of the}} eye's pupil diameter. An additional benefit to <b>aperture</b> sights is that smaller <b>apertures</b> provide greater depth of field, making the target less blurry when focusing on the front sight.|$|R

Schmidt realized that by employing a large spherically shaped mirror (instead of the normal paraboloidal mirror of a reflector telescope) and a smaller <b>apertured</b> diaphragm placed {{at the center of}} curvature of the mirror, he could at a stroke eliminate coma and astigmatism.

40|$|Abstract—The {{shielding}} {{ability of}} a shielding cavity with an <b>aperture</b> will be greatly degraded at resonance frequencies, and the resonance modes and frequencies are affected by <b>aperture</b> resonances and aperture-cavity coupling, which are closely related with <b>aperture</b> sizes. The equivalent circuit method and numerical method of Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) are {{used to analyze the}} effects of <b>aperture</b> resonances and aperture-cavity coupling on the electromagnetic resonances of a cavity with an <b>aperture</b> in this paper. Both analytical and numerical results show that the resonance modes of a shielding cavity with an <b>aperture</b> consist of cavity resonance modes and <b>aperture</b> resonance modes, and the resonance frequencies will shift with the change of the <b>aperture</b> sizes because of the <b>aperture</b> resonances and aperture-cavity coupling. Variation rules of electromagnetic resonances with <b>aperture</b> sizes for a cavity with an <b>aperture</b> are given, which will be useful for design of shielding cavities.

50|$|The {{resolution}} of a PSTM instrument is {{highly dependent on}} probe tip geometry and diameter. Probes are typically fabricated via chemical etching of an optical fiber in a solution of HF and can be <b>apertured</b> or apertureless. Using chemical etching, fiber tips with a curvature radius as low as 20 nm have been made. In <b>apertured</b> tips, {{the sides of the}} sharpened fiber are sputter coated in a metal or other material. This helps to limit tunnelling of photons {{into the side of the}} probe in order to maintain more consistent and accurate evanescent field coupling. Due to the rigidity of the fiber probe, even brief contact with the surface will destroy the probe tip. Larger probe tips have a greater degree of coupling to the evanescent field and will therefore have greater collection efficiency due to a larger area of the optical fiber interacting with the field. The primary limitation of a large tip is the increased probability of collision with rougher surface features as well as photon tunnelling into the side of the probe. A narrower probe tip is necessary to resolve more abrupt surface features without collision, however the collection efficiency will be reduced. Figure 3 shows that fiber probe with metal coating. In metal coated fiber probes, the diameter and geometry of the aperture, or uncoated area at the tip of the probe, determines the collection efficiency. Wider cone angles result in larger aperture diameters and shorter probe lengths, while narrower cone angles result in smaller aperture diameters and longer probes. Double tapered probetips have been developed in which a long, narrow region of the probe tapers into a tip with a wider cone angle. This provides a wider aperture for greater collection efficiency while still maintaining a long narrow probe tip capable of resolving abrupt surface features with low risk of collision.|$|E

The degree of optical coupling to the probe tip as a function of height must therefore be determined individually for a given instrument and probe tip. In practice, this is usually determined during instrument calibration by scanning the probe perpendicular to the surface and monitoring the detector signal as a function of tip height. Thus the decay constant is found empirically and is used to interpret the signal obtained during the lateral scan and to set a feedback point for the piezoelectric transducer during constant signal scanning.|$|E
5000|$|His boldness lies in {{realizing that}} he could {{eliminate}} the spherical aberration by placing a thin, very weakly curved aspheric lens (now called the [...] "Schmidt corrector plate") at the same center of curvature as the <b>apertured</b> diaphragm. This aspheric lens has a complex curve that is convex near its middle and concave near its periphery that creates the opposite spherical aberration of the spherical mirror it is paired with, canceling out the mirror's spherical aberration. In this way, very neatly and simply he could construct a large camera of f/1.75 or even faster, that would give sharp images across a field more than 15 degrees in diameter, {{making it possible to}} image large swathes of sky with short exposures (on the order of a few minutes versus an hour or more with a conventional reflector). His first camera had an aperture of about 360mm or 14.5" [...] in diameter, and a focal ratio of f/1.75. It is now housed in a museum at the Hamburg Observatory.

In particular, the [...] "correction plate" [...] was like nothing ever seen before in telescope design. After Schmidt a flood of new catadioptric designs appeared in the subsequent decades.|$|E

The evolved arrays show geometrical phase changes {{as a function of}} the <b>aperture</b> growth rate exponent, e, and the standard deviation of the initial <b>aperture</b> distribution, ?z.

Since laboratory and field investigations evidence a strong degree of variability in fracture <b>aperture,</b> {{a large body of}} literature is specifically concerned with evaluation of an equivalent <b>aperture</b> (or permeability), adopting different constitutive equations and <b>aperture</b> variability models. The equivalent <b>aperture</b> for non-Newtonian fluid flow is defined as the parallel plate <b>aperture</b> which would permit a given volumetric flux under an assigned pressure gradient, thereby generalizing the concept of hydraulic <b>aperture</b> used for Newtonian flow. In this paper, the Bingham model with yield stress  0 has been adopted to describe the fluid rheology; the <b>aperture</b> is taken to vary as a spatially homogeneous and correlated random field with a lognormal <b>aperture</b> density distribution of assigned mean and variance  2. The equivalent fracture <b>aperture</b> is derived for a specific geometry where the flow is perpendicular to the <b>aperture</b> variation.
