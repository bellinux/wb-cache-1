40|$|This paper {{explores the}} bounded query {{complexity}} of <b>approximating</b> the <b>size</b> {{of the maximum}} clique in a graph (Clique Size) {{and the number of}} simultaneously satisfiable clauses in a 3 CNF formula (MaxSat). The results in the paper show that for certain approximation factors, <b>approximating</b> Clique <b>Size</b> and MaxSat are complete for corresponding bounded query classes under metric reductions. The completeness result is important because it shows that queries and approximation are interchangeable: NP queries can be used to solve NP-approximation problems and solutions to NPapproximation problems answer queries to NP oracles. Completeness also shows the existence of approximation preserving reductions from many NP-approximation problems to <b>approximating</b> Clique <b>Size</b> and MaxSat (e. g., from approximating Chromatic Number to <b>approximating</b> Clique <b>Size).</b> Since query complexity is a quantitative complexity measure, these results also provide a framework for comparing the complexities of approximating C [...] ...|$|R
25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by <b>approximate</b> <b>size</b> during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E
500|$|A genet is a {{group of}} genetically {{identical}} individuals that have grown in a given location, all originating vegetatively from a single ancestor. Once established, genets vegetatively spread hyphae out from the root tip into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae. In field studies, the <b>approximate</b> <b>size</b> of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site, determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either somatic incompatibility (a method fungi use to distinguish self from non-self by delimiting their own mycelia from that of other individuals of the same species) or various molecular techniques, and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies. In a 1996 study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S.pungens, an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above-ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying {{only a small fraction of}} the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella sublilacina. Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting. A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect minute genetic differences among S.pungens genets, and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources efficiently. The study also described an S.pungens genet with an area of approximately [...] and a span greater than [...] across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported. The large S.pungens genet was not detected after wildfire, demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.|$|E
