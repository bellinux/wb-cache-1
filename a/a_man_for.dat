5|$|Outside Europe, {{women were}} able to dress as men and go undetected. Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution as a man named Robert Shurtlieff, and pursued {{relationships}} with women. Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland, but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> 23 years in Victoria, marrying three times. Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when he {{was found to be}} Amy Bock, who had married a woman from Port Molyneaux; newspapers argued whether it was a sign of insanity or an inherent character flaw.|$|E

5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> a year.|$|E

5|$|In 1209, the Jain scholar, minister, {{builder of}} temples and army {{commander}} Janna wrote, among other classics, Yashodhara Charite, a {{unique set of}} stories in 310verses dealing with sadomasochism, transmigration of the soul, passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style. In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> his friend's wife. Having killed his friend, the man abducts the wife, who dies of grief. Overcome by repentance, he burns himself on the funeral pyre of the woman. The stories of infatuation reach a peak when Janna writes about the attraction of Amrutamati, the queen, to the ugly mahout Ashtavakra, who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes. This story has piqued the interest of modern researchers. In honour of this work, Janna received the title Kavichakravarthi ("Emperor among poets") from his patron, King Veera BallalaII. His other classic, Anathanatha Purana (1230), is an account {{of the life of the}} 14thtirthankar Ananthanatha.|$|E
