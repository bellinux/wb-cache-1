40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} determinants of trading in the sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) market, using weekly data for single-name sovereign CDS from October 2008 to September 2015. We describe the anatomy of the sovereign CDS market, derive a law of motion for gross positions and their components, and identify the key factors that drive the cross-sectional and time-series properties of trading volume and net notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding.</b> While a single principal component accounts for 54 percent {{of the variation in}} sovereign CDS spreads, the largest common factor explains only 7 percent of the variation in sovereign CDS net notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Moreover, unlike for CDS spreads, common global factors explain very little of the variation in sovereign CDS trading and net notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding,</b> suggesting that it is driven primarily by idiosyncratic country risk. We analyze several local and regional channels that may explain the trading in sovereign CDS: (a) country-specific credit risk shocks, including changes in a country's credit rating and related outlook changes, (b) the announcement and issuance of domestic and international debt, (c) macroeconomic sentiment derived from conventional and unconventional monetary policy, macro-economic news and shocks, and (d) regulatory channels, such as changes in bank capital adequacy requirements.

40|$|Credit default swaps Heading {{towards a}} more stable system The use of credit default swaps (CDSs) has become {{increasingly}} popular over time. Between 2002 and 2007, gross notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> grew from below USD 2 trillion to nearly USD 60 trillion. The recent crisis has revealed several shortcomings in CDS market practices and structure. Lack {{of information on the}} whereabouts of open positions {{as well as on the}} extent of economic risk borne by the financial sector are partly to blame for the heavy reactions observed during the crisis. In addition, management of counterparty risk has proved insufficient, as has in some instances the settlement of contracts following a credit event. Past problems should not distract from the potential benefits of these instruments. In particular, CDSs help complete markets, as they provide an effective means to hedge and trade credit risk. CDSs allow financial institutions to better manage their exposures, and investors benefit from an enhanced investment universe. In addition, CDS spreads provide a valuable market-based assessment of credit conditions. Currently, the CDS market is transforming into {{a more stable}} system. Various private-led measures are being put in place that help enhance market transparency and mitigate operational and systemic risk. In particular, central counterparties have started to operate, which will eventually lead to an improved management of individual as well as system-wide risks...|$|E
40|$|How are markets governed? In {{particular}} {{has there}} been a shift away from the use of bureaucratic regulatory control and public law to the use of a governance model where private actors and private soft law has become more dominant, In this paper, the governance of economic relations is examined in relation to the international market for Over-the-Counter (OTC) sales of derivatives. Notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> on these contracts in 2005 reached over $ 284 billion. Predictability and stability is brought to this market by a complex inter-weaving of private and public action that escapes the simple dichotomy of public versus private governance. Certainly, a key role is played by privately organized rule making, created by the participants in the market and the experts, particularly lawyers, which advise them. These private actors set up their own association in 1984 – the International Swaps and Dealers Association (ISDA) – which has created a Master Agreement that is the common basis to all OTC derivative contracts across the world. In order for the Master Agreement to carry authority, however, it needs to be enforceable in national courts when crises arise. For this reason, the ISDA has been instrumental in engaging with national governments and national legal systems {{in order to ensure that}} the ideals of the Master Agreement are accepted. The paper argues that it is the combination of public and private actors and rules that is most significant to the governance of this market...|$|E

40|$|Developments in repo markets {{during the}} {{financial}} turmoil 1 As {{the financial crisis}} deepened and unsecured interbank markets effectively shut down, repo market activity became increasingly concentrated in the very shortest maturities and against the highest-quality collateral. Repo rates for US Treasury collateral fell relative to overnight index swap rates, while comparable sovereign repo rates in the euro area and the United Kingdom rose. The different dynamics across markets reflected, among other things, differences in the intensity of market disruptions {{and the extent of}} the scarcity of sovereign collateral. JEL classification: E 43, E 58, G 12. Repo markets are a vital source of secured financing for banks and financial institutions, and a key tool for the implementation of monetary policy. A repo, or sale and repurchase agreement, is a sale of a security coupled with an agreement to repurchase the same security at a specified price {{at the end of the}} contract. 2 Repo markets have doubled in size since 2002, with gross <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> at year-end 2007 of roughly $ 10 trillion in each of the US and euro repo markets, and another $ 1 trillion in the UK repo market. This article reviews recent developments in this critical component of the global financial system, with particular focus on the period since the start of the financial turmoil in mid- 2007. Despite the presence of collateral, repo markets were quickly affected by the turmoil. Concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties and the ability to realise the value of the collateral in a sale meant that repo transactions were increasingly restricted to short maturities and against only the highest-quality securities. As financing in unsecured markets became more 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.

40|$|Changing post-trading {{arrangements}} for OTC derivatives 2 The post-trading infrastructure of OTC derivatives markets {{has not always}} kept up with the rapid growth in trading volumes. Recent years have seen some initiatives that seek to introduce multilateral elements that facilitate flows of information between market participants while preserving the decentralised nature of the transactions. While central counterparties lead to the highest degree of mutualisation, other services, such as central information depositories or multilateral terminations, could deliver similar benefits in terms of information management. JEL classification: G 24, G 29, G 32. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets have grown rapidly {{in terms of both}} size and complexity since the BIS started surveying the market in 1995. Daily turnover in OTC foreign exchange and interest rate contracts increased from $ 0. 9 trillion in April 1995 to over $ 4 trillion in April 2007 (Graph 1, lefthand panel). Notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> of OTC derivatives of all types increased more than tenfold between 1995 and 2007, to $ 500 trillion at the end of June 2007, which corresponds to an average rate of growth of over 20 % per year. While most of this growth was driven by increasing volumes in fairly standardised (“plain vanilla”) contracts, there has also been a proliferation of new products, some of which are highly complex. The increase in size and complexity of the OTC derivatives markets naturally raises the issue of whether the risks emanating from such contracts are being properly managed. One area which has repeatedly given cause for concern is the post-trading infrastructure of the market, which has often not matched the rise in volumes and the continued development of new and increasingly complex products. The most visible indicator of deficiencies in post-trading processes has been the backlog in trades pending confirmation. 1 Manager, Risk Management Division, Euroclear SA/NV.

40|$|Do {{syndicated}} credits anticipate BIS consolidated banking data? 1 Commercial data on international syndicated credit facilities are available {{three months earlier}} than the BIS consolidated banking statistics and provide information on many characteristics of the individual facilities. On the other hand, BIS data reflect actual loan drawdowns and repayments while syndicated loan data are based on announcements of facilities {{that may or may}} not be drawn. Nonetheless, syndicated loans account for a significant part of actual international bank claims and should thus contain information to complement the BIS data. 2 In this article we compare the two data sets, adjusting for conceptual and practical differences. The comparison allows us to better understand both the nature of the consolidated claims reported to the BIS and the way syndicated facilities are used. Moreover, we find that, under certain conditions and for certain classes of borrowers, the more timely syndicated credit data can provide some useful advance information about the consolidated data. Filtering {{syndicated credits}} A direct comparison of the two data sets is less than straightforward. As shown in Table 1, while syndicated credit data are a mixture of domestic and international lending facilities, the BIS banking statistics focus exclusively on international lending. The syndicated credits are gross announcements of loan facilities (ie loan commitments which need not be drawn down fully or immediately), while the changes in <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> in the BIS data are driven mainly by net new lending (actual disbursements).
