2500|$|McRae {{wrote letters}} {{describing}} {{the actions of}} the Maryland Campaign that survived as of today. In particular, he noted that at the Battle of South Mountain he was able to keep Garland's brigade fighting for two more hours after Samuel Garland death. At Antietam, he admitted that, [...] "the unaccountable panic occurred, when I was left along on the field, with only Capatin Withers of Caswell and perhaps one other officer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> gotten off, when I encountered ... General Lee, and it was while, with him I was trying to get some men out of the Hay Stacks that a piece of shell struck me in the forehead." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR WEG, - <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> {{written the}} best note to Mrs. Gosse {{that was in}} my power. Most blameable.|$|E
60|$|I {{went down}} very slow the next time, {{and anybody who}} 'as been down an iron ladder with thin, cold rungs, in their bare feet, will know why, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> dipped my left foot in, when the wharf-bell rang.|$|E
60|$|Twelve o'clock <b>has</b> struck, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{come back}} to close these pages, after looking out at my open window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, Uncle Jake," [...] said John briskly. [...] "My cousin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been {{notified}} to expect you. We are both Carterets, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, Blink, old pard," [...] said Pan, {{breathing}} heavily. [...] "Louise <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> made up {{our minds}} {{to get drunk}} together. Blink, you stay sober." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{a capital}} plan of yourn, young fellow," [...] John Little said. [...] "I don't {{know how we}} ever should have got across the other way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> {{made up my mind}} to give it up and move down this hollow till we came to firmer ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well no, Squire--that is, I had a rare hunt after him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> {{happened}} of him {{up a tree}} {{when you}} began to halloa so loud, that he went nigh to falling out of it, so I {{had to tell him}} to come back next week, or the week after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] was the answer. [...] "'Tis more direct, you see, no shoals, and {{the young}} gentlemen will get to their own homes and beds all the quicker. Now, miss, you {{will come in and}} take a cup of tea, I am sure you want it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> made it when Norris saw the little lads." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{friend has}} acted more than fairly," [...] I said. [...] "We can pay off all debts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{concluded}} a big new, profitable deal!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since Lord Scroope {{has been}} so ill, Lady Scroope has been {{sleeping}} in the little room next to his, downstairs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> come from her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, unexpectedly, Bob Sidney telephoned {{to her at}} {{her flat}} one evening: [...] "Partner <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> decided to take you on, if you'll come at thirty-eight hundred a year." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was eight}} years old, and an unusually hot summer was at its height. It was past midday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come out from the house, with the {{intention}} of settling down for an afternoon's reading in a shady corner of the orchard. I had reached the stack-yard gate when I stopped short, my hand upon the fastening.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{about a week}} or {{ten days}} went by <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come reluctantly to the {{conclusion}} that there must be some truth in the old mediaeval legends which tell us that the devil runs away with his elect from time to time, when I received a summons from M. the Commissary of Police to present myself at his bureau.|$|E
60|$|To-day, twenty-eight days out, in {{the early}} morning, while I was {{drinking}} my coffee, still carrying the north-east trade, we crossed the line. And Charles Davis signalized the event by murdering O'Sullivan. It was Boney, the lanky splinter of a youth in Mr. Mellaire's watch, who brought the news. The second mate <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> arrived in the hospital room, when Mr. Pike entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] he replied, [...] "but I feel uncommonly hungry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been {{wondering}} how {{you manage to}} feed when at sea in so small a craft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard, Lady Eustace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> come {{to offer}} you my sympathy. When I was told that you did see people, I thought that perhaps you would admit me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want help, sir," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "I am a pupil at Putnam Hall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{spotted a}} fellow {{in this neighborhood}} who robbed my brother of a gold watch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Monsieur Duchesne {{himself was}} in town, and madame, Myra, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> time {{to gain the}} forest. There we were joined by Dinah, who did {{everything}} for us. Madame was attacked by fever, but fortunately Dinah knew of a very safe place of refuge. She did everything for us, fetched up provisions, concocted medicine, and after being ten days in hiding, {{we were able to}} get them down to the town." ...|$|E
60|$|I made a low reverence, terribly abashed, and I fear {{it would}} have reduced my mother to despair, {{but it was an}} honour that I appreciated; for now that I was a married woman, I was {{permitted}} to read romances, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> begun on the first volume of the Grand Curus. My husband read it to me as I worked at my embroidery, and you may guess how we enjoyed it.|$|E
60|$|He {{flung open}} the door and we rushed in. She was there on the ground amidst the {{splinters}} of her chair. We seized her and dragged her swiftly out, and as we gained the door I looked over my shoulder into the darkness. There were two strange eyes glowing at us, a rattle of hoofs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> time to slam the door when there came a crash upon it which split it from top to bottom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> seen her; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{returned}} to my own house. My distress of mind is great. But I will {{do my best to}} write intelligibly and fully of what has happened.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{proved that}} Mr. [...] "Commissioner" [...] Booth-Clibborn asserts the exact {{contrary}} {{of that which}} your report of {{the judgment of the}} Master of the Rolls tells us that distinguished judge said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not one {{of those}} {{fortunate}} persons who possess one," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{spend a great deal of}} time in Norfolk with my brother, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> a couple of rooms in town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lightfoot was his name, sir; {{a divine}} he was, and {{another kind of}} a divine than they hae now-adays. Always, I crave your pardon for keeping ye {{standing}} at the door, but having been mistrysted (gude preserve us!) with ae bogle the night already, I was dubious o' opening the yett till I had gaen through the e'ening worship; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> finished the fifth chapter of Nehemiah--if that winna gar them keep their distance, I wotna what will." ...|$|E
6000|$|From my ledge to {{the base}} of the cliff is a matter of several {{thousand}} feet of dangerous climbing; yet I venture to say that the first ape from whose loins my line has descended never could have equaled the speed with which I literally dropped down the face of that rugged escarpment. The last two hundred feet is over a steep incline of loose rubble to the valley bottom, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> reached the top of this when there arose to my ears an agonized cry--"Bowen! Bowen! Quick, my love, quick!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} half-way on my road home, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> heard the clock {{of a village}} church strike ten, when I became conscious, little by little, of a chilly {{sensation}} slowly creeping through and through me to the bones. The warm, balmy air of a summer night was abroad. It was the month of July. In the month of July, {{was it possible that}} any living creature (in good health) could feel cold? It was not possible--and yet, the chilly sensation still crept through and through me to the bones.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, come, Marie, the day {{is growing}} warm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a long quarrel with Dolph, which has {{fatigued}} me excessively; so, pray be agreeable, now, and let a fellow repose {{in the light of}} your smile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shadow the Weasel," [...] replied Chatterer, {{still in}} a very low voice, {{as if he were}} afraid of being overheard. [...] "Shadow the Weasel is back in the Green Forest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> such a narrow escape!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good-bye!' said Mr Meagles. 'This is {{the last}} good-bye upon the list, for Mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> said it to Mr Clennam here, and he only waits to say it to Pet. Good-bye! We may never meet again.' ...|$|R
60|$|Well, Sir, on {{that day}} in September--it was the tenth, I remember--1816, I must confess that I was feeling {{exceedingly}} dejected. Not one client {{for the last three}} weeks, half a franc in my pocket, and nothing but a small quarter of Strasburg patty in the larder. Theodore had eaten most of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> sent him out to buy two sous' worth of stale bread wherewith to finish the remainder. But after that? You will admit, Sir, that a less buoyant spirit would not have remained so long undaunted.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It {{was about}} a {{fortnight}} after the festivities, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come in with some friends from an afternoon's shooting, when I was told that a gentleman from abroad--the servant believed--was waiting {{to see me in}} the library. Even as he spoke the words I seemed to know who it was. My heart sank, and the presentiment of some coming evil was strong upon me. I hesitated, and then, feverishly anxious to know the worst, I turned away with some careless excuse to my guests and entered the library.|$|E
60|$|Queequeg <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> {{left the}} Pequod, and were sauntering {{away from the}} water, for the moment each {{occupied}} with his own thoughts, when the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.|$|E
6000|$|... "They both coughed arter that, {{and like}} a goodnatured fool I stood 'em a sixpenny cigar apiece, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>just</b> turned {{to go back to}} my seat when up come two more hands from the Lizzie and Annie.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a moment, mademoiselle," [...] {{he replied}} lightly, [...] "my friend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{finished}} our talk. May <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the honour to present him?--Sir Percy Blakeney, a traveller from England. Blakeney, this is Mademoiselle Juliette de Marny, my mother's guest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] growled {{the other}} man, impatiently. [...] "The girls <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> come from Europe. We've had enough sea to last us all this season, at least. What we pine for is country life--pure milk, apple trees and new mown hay." ...|$|R
