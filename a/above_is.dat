5|$|Although Pluto is {{currently}} the largest known KBO, {{there is at least}} one known larger object currently outside the Kuiper belt that probably originated in it: Neptune's moon Triton (which, as explained <b>above,</b> <b>is</b> probably a captured KBO).|$|E
5|$|Hexachloroplatinic acid {{mentioned}} <b>above</b> <b>is</b> {{probably the}} most important platinum compound, as it serves as the precursor for many other platinum compounds. By itself, it has various applications in photography, zinc etchings, indelible ink, plating, mirrors, porcelain coloring, and as a catalyst.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the highly}} cototient numbers are odd. In fact, after 8, all the numbers listed <b>above</b> <b>are</b> odd, and after 167 all the numbers listed <b>above</b> <b>are</b> {{congruent}} to 29 modulo 30.|$|R

5|$|The <b>above</b> <b>is</b> some of Whitehead's most evocative {{writing about}} God, and was {{powerful}} enough to inspire the movement known as process theology, a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.|$|E
5|$|The effect (2–3%, as <b>above)</b> <b>is</b> due {{to changes}} within the Earth's atmosphere; {{the value of}} the solar {{radiation}} {{at the top of the}} atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.|$|E
25|$|The <b>above</b> {{definitions}} <b>are</b> {{inadequate for}} many technical applications. In fact, the definitions <b>above</b> <b>are</b> specializations {{of the following}} definitions.|$|R

5|$|The series {{definition}} <b>above</b> <b>is</b> {{a simple}} way to define the real number named by a decimal expansion. A complementary approach is tailored to the opposite process: for a given real number, define the decimal expansion(s) to name it.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{biological}} {{definition of}} a fish, <b>above,</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called a true fish. True fish are {{also referred to as}} finfish or fin fish to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Above</b> <b>is</b> the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E

5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined <b>above)</b> <b>is</b> short {{compared to}} the physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are more important than those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E
5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups {{and examples of}} other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined <b>above)</b> <b>is</b> also a set, so a group is a group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E
5|$|Neurological {{evaluations}} to {{help determine}} the degree of impairment are performed initially and repeatedly {{in the early stages}} of treatment; this determines the rate of improvement or deterioration and informs treatment and prognosis. The ASIA Impairment Scale outlined <b>above</b> <b>is</b> used to determine the level and severity of injury.|$|E

30|$|Objectives {{shown in}} bold <b>above</b> <b>were</b> fully achieved, {{as well as}} some new {{originally}} unanticipated objectives described in the section below. Those shown in italics <b>above</b> <b>were</b> partially achieved, whilst those shown in normal font were not attempted due to the time constraints of the project.|$|R
5|$|None of {{the major}} {{subspecies}} is under threat, but exsul, as noted <b>above,</b> <b>is</b> probably extinct. There is a slow population increase of common chiffchaff in the Czech Republic. The range of at least P. c. collybita seems to be expanding, with northward advances in Scotland, Norway and Sweden and a large population increase in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The PEC's {{decision}} as to whether a candidate fulfils the two requirements mentioned <b>above</b> <b>is</b> final and not subject to appeal or judicial review in any court. The PEC is not constitutionally required to provide any justification for its decision. In the absence of malice, the Committee is immune from a defamation suit when it discharges its functions under the Presidential Elections Act.|$|E
5|$|The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization {{state that}} a {{blood lead level}} of 10μg/dL or <b>above</b> <b>is</b> a cause for concern; however, lead may impair {{development}} and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, {{and there is no}} known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10μg/dL.|$|E

5|$|The north range {{houses the}} library and senior common rooms; {{designed}} in the Neoclassical style by James Wyatt, it was built between 1788 and 1796 to accommodate the books bequested by Edward, Baron Leigh, formerly High Steward of the University and an Orielensis, whose gift had doubled {{the size of the}} library. The two-storey building has rusticated arches on the ground floor and a row of Ionic columns above, dividing the façade into seven bays — the ground floor contains the first purpose built senior common rooms in Oxford, <b>above</b> <b>is</b> the library.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} described <b>above</b> <b>is</b> {{sustained by the}} neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail plasma sheet, the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause. These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere. They also interact substantially with the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{a matrix}} {{is defined by the}} number of rows and columns that it contains. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m×n matrix or m-by-n matrix, while m and n are called its dimensions. For example, the matrix A <b>above</b> <b>is</b> a 3×2 matrix.|$|E
