5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> thinner skin such as is {{found on the}} ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Knox, Romanelli arrived at the flat. Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging <b>around,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> anything that might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene. On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with her had been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a duvet.|$|E
25|$|In {{his history}} of the 32nd Armoured Regiment, Maurizio Parri wrote that a company of the II Medium Tank Battalion with its M11/39s had tried to {{counter-attack}} the British Matildas but the crews misunderstood flag signals, which caused delays and the attack failed. In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to his tent with a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen {{at the entrance of}} his tent when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water. New equipment, weapons and ammunition strewed the ground, already disappearing under the sand and dozens of dug-outs were found to be full of food, new equipment and ammunition.|$|E

500|$|The caddisflies, {{or order}} Trichoptera, are {{a group of}} insects with aquatic larvae and {{terrestrial}} adults. There are approximately 14,500 described species, [...] most {{of which can be}} divided into the suborders Integripalpia and Annulipalpia {{on the basis of the}} adult mouthparts. Integripalpian larvae construct a portable casing to protect themselves as they move <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> food, while Annulipalpian larvae make themselves a fixed retreat in which they remain, waiting for food to come to them. The affinities of the small third suborder Spicipalpia are unclear, and molecular analysis suggests it may not be monophyletic. Also called sedge-flies or rail-flies, the adults are small moth-like insects with two pairs of hairy membranous wings. They are closely related to the Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) which have scales on their wings; the two orders together form the superorder Amphiesmenoptera.|$|E

His stepfather, whom his mother Elisabeth married seven years later, was hostile to {{education}} and thus Johannes could only learn in secret and with many difficulties.

2500|$|Wold {{left home}} at 13 [...] to avoid abuse {{at the hands}} of his stepfather, and lived rough and on the road in Tennessee, Mississippi and elsewhere, until 1973. He would travel long {{distances}} by hopping freight trains, looking for work as a farm laborer or in other seasonal jobs, often living as a hobo. At various times, Wold worked at a carnival, as a cowboy and as a migrant worker. Wold described this time of his life by saying [...] "Hobos are people who move <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> work, tramps are people who move around but don't look for work, and bums are people who don't move and don't work. I've been all three." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGraw's father (whose {{name was}} also John) {{and his older}} brother Michael immigrated from Ireland in 1856. Their last name is spelled [...] "McGrath" [...] but {{pronounced}} McGraw. He and his brother had arrived in time for the Civil War, and were drawn into the conflict as part of the Union army. Shortly after the war, he married; and McGraw's older half-sister was born. John McGraw, Sr.'s first wife died, and he began moving <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> work — a search that ultimately led him to Truxton, New York, in 1871. It was there that the elder John McGraw married young Ellen Comerfort. They had the younger John McGraw on April 7, 1873.|$|E
2500|$|Pearse and {{his brother}} Willie and sisters Margaret and Mary Brigid were born at 27 Great Brunswick Street, Dublin, the street that is named after them today. It was here that their father, James Pearse, {{established}} a stonemasonry business in the 1850s, a business which flourished and provided the Pearses with a comfortable middle-class upbringing. Pearse's father was a mason and monumental sculptor, and originally a Unitarian from Birmingham in England. Pearse's maternal grandfather Patrick was {{a supporter of the}} 1848 Young Ireland movement and was sworn into the IRB. Pearse recalls attending a ballad singer perform republican songs, afterwords he went <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> armed men ready to fight, he found none and declared sadly to his grandfather that [...] "the fenians are all dead".

6000|$|... "Then maybe it's safe to {{say what}} I think of authors--and more or less of poets and {{painters}} and so on.

That's where I first got my grouch on them, and I've never really got over it; and coming here to-night and hearing the littery talk I've been thinking how these authors have a sort of an admiration trust. They make authors the heroes of their stories and so on, and so they make people think that writing is sacred. I'm so sick of reading novels about how young Bill, as had a pure white soul, came to New York and had an 'orrible time till his great novel was accepted. Authors seem to think they're the only ones that have ideals. Now I'm in the automobile business, and I help to make people get out into the country--bet a lot more of them get out because of motoring than because of reading poetry about spring. But if I claimed a temperament because I introduce the motorist's soul to the daisy, every one would die laughing." ...|$|E
