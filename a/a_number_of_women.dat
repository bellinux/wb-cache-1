5|$|All {{the titles}} {{are open to}} men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are available.

5|$|Imagist {{publications}} appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured {{works by}} many of the most prominent modernist figures in poetry and other fields. The Imagist group was centered in London, with members from Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. Somewhat unusually for the time, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> writers were major Imagist figures.|$|E

5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} al-Birwa's {{inhabitants}} {{participated in the}} 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa {{who had participated in}} the revolt. Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al-Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me'ari-Abu Sa'ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me'ari, Muhammad al-Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> from al-Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003–2004 recalled that during the revolt, local rebels set off a mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. In particular, the British authorities gathered men from al-Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed the men on top of the cactuses.|$|E

5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> who had died {{during the war and}} these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted that winds probably blew {{water out of}} the gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage from the wind was generally minor, while most of the impact wrought by the storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city was flooded, with the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about halfway up the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles and wires were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E
25|$|In German South-West Africa {{during the}} Herero and Namaqua Genocide, German {{soldiers}} regularly engaged in gang rapes before killing Herero women or leaving {{them in the}} desert to die; <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> from the rebelling Herero tribe were also forced into prostitution.|$|E

40|$|Dollar et al. (2001) sparked off {{research}} on gender and corruption. They showed, in a cross-country comparative study, that <b>a</b> high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in elected office {{is related to}} {{a low level of}} corruption. Whether there is a causal relationship is, however, disputed. Sung (2003) has argued that modern liberal democracy is the driving force behind <b>a</b> high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> elected, as well as government accountability. This paper focuses on subnational variation in Mexico. Data from Transparency International indicate that corruption is ten times more likely to occur in requesting or receiving public services in the state most hit by corruption than in the state least affected. There is also considerable variation in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> elected, and the subnational analysis confirms previous cross-country findings: states with <b>a</b> high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> elected tend to display lower levels of corruption than states with <b>a</b> low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> elected. The Mexican case strengthens the idea that there are important links between gender and corruption. This paper launches a “rationality perspective,” arguing that when calculating costs and benefits, women more often than men choose to abstain from corrupt behavior...|$|R

25|$|The {{title of}} Grandmaster, {{along with the}} lesser FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and FIDE Master (FM), is open to both men and women.

25|$|The crisis {{took place}} from 14 June to 19 June 1995, {{when a group}} of 80 to 200 Chechen separatists led by Shamil Basayev {{attacked}} the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk, where they stormed the main police station and the city hall. After several hours of fighting and Russian reinforcements imminent, the Chechens retreated to the residential district and regrouped in the city hospital, where they took between 1,500 and 1,800 hostages, most of them civilians (including about 150 children and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> with newborn infants).|$|E
25|$|In mid-871, the Abbasid {{government}} {{desired to}} initiate a new offensive against the Zanj, and sent Bughraj to press Sa'id ibn Salih on the matter.

There he encountered a rebel army on a tributary canal, and despite being wounded he succeeded in routing the Zanj.
