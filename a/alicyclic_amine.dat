This strain {{was able to}} utilize pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperidine, piperazine, and 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine as the sole sources of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. The degradation pathway of pyrrolidine as the best substrate for cellular growth was proposed based on the assays of substrate-induced cytochrome P 450 and constitutive enzyme activities toward 4 -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and succinic semialdehyde (SSA). Its 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequence (16 S rDNA) was identical to that of Mycobacterium tokaiense ATCC 27282 (T). The morABC genes responsible for <b>alicyclic</b> <b>amine</b> degradation were nearly identical among different species of Mycobacteria. Remarkably, repetitive sequences at the intergenic spacer (IGS) region between morC and orf 1 ' were detected by comparison of the nearly identical mor gene cluster regions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program was the behaviour of polar nitrogen compounds in the drinking water treatment process. In addition, studies about the determination of polar nitrogen compounds in surface waters were carried out continuing the research project WT 9356 / 7. The determination of the regarded aliphatic and <b>alicyclic</b> <b>amines,</b> the aliphatic diamines and the ethanolamines as well as N-(phenylsulfonyl) -sarkosin (SPS) and coffeine in surface waters {{was carried out in}} samples mixed over a period of one month as well as sample tests. Based on the determined concentrations and the frequency of their occurrence in the regarded surface waters morpholine, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine and diethanolamine are to assess as relevant for the drinking water supply from bank filtrates. The technological investigations included the treatment steps microbiological degradation, flocculation, ozonation, disinfection with chlorine and chlorine dioxide as well as the combination of the treatment methods and were carried out using model and natural waters. Resulting from the technological attempts it was shown that expected diethylamine all regarded compounds were removed from the water either by microbiological degradation or by ozonation. In contrast, flocculation and disinfection with chlorine and chlorine dioxide were not suited for the elimination of the polar nitrogen compounds from the water. In further investigations with the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>amines,</b> for exmaple, a correlation between the chemical structure and the microbiological degradation was demonstrated. It was shown after that the reaction mechanism, the chemical structure as well as the degree of protonation of the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>amines</b> influence the reaction-rate of the ozonation.

For this purpose a previously reported HPLC procedure (Porta et al., 1981 a) was modified to analyze the cerebral levels of DCHA {{at the time of}} polyamine determinations. The intraperitoneally injected DCHA was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier easily, reaching high levels in the cerebral tissue (~ 750 nmol/g brain) within 1 h of its administration. The effect of the drug on the polyamine metabolism resulted in a significant depletion of Spd biosynthesis from the sixth hour after the treatment and in an earlier and prolonged increase of the putrescine (Pt) steady-state levels. Conversely, the spermine (Spm) endogenous pools remained unchanged throughout the 24 -h post-DCHA period.

We have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli the CHAO-encoding gene (chaA) from B. oxydans, purified CHAO and determined the structures of both the holoenzyme form of the enzyme and a product complex with cyclohexanone. CHAO is a 50 kDa monomer with a PHBH fold topology. It belongs to the flavin monooxygenase family of enzymes and exhibits high substrate specificity for <b>alicyclic</b> <b>amines</b> and sec-alkylamines.

Since CHAO has a buried hydrophobic active site with no obvious route for substrates and products, a random acceleration molecular dynamics simulation has been used to identify a potential egress route. The path identified includes an intermediate cavity and requires transient conformation changes in a shielding loop and a residue at the border of the substrate-binding cavity.

This work reports the electrochemical oxidation of 8 - and 10 -membered ring dichalcogenides appended with β-silicon and tin substituents. The heterocycles with tellurium undergo reversible oxidation but those with sulfur or selenium are irreversibly oxidized. The ionization energies of these mesocyclic chalcogenoethers were determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. These lowest ionization energies reflect substantial (0. 53 - 0. 75 eV) orbital destabilizations due to the neighboring C-Si or C-Sn bonds. In particular, a novel Si-Si effect on the ionization of these β-disilyl sulfides and selenides was found by PES measurements. Fe₂S₂(CO) ₆ clusters with a C-Sn or C-Sn-C moiety bridging the sulfur atoms or a CH₂SnMe₃ group attached to each sulfur have also been studied by photoelectron spectroscopy. Stannylation lowers the ionization energy of sulfur lone pair orbitals in these systems owing to a geometry dependent interaction as well as the Fe-Fe HOMO. Additionally, various sulfur and phosphine substituted hydroquinone and catechol redox ligands have been synthesized to append to iron sulfur clusters. Lastly, model m-terphenyl methyl and phenyl chalcogenoethers that will be further used to study cationic aromatic-chalcogen interactions have been synthesized in either of two ways. Suzuki couplings of 2, 6 -dibromoaniline and (2, 6 -diiodo- 4 -methylphenyl) (methyl) sulfane afford m-terphenyl methyl thioethers in 27 - 42 % yield. Deprotonation of 1, 3 -dichlorobenzene and treatment with substituted aryl Grignard reagents generated m-terphenyl anions which were quenched with alkyl or aryl dichalcogenides to give m-terphenyl chalcogenoethers in 16 - 74 % yields. A new synthesis of phenyl m-terphenyl chalcogenoethers was found. Treatment of substituted iodo-m-terphenyls with diphenyl dichalcogenides using CsOH⋅H₂O in DMSO affords phenyl m-terphenyl chalcogenoethers in 19 - 84 % yields.

All the amines studied are less reactive in MeCN than in H 2 O although they are more basic in the aprotic solvent by 7 - 9 pKa units. The Brønsted-type plot is linear with βnuc = 0. 40, which is slightly larger than that reported previously for the corresponding reactions in H 2 O (βnuc = 0. 27). Product analysis has shown that only E-isomer is produced. Kinetic isotope effect is absent for the reactions of 2 with morpholine and deuterated morpholine (i. e., kH/kD = 1. 0).

The higher acidity of 2 -furoic acid (pKa = 3. 16) compared with benzoic acid (pKa = 4. 20) has been suggested to be responsible for the reactivity order, at least in part. The Brønsted-type plots for the reactions of 1 and 2 are curved downwardly, indicating that the aminolyses of both 1 and 2 proceed through a zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate (T±) with a change in the rate-determining step on changing the amine basicity. Dissection of the kN values into their microscopic rate constants has revealed that the pKao and k 2 /k– 1 ratios for the reactions of 1 and 2 are identical, indicating that the nature of the nonleaving group (i. e., benzoyl and 2 -furoyl) does not affect the reaction mechanism.

Dissection of kobsd into the second- and third-order rate constants (i. e., Kk 2 and Kk 3, respectively) reveals that Kk 3 is significantly larger than Kk 2, indicating that the reactions proceed mainly through the deprotonation pathway (i. e., the k 3 process) in a high [amine] region. This contrasts to the recent report that the corresponding aminolysis of benzyl 2 -pyridyl carbonate 5 proceeds through a forced concerted mechanism. An intramolecular H-bonding interaction was suggested to force the reactions of 5 to proceed through a concerted mechanism, since it could accelerate the rate of leaving-group expulsion (i. e., an increase in k 2). However, such H-bonding interaction, which could increase k 2, is structurally impossible for the reactions of 6.

The Brønsted-type plots are linear with βnuc = 0. 48 - 0. 51. The Hammett plots for the reactions of 2 a-f exhibit poor correlations but the corresponding Yukawa-Tsuno plots result in much better linear correlations with ρ = 1. 57 and r = 0. 46 for the reactions with piperidine while ρ = 1. 72 and r = 0. 39 for those with morpholine. The amines employed in this study are less reactive in MeCN than in water for reactions with sub-strates possessing an EDG, although they are ca. 8 pKa units more basic in the aprotic solvent. This indicates that the transition state (TS) is significantly more destabilized than the ground state (GS) in the aprotic solvent. It has been con-cluded that the reactions proceed through a stepwise mechanism with a partially charged TS, since such TS would be destabilized in the aprotic solvent due to the electronic repulsion between the negative-dipole end of MeCN and the nega-tive charge of the TS.

The Brønsted-type plot for the aminolysis of 8 c (X = H) is linear with βnuc = 0. 77 and R 2 = 0. 991 (Figure 1), which is typical for reactions reported previously to proceed through a stepwise mechanism with break-down of a zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate T ± being the rate-determining step (RDS), e. g., aminolysis of 4 -nitro-phenyl benzoate 1 c. The Hammett plot for the reactions of 8 a-e with piperidine consists of two intersecting straight lines (Figure 2), i. e., ρ = 1. 71 for substrates possessing an electron-donating group (EDG) while ρ = 0. 86 for those bearing an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). Traditionally, such a nonlinear Hammett plot has been interpreted as a change in RDS upon changing substituent X in the benzoyl moiety.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Cytochrome P 450 enzymes {{constitute}} a superfamily of isoforms which accelerate {{the removal of}} foreign compounds from the body through oxidative biotransformation to generate polar metabolites that are more readily excreted from the body. Hence, susceptibility to oxidation by cytochrome P 450 may largely determine the in vivo half-life, plasma level, and tissue exposure of small molecule drugs. As the P 450 isoforms involved in drug metabolism contain large, flexible, and promiscuous active sites which can bind and metabolize multiple drugs, {{it is common for}} one drug to interfere with the metabolism of another. Inhibition of a specific P 450 isoform may lead to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) through impairment of metabolic clearance of a coadministered drug and the build-up of this drug or its metabolites to toxic levels in the body. The use of in vitro data to predict, rationalize and, ultimately, prevent DDIs is a top priority in drug development. Accordingly, emphasis in this field of study has been placed on understanding which drug structures inhibit P 450 and the mechanism by which inhibition occurs. This dissertation explores the mechanism of inhibition of cytochrome P 450 1 A 2 (CYP 1 A 2) by the fluoroquinolone antibacterial enoxacin. Enoxacin elicits clinically-significant DDIs with theophylline and caffeine due to potent CYP 1 A 2 inhibition in vivo. However, enoxacin is characterized as a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP 1 A 2 in vitro leading to severe underprediction of the DDIs with theophylline and caffeine. Herein, we have clarified the mechanism of inhibition as a time-dependent irreversible process where enoxacin is sequentially metabolized within the CYP 1 A 2 active site to a mechanism-based inhibitor. Thus, CYP 1 A 2 is inactivated by a metabolite of enoxacin through formation of a metabolic-intermediate (MI) complex. The mechanism of MI complex formation requires N-hydroxylation of the piperazine ring of enoxacin followed by -carbon hydroxylation and oxidative ring-opening to a nitroso metabolite that strongly ligates to the ferrous heme iron of CYP 1 A 2. We elucidated the mechanism of CYP 1 A 2 inactivation as sequential metabolism of the piperazine ring to an MI complex in recombinant CYP 1 A 2 and confirmed that this mechanism is still viable in human liver microsomes. Circumstantial evidence was provided for MI complex formation with CYP 1 A 2 in primary human hepatocytes. The DDIs with theophylline and caffeine were well-predicted by in vitro to in vivo predictions using apparent CYP 1 A 2 inactivation parameters for the parent drug, enoxacin. Our results suggest that enoxacin is sequentially metabolized to an MI complex non-dissociatively within the CYP 1 A 2 active site and that released metabolite intermediates do not significantly contribute to MI complex formation. The non-dissociative nature of the sequential metabolic inactivation process accounts for our success in predicting the DDIs with theophylline and caffeine using apparent inactivation parameters of the parent drug. Although enoxacin requires multiple CYP 1 A 2 -mediated oxidations to inactivate CYP 1 A 2, enoxacin can be treated as a single-step inactivator (i. e. a true mechanism-based inhibitor) for DDI prediction purposes. In our view, non-dissociative sequential inactivation accounts not only for the success of our prediction, but also the potent inhibition of CYP 1 A 2 in vivo. Our observation that N-hydroxy enoxacin, an intermediate hydroxylamine metabolite, is reduced back to enoxacin in human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes calls into question whether a dissociative sequential inactivation process would be viable in vivo. Futile cycling between enoxacin and the N-hydroxy enoxacin metabolite could theoretically prevent the sequential metabolic process from progressing beyond the hydroxylamine, thus highlighting the importance of non-dissociative sequential metabolism. In summary, we proposed enoxacin is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP 1 A 2 through non-dissociative sequential metabolism of the piperazine ring to an MI complex. This is the first report of sequential metabolism of a piperazine by a cytochrome P 450 to an MI complex. It is suggested that MI complex formation may result from sequential metabolism of other alicyclic amine-containing substrates and that <b>alicyclic</b> <b>amines</b> may be a new structural alert for MI complex formation...|$|R
