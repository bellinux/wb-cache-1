5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria {{spent the}} autumn and winter of 1643 in Oxford with Charles, where she attempted, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> to {{maintain}} the pleasant court life that they had enjoyed before the war. The Queen lived in the Warden's lodgings in Merton College, adorned with the royal furniture which had been brought up from London. The Queen's usual companions were present: Denbigh, Davenant, her dwarves; her rooms were overrun by dogs, including Mitte. The atmosphere in Oxford {{was a combination of}} a fortified city and a royal court, and Henrietta Maria was frequently stressed with worry.|$|E
25|$|The British hired armed cutter Sandwich {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and {{cruising}} off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere realized that they were enemy vessels and attempted to sail away. The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur, to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Créole.|$|E

She was born at the backstage of a Cantonese opera travelling troupe that was coincidentally was in town for a performance. Jin Yu's mother was devastated to find out her firstborn daughter was born with broken lines on both of her palms.

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of her own father and tried, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Ariadne had been rotated {{out of the front}} patrol line and laid at anchor in the {{entrance}} of the Weser River in support of the cruisers and torpedo boats on patrol. After receiving reports of the British attack on {{the morning of}} the 28th, Ariadne and several other cruisers got up steam and rushed to support the German patrols. She met [...] at around 13:40, but less than twenty minutes thereafter, Beatty's battlecruisers, chasing , arrived and began firing on Ariadne as well. She turned to starboard and attempted to flee. She was hit several times by the British guns, and one hit the forward boiler room. The coal bunker caught fire and five boilers were disabled; her speed fell to [...] Two battlecruisers closed in, until they were firing their [...] guns at a distance of , point-blank range for guns of that caliber.

5000|$|His son James {{became an}} {{alcoholic}} and eventually died penniless on 16 October 1894. On 5 August 1876, James Gapes (junior) was fined 20s for [...] "drunkenness, assaulting and resisting the police". As {{the case had}} {{been reported in the}} newspaper and due to father and son sharing their first name, Gapes (senior) took out an advertisement later that month to protect his reputation. Alice Gapes (née Swindell, married 1875), the wife of James Gapes (junior), outlived him by eight years. The Christchurch City Library holds an interesting biography on her, not because she had a public persona, but {{as an example of a}} woman coping <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> during the Victorian time.|$|R

500|$|Rudolf Kempe, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} associate conductor in 1960, became principal conductor in 1961 and music director in 1962. Beecham's widow ran {{the affairs of the}} orchestra <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but some senior players including Brymer and MacDonagh were unhappy with the management, and they left. The orchestra reorganised itself in 1963 as a self-governing limited company, but almost immediately encountered difficulties. The Royal Philharmonic Society decided not to engage the RPO for its concerts; Glyndebourne booked the LPO instead of the RPO from 1964 onwards. The RPO was also excluded from the London Orchestral Concert Board's schedule of concerts, which meant that it was denied the use of London's main concert venue, the Royal Festival Hall. [...] Kempe resigned, although he returned shortly afterwards. Helped by strong support from [...] Sir Malcolm Sargent, the orchestra successfully mounted its own concerts at a cinema in Swiss Cottage, [...] to the north-west of the Festival Hall. A 1965 report to the Arts Council by a committee chaired by Alan Peacock recommended that all four independent London orchestras should receive adequate public subsidy.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{widely read}} popular biographies appeared. Stirling Seagrave's [...] Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China portrays Cixi {{as a woman}} stuck between the xenophobic faction of Manchu nobility and more {{moderate}} influences. The empress dowager, Seagrave argues, did not crave power but simply acted to balance these influences and protect the Qing dynasty <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Travelling to the cape, a man fell {{overboard}} in high seas. Tryon had to {{make the}} difficult decision whether to try to rescue him, because any small boat risked sinking, taking her crew down also. However, the man was seen to be swimming strongly, so the ship was halted and a boat launched to rescue him. The boat got away well, though was sucked back under the stern of the ship before breaking free. The ship then had to manoeuvre under sail, tacking <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to follow the boat while keeping it on the safe side for recovery. [...] All went well, and Tryon received congratulations from the other captains for his skill in carrying out the rescue.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, {{his parents}} divorced. It {{is not certain}} whether Van Meegeren {{followed}} his mother to Paris at that time or remained in The Hague. It is known, however, that in 1927 he went {{with his mother and}} sister to Sumatra. They went to live there with his mother's family, who were directly related to the Sultan of Serdang. Van Meegeren attended the government HBS - a high school - in nearby Medan, traveling every day in a little steam train. A charming incident occurred at that time:Van Meegeren and his mother made a visit to the Sultan of Serdang. This Sultan had a small harem of eleven wives, the youngest of whom was very beautiful. He introduced his nephew to this woman and instructed her to entertain his guest <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> Van Meegeren enjoyed the most idyllic moments with this young woman; it was an exotic way for a boy of 16 to be initiated into the secrets of love.|$|R
50|$|Hatsumi is Hazuki's adopted {{older sister}} and love interest. Hatsumi {{appears to be}} mute (though it is proven {{otherwise}} on several occasions) and communicates mostly through gestures and facial expressions. Despite being older, Hatsumi is much shorter than Hazuki. Although it seems that Hazuki's love is one-sided, episode seven shows that Hatsumi does have feelings for Hazuki {{and was trying to}} express herself <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> with the knowledge that she cannot stay beyond her sixteenth birthday (suggestions of this were shown along the way by her sending Hazuki anonymous love letters—later expressed in full and in words {{toward the end of the}} anime). In the first episode, Hatsumi disappears in a burst of green light ("sōma") at midnight on her sixteenth birthday, as Hazuki tries to steal a kiss in her sleep. The events that follow lead Hazuki to a mysterious library in another dimension, in which all the worlds are kept in books. Hazuki learns from the Library guardian, Lilith, that Hatsumi is only one of the forms of the previous guardian (Eve), and that Eve stays in different books for fun until she turns sixteen.|$|R
5000|$|Fiorenza {{sang with}} Maria Callas {{as early as}} 1957 in Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride, and many times later, until Callas' last Norma in Paris. The last {{performance}} of the latter was truncated when Callas' walked out right after their quintessential duet, [...] "Mira, o Norma." [...] Some claim that Cossotto intentionally sabotaged Callas by singing over her and holding high notes longer with the latter's voice (by that time, 1965) past its prime and in poor form. Others claim, in favor of Cossotto, that she encouraged Callas to sing <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and was quite cautious with her and tried to give her as much support as she could.Private recordings made at the time (and issued subsequently) are interpreted in both ways.Both Cossotto (in an interview, 2006) and Ivo Vinco (1982) said that Callas was a great friend of Cossotto, and invited her to sing Adalgisa to her Norma in the first place. On the other hand, Zeffirelli and older star mezzo Giulietta Simionato both took the accusers' side.This controversy is still being debated, particularly because {{the one who is}} closest to the truth; i.e., Callas herself, died in 1977.|$|R
2500|$|As a child, Elizabeth was the {{particular}} favorite of her father. She resembled him {{both physically and}} temperamentally. She was a bright girl, if not brilliant, but received only a desultory formal education. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education. He had a son (and grandson) {{from his first marriage}} to a noblewoman, and did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid and second wife might one day inherit the throne. Indeed, no woman had ever sat upon the throne of Russia yet. It was therefore left to Catherine to raise the girls <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but she was herself too uneducated to be able to superintend the formal education of her daughters. Elizabeth had a French governess and grew fluent in Italian, German and French. She was also an excellent dancer and rider. Like her father, Elizabeth was physically active and loved riding, hunting, sledging, skating, and gardening. From her earliest years, she delighted everyone with her extraordinary beauty and vivacity, and was regarded as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire. The wife of the British minister (ambassador) described Elizabeth as [...] "fair, with light brown hair, large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth and a pretty mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay and talks to everyone..." ...|$|E

60|$|She dressed {{herself with}} {{care in the}} morning, putting on her powder, her little touch of rouge, her one patch near the dimple of her cheek, her loose robe of violet velvet, and her casconet of pearls with all the solicitude of a warrior, who is bracing on his arms for a life and death contest. No news {{had come to her}} of the great event of the {{previous}} night, although the court already rang with it, for her haughtiness and her bitter tongue had left her without a friend or intimate.

6000|$|When she saw Grisell on finally departing for St. Albans, she was {{carrying}} her head a good deal higher {{on the strength of}} [...] "my Lord Earl's grace to her." [...] She hoped that her sweet Lady Grisell would remain here, <b>as</b> the <b>best</b> hap <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have in the most noble, excellent, and open-handed house in the world! Grisell's own wishes were not the same, for the great household was very bewildering--a strange change from her quietly-busy convent. The Countess was quiet enough, but dull and sickly, and chiefly occupied by her ailments. She seemed to be always thinking about leeches, wise friars, wonderful nuns, or even wizards and cunning women, and was much concerned that her husband absolutely forbade her consulting the witch of Spitalfields.|$|R
6000|$|The {{scene of}} the [...] "etude du soir" [...] was always the refectory, a much smaller {{apartment}} {{than any of the}} three classes or schoolrooms; for here none, save the boarders, were ever admitted, and these numbered only a score. Two lamps hung from the ceiling over the two tables; these were lit at dusk, and their kindling was the signal for school-books being set aside, a grave demeanour assumed, general silence enforced, and then commenced [...] "la lecture pieuse." [...] This said [...] "lecture pieuse" [...] was, I soon found, mainly designed as a wholesome mortification of the Intellect, a useful humiliation of the Reason; and such a dose for Common Sense as she might digest at her leisure, and thrive on <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>best</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R

When on Tuesday, Dick went towards the school to acquaint Fancy with the fact, {{it is difficult to}} say whether his own disappointment at being denied the sight of her triumphant debut as organist, was greater than his vexation that his pet should on this great occasion be deprived of the pleasure of his presence. However, the intelligence was communicated.

5000|$|Cydippe was {{the mother}} of Cleobis and Biton. Cydippe, a priestess of Hera, {{was on her way to}} a festival in the goddess' honor.

Cydippe was {{impressed}} with their devotion to her and asked Hera to give her children the best gift a god could give a person. Hera had the two brothers drop dead instantaneously <b>as</b> the <b>best</b> thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> give them was for them to die at their moment of highest devotion. This is Herodotus's account (Histories 1.31) of the story and it comes couched as advice from Solon the Athenian to Croesus as to who the most blessed people in history are.

Her uncle and Marquis Baldwin could have between them compelled her, as an orphan heiress, to marry whom they liked. But Torfrida had as yet bullied the Abbot and coaxed the Count successfully. Lances had been splintered, helmets split, and more than one life lost in her honor; but she had only, <b>as</b> the <b>best</b> safeguard <b>she</b> <b>could</b> devise, given some hint of encouragement to one Ascelin, a tall knight of St. Valeri, the most renowned bully of those parts, by bestowing on him a scrap of ribbon, and bidding him keep it against all comers. By this means she insured the personal chastisement of all other youths who dared to lift their eyes to her, while she by no means bound herself to her spadassin of St. Valeri. It was all very brutal, but so was the time; and what better could a poor lady do in days when no man's life or woman's honor was safe, unless--as too many were forced to do--she retired into a cloister, and got from the Church that peace which this world certainly could not give, and, happily, dared not take away? ...|$|R
