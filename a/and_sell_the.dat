5|$|Beginning in November 1895, {{artist and}} author Alfred Lambourne {{spent a year}} living on the remote Gunnison Island, where {{he wrote a book}} of musing and poetry, Our Inland Sea. From November 1895 to March 1896, he was alone. In March, a few guano sifters arrived to harvest <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> guano of the nesting birds as fertilizer. Lambourne {{included}} musings about these guano sifters in his work. Lambourne left the island early in the winter of 1896 along with the first group of guano sifters.|$|E
5|$|In the Summer of 1917, {{businessman}} R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works began purchasing Grapico syrup barrels from J. Grossman's Sons to bottle <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> Alabama {{soft drink}} market. In that same year, Laurel, Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company {{also became a}} wholesale customer of J. Grossman's Sons and began bottling and selling Grapico in Mississippi.

5|$|On 31 August 2010, Corinthians {{announced}} {{the construction of}} the stadium with an estimated cost of R$335million and an expected gross revenue of R$100million per year. The original plans allow for an expansion to 70,000 seats. The club expected to get financing from BNDES <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> naming rights for the stadium to pay for the construction costs. The main architect of the project was Aníbal Coutinho; he was assisted by Antônio Paulo Cordeiro from Coutinho, Diegues, Cordeiro (DDG), partnering with Werner Sobek, who rendered structural engineering services. The stadium was planned to be completed by March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National Carousel Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's closure, the Central Electricity Generating Board {{had planned}} to {{demolish}} the station <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> land for housing, {{but because of the}} building's then Grade II listed status, they had to pay the high-cost of preserving the building. In 1983 they held a competition for ideas on the redevelopment of the site. It was won by a consortium led by developer David Roche and which included John Broome, owner of Alton Towers Ltd. This consortium proposed an indoor theme park, with shops and restaurants. At an estimated cost of £35million, the scheme was risky and would require over 2million visitors a year to make any profit. The scheme received planning approval in May 1986 and the site was purchased by John Broome for £1.5million in 1987. Work on converting the site began the same year.|$|E
5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E

5|$|Placed on {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} State House, the bell was rung {{in the early years}} of {{independence}} on the Fourth of July and on Washington's Birthday, as well as on Election Day to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to their classes at nearby Philosophical Hall. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to Lancaster, it again rang to summon legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at Villanova University.|$|E
5|$|The Whopper Jr was created, by accident, in 1963 by Luis Arenas-Pérez (aka Luis Arenas), {{the only}} Latino in the Burger King Hall of Fame and {{president}} and CEO of Burger King in Puerto Rico. Upon {{the opening of}} the first Burger King restaurant in Carolina, Puerto Rico, the molds for the (standard) Whopper buns had not yet arrived to Puerto Rico from the United States mainland and thus there were no buns to make <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> company's flagship Whopper offering. Arenas opted for honoring the advertised opening date but using the much smaller regular hamburger buns locally available. The result was such a success that Burger King adopted it worldwide and called it the Whopper Jr.|$|E
5|$|To {{generate}} {{support for}} the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, {{who had worked for}} the Hull and Barnsley Railway. His task was to set up committees in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees. A large meeting of the working classes, attended by several local notables including the general secretaries of several trade unions, was held on 13November at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> property, and within a few years more buildings had gone up, {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
5|$|Daniel persuades Amy {{to return}} and she {{introduces}} Paul to her son Jimmy (Darcy Tadich). Paul and Jimmy bond, but when he buys Jimmy expensive presents, Amy returns them. Paul fires Kyle from the council's beautification project after he fails to reprimand a handyman for sexually harassing Amy. She convinces him to give Kyle his job back. Paul learns that Sheila {{had a crush on}} him, after Jimmy blackmails her. They later clear the air. Paul gives Amy a job as his executive assistant, but she quits after making a mistake which costs Lassiter's money. Paul proposes to Naomi and she accepts, but she soon has doubts. After an argument, she has a one-night stand with Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Paul forgives Naomi and they agree to call off their engagement. He then decides to get revenge on Josh by getting his good behaviour bond revoked by paying someone to plant illegal peptides in his bag. Naomi breaks up with Paul and leaves for a job overseas. Paul pays Jimmy's father to leave town, resulting in Jimmy not wanting to spend time with him. Paul plans to close Erinsborough High <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> land to Eden Hills Grammar, so he can push through a luxury housing development. Paul is blackmailed and his personal emails are sent to the media, resulting in him receiving death threats. He hires Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to be his bodyguard.
