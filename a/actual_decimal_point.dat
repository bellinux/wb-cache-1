[...] To determine the <b>actual</b> value, a <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> is placed {{after the first}} digit of the significand {{and the result is}} multiplied by [...] to give , or [...] In storing such a number, the base (10) need not be stored, since it will be the same for the entire range of supported numbers, and can thus be inferred.|$|R

50|$|The lattice {{technique}} {{can also}} be used to multiply decimal fractions. For example, to multiply 5.8 by 2.13, the process is the same as to multiply 58 by 213 as described in the preceding section. To find the position of the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in the final answer, one can draw a vertical line from the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in 5.8, and a horizontal line from the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in 2.13. The grid diagonal through the intersection of these two lines then determines the position of the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in the result.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> {{is written}} as [...] "," [...] (comma) and written and {{pronounced}} komma. The digits following the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> may be read individually or {{as a pair}} if there are only two. When dealing with monetary amounts (usually with two <b>decimals),</b> the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> is read as och, i.e. [...] "and": 3,50 (tre och femtio), 7,88 (sju och åttioåtta).|$|R
50|$|In English the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> was {{originally}} {{printed in the}} center of the line (0·002), but with the advent of the typewriter it was placed at the bottom of the line, so that a single key could be used as a full stop/period and as a <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> In many non-English languages a full-stop/period at the bottom of the line is used as a thousands separator with a comma being used as the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cast {{aluminium}} alloys use a {{four to five}} digit number with a <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> The digit in the hundreds place indicates the alloying elements, while the digit after the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> indicates the form (cast shape or ingot).|$|R
50|$|Write the {{original}} number in decimal form. The numbers are written {{similar to the}} long division algorithm, and, as in long division, the root will be written on the line above. Now separate the digits into pairs, starting from the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> and going both left and right. The <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> of the root will be above the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> of the square. One digit of the root will appear above each pair of digits of the square.|$|R
50|$|Where <b>decimal</b> <b>points</b> are assumed, {{they are}} leading <b>decimal</b> <b>points.</b> The last two symbols in Fields 10 and 11 {{of the first}} line give powers of 10 {{to apply to the}} {{preceding}} decimal. Thus, for example, Field 11 (-11606-4) translates to -0.11606E-4 (-0.11606×10−4).|$|R
5000|$|A <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> or comma may {{be present}} as an {{additional}} segment, or pair of segments; the comma (used for triple-digit groupings or as a decimal separator in many regions) is commonly formed by combining the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> with a closely 'attached' leftwards-descending arc-shaped segment.|$|R
50|$|Sports {{are ranked}} {{according}} to total possible scholarships (number of teams x number of scholarships per team). Scholarship numbers for head-count sports are indicated without a <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> Numbers for equivalency sports are indicated with a <b>decimal</b> <b>point,</b> with a trailing zero if needed.|$|R
25|$|Write the {{original}} number in decimal form. The numbers are written {{similar to the}} long division algorithm, and, as in long division, the root will be written on the line above. Now separate the digits into groups of digits equating to the root being taken, starting from the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> and going both left and right. The <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> of the root will be above the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> of the square. One digit of the root will appear above each group of digits of {{the original}} number.|$|R
2500|$|Punctuation {{varies from}} {{language}} to language. For example, French Braille uses [...] for its question mark and swaps the quotation marks and parentheses (to [...] and [...] ); {{it uses the}} period (...) for the <b>decimal</b> <b>point,</b> as in print, and the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> (...) to mark capitalization.|$|R
25|$|To {{change a}} decimal to a fraction, {{write in the}} {{denominator}} a 1 followed by as many zeroes as there are digits {{to the right of}} the <b>decimal</b> <b>point,</b> and write in the numerator all the digits in the original decimal, omitting the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> Thus 12.3456 = 123456/10000.|$|R
50|$|For real numbers {{written in}} decimal notation, a {{slightly}} different variant of the lexicographical order is used: the parts on {{the left of the}} <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> are compared as before; if they are equal, the parts at the right of the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> are compared with the lexicographical order.|$|R
50|$|The user {{determines the}} {{location}} of the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in the result, based on mental estimation. Scientific notation is used to track the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.|$|R
5000|$|In applied mathematics, {{a number}} is {{normalized}} {{when it is}} written in scientific notation with one nonzero decimal digit before the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> Thus, a real number when written out in normalized scientific notation is as follows:where n is an integer, [...] , ... are the digits of the number in base 10, and [...] is not zero. That is, its leading digit (i.e. leftmost) is not zero and is followed by the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> This is the standard form of scientific notation. An alternative style is to have the first non-zero digit after the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

50|$|The decimal {{separator}} also follows local countries' standards. For instance, the United Kingdom often uses an interpunct as the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> on price stickers (e.g., £5·52), although not in print. Commas (e.g. €5,00) or <b>decimal</b> <b>points</b> (e.g. $50.00) are common separators {{used in other}} countries. See {{decimal separator}} for information on international standards.|$|R
