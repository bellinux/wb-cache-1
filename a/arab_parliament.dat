In April 2006, amid mounting criticism of ineffective leadership and favoritism by Kurdish and Sunni <b>Arab</b> politicians in <b>parliament,</b> al-Jaafari was forced from power. On 22 April 2006, following close U.S. {{involvement in the}} selection of a new prime minister, al-Maliki's name arose from the four that had been interviewed by the CIA on their connections to Iran (the others including Hussein al-Shahristani and Ali al-Adeeb). United States Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad said that [...] "Maliki's reputation is as someone who is independent of Iran." [...] Khalilzad also maintained that Iran [...] "pressured everyone for Jaafari to stay". [...] However, al-Maliki was the preferred candidate of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, and it was Soleimani who brokered the deal between senior Shiite and Kurdish leaders that led to his election as Prime Minister.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} on peace and state-building highlights {{the need for}} women’s participation in post-conflict reconstruction to move from war and displacement, towards stability and future independence. This thesis analyses this ‘gender mainstreaming’ approach to statebuilding using {{the example of the}} Saharawi Popular Liberation Front (Polisario) and its long term struggle for independence, focussing specifically on gender representation in Polisario representatives abroad. Both the National Union of Saharawi Women and the Polisario liberation movement have been praised by academics and institutions alike for their achievements in gender mainstreaming. Despite living as refugees in Algeria, Saharawi women have led the camps’ administration for more than thirty years, and today constitute more than 35 % of the Saharawi <b>Arab</b> Democratic Republic’s <b>parliament.</b> I argue that while women’s participation in refugee camp administration has always been a feature, a substantial female representation in high-level political office and in the state-in-waiting’s foreign relations is relatively new to the Polisario. Gender mainstreaming can thus be tested against the historical practice of the Polisario and the broader campaign to win international acceptance and support for independence for Western Sahara. In a situation of political stalemate, where UN sponsored diplomatic discussions between the Polisario and Morocco on a peaceful solution for Western Sahara have been so-far inconclusive, the job done by Saharawi representatives abroad in lobbying host countries to their cause is invaluable. Yet exactly how has the presence of women as foreign representatives assisted the political cause of Western Sahara? This study draws on the work of Third World and Islamic feminist theorists in order to interpret gender relations in state-building with the Muslim Saharawi refugees, arguing that Saharawi were implementing gender mainstreaming approaches to social, political and administrative life in exile long before the international community began to promote a discourse of gender and statebuilding. A critical ethnographic approach is used in a bid to understand the interplay between gender and power, and analyse the relationship between Saharawi political representatives abroad and their supporters...|$|R

Unlike the two other communist factions, the new communist current was not part of the National Progressive Front which brought together the ruling Ba'ath Party and the other [...] "legal" [...] parties.

The issue was not raised in any significant way during the November/December 2006 elections, despite an awareness campaign by the Supreme Council for Women in the fall of 2005 and seminars by civil society groups, which highlighted the need for a family law. This was followed by public debate and rallies both in favor of and against such a law. During the reporting period, members of the Awali Community Church visited Christian prison inmates approximately monthly, to provide clothing and Christian literature and messages from their home. Members of other churches also made periodic visits to Christian prison inmates.|$|E
