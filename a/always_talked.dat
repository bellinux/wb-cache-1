500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about it, if you go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." [...] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac. In concluding her post, she wrote, [...] "Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alvin Toffler {{was born}} on October 4, 1928, in New York City, and raised in Brooklyn. He {{was the son of}} Rose (Albaum) and Sam Toffler, a furrier, both Jewish {{immigrants}} from Poland. He had one younger sister. He was inspired to become a writer at the age of 7 by his aunt and uncle, who lived with the Tofflers. [...] "They were Depression-era literary intellectuals," [...] Toffler said, [...] "and they <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about exciting ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Cruyff became {{synonymous with}} the playing style of [...] "Total Football". It is a system where a player who moves out of his {{position}} is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this fluid system, no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field [...] "conductor". Space {{and the creation of}} it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff, who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: [...] "We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time? That is where we have to play the ball. Every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Upvenue, Tobin Esperance said of Time for Annihilation that [...] "We put out five major label, full-length records, and we were transitioning from a major label, going independent, {{and we wanted to}} do something different [...] we'd <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about doing a live record, and it turned into 'let's add a couple of bonus songs' [...] and now it's half live, half new songs and it's kind of the past and present of Papa Roach, and I think it's a good representation and a good reminder of what this band's about, [...] and it gives you a look at where our sound can go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parker later {{spoke of}} how his musical {{relationship}} with Canyons came to be: [...] "They used to run a label which Tame Impala used to sort of be on. We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons and that was really cool, it was a really casual relationship. We <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about releasing things but we never got round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually got anything pressed until we had signed with Modular and then we went back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March {{the escort}} in Via Fani was not {{carrying}} weapons, which were instead {{kept in the}} trunks of the cars; Eleonora Chiavarelli (Aldo Moro's wife) said, during the trial, that the weapons were in the trunks because [...] "these people didn't {{know how to use}} weapons because they never did shooting practice, they hadn't habit to handle them, so that the guns were in the trunk. Leonardi <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about it. [...] "These people shouldn't have weapons they don't know how to use. They should know how to use them. They should carry them properly. Keep them within reach. The radio should be operational, but it doesn't work." [...] For months it had been going on like this. Marshal Leonardi and lance corporal Ricci did not expect an ambush, because their weapons were placed in the bag and one of the two holsters was even in a plastic liner." [...] The last sentence was denied by the widow of Marshal Leonardi, stating that her husband [...] "recently went around armed because he had noticed that a car was following him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Night of the Living Drums, the band's fourth studio album, was {{initially}} set for release in June 2010, {{according to the}} band's official website. However it was pushed back for undisclosed reasons, then in December it was revealed the band had left Sony Music, after the label had refused to release the album. On 11 November 2011 Rogue Traders finally released Night of the Living Drums, after they had re-signed to Sony. It was released as part of The Sound of Drums which is a double album that includes a compilation disc, The Greatest Hits, and the studio recording, Night of the Living Drums. Ash described The Sound of Drums conception, [...] "he catalyst was when we realised we were coming up to the band's 10-year anniversary. We'd <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about how much fun {{it would be to}} do a greatest hits one day, and we struck on the idea of doing a record that combined the two. I have to give credit to Sony, because they changed their minds about us – we brought this idea back to them and they went for it".|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the {{possibility}} of a sequel, Vega has been quoted as saying: [...] "From the very, very beginning, we <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> about a prequel or a sequel to this film. And it's hard, because as of right now, we all want to do it, but, you know, it didn't really do as we hoped. We didn't really have a lot of support. But we're hoping that the fans will come back, and it will be an underground cult classic that will grow, and that will eventually spark us to do another." [...] Bousman also indicated interest, stating; [...] "I would love to follow up Repo and finish the story, because it was conceived as a three-part movie. But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV." [...] It was additionally expected that Hilton would return in her role as Amber Sweet. However, in a video posted on YouTube, it was revealed that they [...] "no longer control {{the answer to the question}} [...] " [...] since they no longer have ownership of the franchise, thus driving Bousman and Zdunich to make The Devil's Carnival.|$|E
