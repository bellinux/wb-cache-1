5|$|Inside of his chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a popular song whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

5|$|Seeing the {{positive}} reception by the female audience, Glenda tries to convince Deke {{to join the}} Tex Warner Show. Driving in Deke's hotrod, she tells him about his potential. Not willing to leave his first steady job in a year, he rejects the offer, but Glenda asks him to think about it. Upon returning to town, Glenda calls the Highway Beverage Company, after which she and Tex quit the Tallman campaign {{to return to their}} own roadshow. Later that night, Deke is provoked at a restaurant by the boyfriend of one of his fans, who wants to hear him sing a song. After singing to <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> from the jukebox, he starts a fight with him. He is later exonerated by the police.|$|E
5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling <b>a</b> <b>tune.</b> After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. <b>A</b> <b>tune</b> is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>tuning</b> wrench (also called <b>a</b> <b>tuning</b> lever or <b>tuning</b> hammer) is <b>a</b> {{specialized}} {{socket wrench}} used to tune string instruments {{such as the}} piano, harp, and hammer dulcimer, that have strings wrapped around tuning pins. Other string instruments do not require <b>a</b> <b>tuning</b> wrench because their tuning pins or pegs come with handles (as with the violin), or geared tuning machines (as with the guitar or banjo).|$|R

25|$|Build-a-Tune—The {{orchestra}} played <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> {{starting with}} minimal instrumentation and gradually added more {{until it became}} a full orchestral arrangement. Whoever named more tunes out of five received 10 points and a prize package. If both players were tied, each received five points and the prizes. This game was played only on the short-lived 1977 daytime version.|$|E
25|$|Tonguing: Tonguing is used {{sparingly}} as a {{means of}} emphasizing certain notes, such as the first note in <b>a</b> <b>tune.</b> Tin whistle players usually do not tongue most notes. To tongue a note a player briefly touches their tongue {{to the front of the}} roof of the mouth at the start of the note (as if articulating a 't'), creating a percussive attack.|$|E
25|$|The ambient {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by Paul Wickens, {{who is also a}} member of Paul McCartney's touring band. Adams and Wickens were acquainted from school, but lost touch until Adams saw him performing with McCartney. Adams also wrote additional soundtrack himself, including the music in the Music Room puzzle, which was based on <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> he had written on the guitar years earlier.|$|E

25|$|Players {{traditionally}} learn old-time {{music by}} ear; even musicians who can read music. A broad selection of written music does exist, although {{many believe that}} the style of old-time music cannot be practically notated by written music. This is in part {{because there are many}} regional and local variations to old-time tunes, and because some of the most noted players often improvised and wouldn't play <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> exactly the same way every time.|$|E
25|$|On the two last records Stubø was on {{the label}} Cadence Jazz Records. First came the LP Rhythm'a'ning (Cadence Jazz Records, 1986), live in Tromsø, with Krister Andersson, Lars Sjösten, Terje Venaas and Egil Johansen, (Cadence Jazz Records, 1986). This is a stylish and very {{consistent}} release, with many tunes by John Coltrane. The end of <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> (Cadence Jazz Records, 1988), with Art Farmer, Doug Raney, Ivar Antonsen, Jesper Lundgaard and Ole Jacob Hansen, {{marked the end of}} an extraordinary career.|$|E
25|$|The lyrics {{were written}} by Frank Lebby Stanton and {{published}} in his Songs of the Soil (1894). The tune was composed by Carrie Jacobs-Bond and published as part of Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose in 1901. Harry T. Burleigh also composed <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> (copyrighted in 1906), but it never approached {{the popularity of the}} Jacobs-Bond tune. Although Stanton originally wrote the lyrics in dialect ("Jes' a-wearyin' fer you") for a column in the Atlanta Constitution, the song has generally circulated with the more mainstreamed diction of the Jacobs-Bond version.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{application}} for class-C amplifiers is in RF transmitters operating {{at a single}} fixed carrier frequency, where the distortion is controlled by <b>a</b> <b>tuned</b> load on the amplifier. The input signal is used to switch the active device causing pulses of current to flow through <b>a</b> <b>tuned</b> circuit forming part of the load.|$|R

25|$|Two {{weeks after}} Michigan, the band {{performed}} in Allentown. The following week, for Homecoming, the school held a two-hour tribute in the Mullins Center for Parks before that days football game. For halftime, an alumni band composed of almost 1,000 past members performed first <b>a</b> <b>tune,</b> {{and then a}} combined performance with current members of the band. In all, almost 1,300 members past and present were on the field for this performance. The next week the band attended an away game versus the University of New Hampshire at Gillette Stadium for the Colonial Clash. The band performed at MICCA Finals in Lowell, MA the day after.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} of acquired amusia {{are much more}} variable than those of congenital amusia and {{are determined by the}} location and nature of the lesion. Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).|$|E
25|$|In 1711, Blackmore {{produced}} The Nature of Man, a physiological/theological poem {{on climate}} and character (with the English climate being the best). This was <b>a</b> <b>tune</b> up for Creation: A Philosophical Poem in 1712, which was praised by John Dennis, Joseph Addison, and, later, Samuel Johnson, for its Miltonic tone. It ran to 16 editions, {{and of all}} his epics it was best received. Its design was to refute the atheism of Vanini, Hobbes and (supposedly) Spinoza, and to unfold the intellectual philosophy of Locke. Johnson {{thought that it would}} be the sole memory of Blackmore, and Dennis said that it was the English De Rerum Natura, but with infinitely better reasoning.|$|E
