5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E

On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E

The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed.

The United Irishmen planned to take Dublin in a street rising in 1798, but their leaders were arrested and the city occupied by a large British military presence shortly before the rebels could assemble. There was some local fighting in the city's outskirts – such as Rathfarnham, but the city itself remained firmly under control during the 1798 rebellion.|$|E
25|$|To {{prove that}} the set of real {{algebraic}} numbers is countable, define {{the height of a}} polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients as: n−1+|a0|+|a1|+…+|a'n|, where a0, a1, …, an are the coefficients of the polynomial. Order the polynomials by their height, and order the real roots of polynomials of the same height by numeric order. Since there are only a finite number of roots of polynomials of a given height, these orderings put the real algebraic numbers into a sequence. Cantor went <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> produced a sequence in which each real algebraic number appears just once.
