Following <b>a</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat sinks, the degasser/condenser relief valves (DCRV) become the sole means available for the depressurization of the primary heat transport system. If {{a nuclear power plant}} has <b>a</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> heat sinks accident, high-temperature steam and differential pressure between the primary heat transport system (PHTS) and the steam generator (SG) secondary side can cause a SG tube creep rupture. To protect the PHTS during <b>a</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat sinks accident, a sufficient depressurization capability of the degasser/condenser relief valve and the SG tube integrity is very important. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the discharge through these valves is necessary {{to assess the impact of}} the PHTS overprotection and the SG tube integrity of the primary circuit. This paper describes the analysis of DCRV discharge capacity and the SG tube integrity under <b>a</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat sink using the CATHENA code. It was found that the DCRV's discharge capacity is enough to protect the overpressure in the PHTS, and the SG tube integrity is maintained in <b>a</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat accident...|$|R
