Remedy noted that it is not Alan Wake 2 <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> it downloadable content. At the time, the company gave a Fall 2011 estimate for the release. In November 2011 it was announced that the new Alan Wake title will be available on the Xbox Live Arcade service, and will be revealed at the Spike Video Game Awards on 10 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E
5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

25|$|Italian {{historian}} and novelist Valerio Massimo Manfredi {{claimed that the}} movie was almost a plagiarism of his 2002 novel The Last Legion, due to several similarities between the two works. These similarities include the reuse of some tropes and happenings present in the book and, especially, the attempt to give historical reliability to the main characters {{with the concept of}} King Arthur having Roman origins. Indeed, the events of the movie suggest a theory that is largely different from the one on which Manfredi's novel is based, in which Artorius Castus isn't even mentioned, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> the Sarmatian auxiliary army. According to Manfredi, King Arthurs release and its commercial failure were among the main causes of the problems related to the movie adaptation of his novel, that was in development hell until its release in 2007.|$|E

NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata stated [...] "The survey doesn't recognize the psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on American Indian and Alaska Natives. It is not respectful to {{who we are as}} Native people. This poll still doesn't make it right." [...] The Native American Journalists Association issued a statement calling the publication of the poll, and the reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical.

J. oxycedrus is not known to grow in Egypt, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> Juniperus excelsa, which was found along with J. oxycedrus in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The berries imported into Egypt may have come from Greece; the Greeks record using juniper berries as a medicine long before mentioning their use in food. The Greeks used the berries in many of their Olympics events because of their belief that the berries increased physical stamina in athletes. The Romans used juniper berries as a cheap domestically produced substitute for the expensive black pepper and long pepper imported from India. It was also used as an adulterant, as reported in Pliny the Elder's Natural History: [...] "Pepper is adulterated with juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellous degree, of assuming the pungency of pepper." [...] Pliny also incorrectly asserted that black pepper grew on trees that were [...] "very similar in appearance to our junipers".|$|E

But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The way he has used the {{flashback}} as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a jiffy is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers." [...] B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, [...] "Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart-touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film." [...] He added, [...] "After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain", and rated the film 3 out of 5.|$|E

However, don't {{make the mistake of}} thinking this video is by any means straightforward‚Äî it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. <b>And</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyonc√© snap her gum and shake her hips and grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red." [...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way of}} chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes."

500|$|The {{interaction}} between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics.

[...] She continued: [...] "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching The Proposal won't be able to resist their charms, even {{when some of the}} plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness." [...] Betsey Sharkley of the Los Angeles Times felt that their relationship was a [...] "cheeky update of The Taming of the Shrew." [...] She opined, [...] "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn." [...] Giving it a one out of five stars, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the {{interaction between}} Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks as if they have never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Cineaste asked a {{range of}} {{academics}} for their definition of a cult film. [...] Several people defined cult films primarily {{in terms of their}} opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a transgressive element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films. [...] Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements. [...] Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior. [...] Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria. [...] Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in structuration, where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> prioritized. Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while Jonathan Rosenbaum rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword. [...] Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term. [...] That cult films can have opposing qualities ‚Äì such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro ‚Äì helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident. [...] This ambiguity leads critics of postmodernism to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or metanarratives. [...] These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.|$|E

500|$|Samus' reveal in the {{original}} Metroid, which UGO.com called {{the original}} [...] "jaw-dropping moment" [...] in gaming, was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008. The Irish Times found it refreshing {{to learn that the}} series' protagonist, who is [...] "well disguised under the suit of heavy armour", is female, but Rupert Goodwins of The Independent wrote that the [...] "Transformer-like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede; it's hardly a breakthrough for feminism." [...] According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections, Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video game character ever, a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development, which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." [...] That same year, however, an article in the Toronto Star retorted that the [...] "sexual politics" [...] surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop, arguing that the original [...] "big crazy shock to the gaming public" [...] was [...] "some seriously misspent energy" [...] as she [...] "is not a woman {{for the benefit of the}} sweaty/excited crowd, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> she a standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights. She is a supremely talented action figure, and in the closeups on her helmet you can kind of see that she wears mascara, but that is all." [...] UGO.com included Samus' one-piece bathing swimsuit on the list of the best alternate costumes and IGN chose [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] by Aerosmith as Samus' theme song because she [...] "spends her time running around in a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later." [...] Featuring her in their 2004 list of [...] "top ten forces of good" [...] (one section on their list of top 50 [...] "retro" [...] game characters), Retro Gamer opined she has remained [...] "a distinct female character, not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers, which is more than can be said for some." ...|$|E
