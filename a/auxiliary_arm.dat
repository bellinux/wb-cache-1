There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new <b>auxiliary</b> <b>arm</b> (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

From 1915, soldiers on both sides routinely sharpened the edges of entrenching shovels for use as weapons.|$|R
2500|$|The third {{board was}} the Morrow Board, a [...] "blue ribbon" [...] panel convened by President Coolidge in September 1925 {{to make a}} general inquiry into U.S. aviation. Headed by an {{investment}} banker and personal friend of Coolidge's, Dwight Morrow, the board {{was made up of}} a federal judge, the head of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, former military officers now in industry, and the wartime head of the Board of Aircraft Production. The actual purpose of the Morrow Board was to minimize the political impact of the Mitchell trial, and Coolidge directed that it issue its findings by the end of November, to pre-empt the findings of not only the military court but also of the Lampert Committee that might be contrary to the Morrow Board. Its report was released on December 3. The major result of the Morrow Board was to maintain the status quo. It also made the recommendation, adopted in 1926, that the Air Service be renamed the Air Corps, but in doing so Congress denied it the autonomy enjoyed by the Marine Corps within the Navy Department, and thus the change was only cosmetic and the Air Corps remained as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>arm</b> to the ground forces.|$|E

A motor can turn the arms to move the auxiliary wheels from a stowed position about halfway between the front and rear wheels and above the ground, to a second position against the ground to stabilize the vehicle. The arms can be turned more than 180. degree. to move the auxiliary wheels in front of the front primary wheels to help climb an embankment. The primary wheels can be mounted at the end of primary arms, so when the primary arms are turned they not only move the primary front wheels but also the inner ends of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>arms...</b>|$|R

After the fall of Singapore in 1942, the Choys set up a canteen at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, after all the patients and doctors had been moved from the Miyako Hospital (former Woodbridge Hospital), where they soon started a regular ambulance run for British civilian internees. The couple helped prisoners-of-war interned in Changi Prison by passing to them cash and parcels containing fresh clothing, medicine and letters during their deliveries. They incurred further risk by sending in radio parts for hidden receivers until the Japanese crackdown following Operation Jaywick.|$|E

5000|$|United Hatzalah and MDA are {{the nationally}} {{recognized}} EMS organizations of the State of Israel. United Hatzalah consists of 3,200 volunteers, that provide completely free services. The United Hatzalah volunteers utilize various vehicles, including ambucycles, e-bikes, ambuboats, and etc. {{to reach the}} patients in their most vital time of need. They are Israel's first on the scene, first responders. Across Israel, United Hatzalah has a response time of 3 minutes, and in Jerusalem a response time of 90 seconds. United Hatzalah is known not only for their fast response times, but also their inclusiveness. United Haztalah has hundreds of Arab, Christian and Druze volunteers, coming together {{for the sake of}} saving lives. United Hatzalah offers many services, including EMS response, the world's first Psychotrauma Unit which treats emotional injuries at the scene of traumatic incidents, and the Ten Kavod program, which provides free weekly medical care to at risk seniors, including survivors of the Holocaust. MDA consists of approx. 14,000 volunteers and 1850 employee Doctors, Paramedics, EMTs and First Aiders. The organization operates 95 stations with a fleet of over 728 ambulances. The majority of the fleet consists of Basic Life Support (BLS) ambulances.

In an unusual feature, armored ambulances are not uncommon nationwide. The system is highly dependent on volunteers, many of whom are from outside of Israel. As a recognized national aid society, according to the Geneva Conventions MDA may become an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>arm</b> of the Israeli Defence Force during wartime. Most major stations also include special units for responding to mass-casualty incidents like natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The system, for the most part, used to conform to the Franco-German (as opposed to the Anglo-American) [...] model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies was not uncommon. As of 2015 MDA no longer employs physicians on its ALS/MICU ambulances, volunteer physicians may still be encountered in the field but employee physicians' main task is to provide on-line medical support through a special hot-line. In addition, emergency ambulance service is supplemented by a variety of private carriers who are tasked with interfacility transfers only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} using a heuristic policy to im-prove the value approximation by the Upper Confidence Bound applied in Trees (UCT) algorithm in non-adversarial settings such as planning with large-state space Markov Decision Processes. Current improvements to UCT focus on either changing the action selection formula at the in-ternal nodes or the rollout policy at the leaf nodes of the search tree. In this work, we propose to add an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>arm</b> {{to each of the}} internal nodes, and always use the heuristic policy to roll out simulations at the auxiliary arms. The method aims to get fast convergence to optimal val-ues at states where the heuristic policy is optimal, while retaining similar approximation as the original UCT in other states. We show that boot-strapping with the proposed method in the new algorithm, UCT-Aux, performs better compared to the original UCT algorithm and its vari-ants in two benchmark experiment settings. We also examine conditions under which UCT-Aux works well. ...|$|E
