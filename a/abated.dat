5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be <b>abated</b> by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism <b>abated</b> when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A {{new generation of}} Norwegian architects educated in Sweden {{took the lead in}} developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a distinctly Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Dennis spanned twenty-two days, beginning with its inception as a tropical wave over Africa on June26, 2005, and terminating with its dissipation on July18 over the Great Lakes of North America. The incipient wave that became Dennis emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on June29 and moved briskly to the west. Dry air initially inhibited development, though once this <b>abated</b> the wave {{was able to}} consolidate into a tropical depression on July4. The depression soon crossed Grenada before entering the Caribbean Sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, fueled intensification. Turning west-northwest, the system achieved tropical storm status on July5 and hurricane status the following day.|$|E
5|$|While located off the New Jersey coast, {{the storm}} stopped {{strengthening}} and slowly moved northward. The center was situated near central Long Island at 2100 UTC. Across eastern Long Island {{and parts of}} eastern New England, snow mixed with and, in some cases, changed over to rain. The surface low had moved into eastern Connecticut by early on December 31. As it continued to head northeastward, a new center of low pressure developed near Boston and moved towards coastal Maine. The storm system had <b>abated</b> by January 1.|$|E

5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend <b>abated</b> because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E
5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions <b>abated</b> shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. With wind shear no longer impinging on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E
5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved slowly to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions <b>abated.</b> As a result, Erica began to gain some signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E

5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed {{one another in the}} dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to tow Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not <b>abated.</b> When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and broke her tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought <b>abated</b> in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Blanca was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in Baja California in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this <b>abated,</b> the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.|$|E

The tendency of the public generally gives the drug <b>abate</b> powder to kill mosquito larvae, in addition to wear insect repellent to kill adult mosquitoes, but led to a heavy reliance on chemical drugs and cause resistance in mosquitoes. The content of <b>abate</b> that kill mosquito larvae are temephos, the organic phosphate compound similar to alkaloids in plants ciplukan (Physalis angulata L). The purpose of the study: knowing the effect of ciplukan plant body parts (leaves and stems) on the growth of mosquito larvae; determine the concentration of plant extracts cipukan that affect the growth of mosquito larvae; study in agribusiness opportunities ciplukan plants as natural larvicidal. Methods: perform laboratory experiments. Conclusion: the alkaloid content exist on the leaves. The mean mortality mosquito larvae in the first 24 hours, so most effectively used as a natural larvicidal. Plants ciplukan likely replace <b>abate</b> because it contains alkaloids greater than <b>abate.</b> Ciplukan likely <b>abate</b> plants as natural because they are cheap compared to <b>abate.</b> Residue levels are smaller than <b>abate,</b> because phosphate is contained in the alkaloid readily biodegradable in the body. ...|$|R
