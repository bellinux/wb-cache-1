25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if <b>a</b> <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{excessive}} service load, inappropriate operating conditions or simply {{end of life}} fatigue, damage can occur in gears. When a fault, either distributed or localised, is incurred by gears, the stiffness and consequently vibration characteristics of the damaged tooth will change.
