5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme {{example of this is}} the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and <b>a</b> <b>plump,</b> rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E
5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is <b>a</b> <b>plump,</b> juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

5|$|Thus the FG01 did not promise much {{in terms}} of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor {{aerodynamic}} performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had <b>a</b> <b>plump</b> nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a manual gearbox in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a distinctive yellow-and-blue colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year. The precise hue of each colour was chosen {{as a tribute to}} Ayrton Senna, who had been killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix; the cars were liveried in identical shades to those used on the Brazilian's helmet design.|$|E
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} (Uratelornis chimaera) is {{a species of}} bird in the ground roller family Brachypteraciidae, placed in the {{monotypic}} genus Uratelornis. Endemic to arid spiny forests near the coast in southwestern Madagascar, this ground roller occurs at extremely low population densities throughout its habitat. This species requires shade and a deep layer of leaves on the ground, and it is absent from parts of the spiny forest lacking these features. It has no recognized subspecies, and its closest relative is the scaly ground roller. The long-tailed ground roller is the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism (differences in plumage or size between sexes). It is a medium-sized bird with <b>a</b> <b>plump</b> silhouette and a long tail. The upperparts are dark brown with black streaks while the underparts are light gray. The white throat is framed by black malar stripes and a black breastband, and a white stripe is present {{at the base of}} the bill. Sky-blue feathers are visible at the edge of the wings and the tail. Calls are rarely made outside the breeding season, though multiple courtship calls are made.|$|E

50|$|This moth is an {{inhabitant}} of coniferous woodland. The adults fly in May and June, sometimes later (up to August or so) in {{the north}} of the range. Their wingspan is 34-40 mm. This is a variable species with strong sexual dimorphism, always conspicuous in the antennae which are combed in the males and plain in the females. Females, particularly when filled with ripe eggs, also have <b>a</b> <b>plumper</b> abdomen.|$|R
25|$|The {{bandicoots}} and bilbiesorder Peramelemorphiaare marsupial omnivores. There {{are seven}} species in Australia, {{most of which}} are endangered. These small creatures share several characteristic physical features: <b>a</b> <b>plump,</b> arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, large upright ears, long, thin legs, and a thin tail. The evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, because they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.|$|E
25|$|Bird skin parka (tamacenaq in Yup'ik) {{made from}} skins of birds of the Alcidae, Anatidae, Gaviidae, and Laridae families. Bird skins make {{very good and}} warm parkas. Thick bird skin parkas were ideal winter wear but were also used during cold weather in summer. Yupik (Yup'ik, Siberian Yupik, Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq) and Inuit (Inupiaq) Eskimo seamstresses had {{regional}} variations in bird skin preparation techniques and bird skin parka styles and bird skin clothing-production techniques. Bird skin parkas are rarely made today and the skill is quickly disappearing among skin sewers in their region. During the 19th century, many Yup'iks along the coast between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers wore bird skins. Every year, one could afford to make a bird skin parka because birds returned in such abundance. <b>A</b> <b>plump</b> Yup'ik baby trussed up in eider skin smiled from a warm, dry, cushioned world.|$|E

Alternatively, Epalzeorhynchos might be considered <b>a</b> <b>plumper</b> version of Crossocheilus, which includes the well-known Siamese algae eater (C. siamensis) and is a very close relative. Their coloration is also reminiscent of some Crossocheilus, or of the Mekong loaches (Yasuhikotakia), depending on the particular Epalzeorhynchos species.|$|R

500|$|The Lānai hookbill was <b>a</b> <b>plump,</b> {{medium-sized}} bird. It had greenish olive upperparts {{and pale}} whitish yellow underparts, {{as well as}} a yellow or white superciliary line. The chin and throat were white. The wings' secondaries had a distinctive and conspicuous white wing patch. Due to the subdued colors of the sole specimen, it is believed that it was a female, suggesting that the male would have had a brighter plumage, especially in the superciliary line. The eyes, which were large for a bird of the hookbill's size, were dark brown and the muscular legs were gray with yellow toepads. The bird was about [...] in length, and the weight is unknown.|$|E

Possesses {{one of the most}} unorthodox 'axe' solos known to mankind." [...] The style of the song was compared to that of Queen by Rolling Stones Mark Kemp, while other critics, including David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, Jon Lusk of the BBC and Simon Williams of NME wrote about its similarity to Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody". Williams described the song as being [...] "not unlike 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being played backwards by a bunch of Vietnam vets high on Kings Cross-quality crack". Kemp praised the song's mix of acoustic and electronic instrumentation, which he believed were melded to produce [...] "complex tempo changes, touches of dissonance, ancient choral music and a King Crimson-like melodic structure". Meanwhile Browne wrote of [...] "celestial call-and-response vocal passages, dynamically varied sections, and Thom Yorke's high-voiced bleat". The A.V. Club called the song unforgettable and an [...] "amazing epic single".|$|E
500|$|Canning {{was born}} on 17September 1734 in the City of London, the eldest of five {{surviving}} children born to William (a carpenter) and Elizabeth Canning. [...] The family lived in two rooms in Aldermanbury Postern (a northern extension of Aldermanbury that formerly ran from a postern gate on London Wall to Fore Street; it no longer exists) in London. Aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood. [...] Canning was born into poverty. Her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two-room property with James Lord, an apprentice. [...] Lord occupied the building's front room, while Canning's family lived in the back room. [...] Her schooling was limited to {{only a few months}} at a writing school, and aged 15or16 she worked as a maidservant in the household of nearby publican John Wintlebury, who considered her an honest but shy girl. [...] From October 1752 she lived at the neighbouring home of a carpenter Edward Lyon, who shared Wintlebury's opinion of the young maidservant. Canning was described as <b>a</b> <b>plump</b> 18-year-old, about [...] tall with a face pitted by smallpox, a long, straight nose, and wide-set eyes.|$|E

500|$|The Lānai hookbill (Dysmorodrepanis munroi) is an {{extinct species}} of Hawaiian honeycreeper. It was endemic {{to the island}} of Lānai in Hawaii, and was last seen in the southwestern part of the island. George C. Munro {{collected}} the only known specimen of this species in 1913, which is housed in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu, and saw the species only twice more, once in 1916 and for a final time in 1918. No other sightings have been reported. They inhabited montane dry forests dominated by akoko (Euphorbia species) and ōpuhe (Urera glabra). The Lānai hookbill was [...] monotypic within the genus Dysmorodrepanis and had no known subspecies. Its closest relative {{is believed to be}} the ōū, and some early authors suggested that the Lānai hookbill was merely a deformed ōū.
