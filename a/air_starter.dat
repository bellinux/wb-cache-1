5000|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft and large military transport airplanes usually use {{what is called}} an auxiliary power unit (APU). It is normally a small gas turbine. Thus, {{one could say that}} using such an APU is using a small gas turbine to start a larger one. Low pressure (...) , high volume air from the compressor section of the APU is bled off through a system of pipes to the engines where it is directed into the starting system. This bleed air is directed into a mechanism to start the engine turning and begin pulling in <b>air.</b> The <b>starter</b> is usually an air turbine type, similar to the cartridge starter, but uses the APU's bleed air instead of the burning gases of the propellant cartridge. Most cart starters can also use APU air to turn them. When the rotating speed of the engine is sufficient to pull in enough air to support combustion, fuel is introduced and ignited. Once the engine ignites and reaches idle speed, the bleed air and ignition systems are shut off.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerospace system {{requirements}} {{over the last}} decade have continued to evolve toward higher levels of performance at lower cost, incurring a major challenge for system developers; how to balance conflicting performance and cost requirements and understand their impact on performance margins as well as the manufacturability characteristics of the design. This paper presents results of a case study performed on an aerospace <b>air</b> turbine <b>starter</b> system in which a top-level systems engineering methodology has been developed to help understand the impact that customer requirements and design decisions have on manufacturing trade space constraints. One of the major findings of this case study is that incremental increases in performance requirements can drive step change increases in manufacturing cost due to discontinuities in the material and process trade space, i. e. using titanium versus aluminum to meet temperature requirements or having to use investment versus sand castings to meet minimum thickness and tolerance requirements. Internally developed quantitative producibility analysis tools are also used to characterize the complexity and Design for Manufacturability (DFM) characteristics of the “similar to” baseline design to identify producibility improvement opportunities for the new design as part of the proposed systems engineering process to mitigate design reuse risks...|$|R

Because of salinity, the material can present phytotoxic levels of sodium and potassium. Thereby several washes in fresh water and a buffering treatment (in which calcium nitrate (CaNO 3) is added to leach out and remove any excess sodium and potassium from the material). They were kept in 1.5  m 3 plastic bags to control the moisture and temperature. Some amounts of animal fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer (0.2 to 0.4  g/l) were added as a fermentation <b>starter.</b> <b>Air</b> holes were made on the bags to ensure respiration and the moisture was adjusted to 50 %.

5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal. If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. <b>Air</b> turbine <b>starter</b> (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{electric}} starter motor {{was to come}} to dominate the car market, in 1912 there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an <b>air</b> <b>starter</b> motor with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley electrical starter motors (i.e. engaging with a toothed ring on the flywheel).

50|$|Around 3 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds after {{taking off from}} Irkutsk, at an {{altitude}} of 4.000 ft, the engine no 2 suddenly failed. A destruction occurred on the engines <b>air</b> <b>starter</b> that did not shut down after the engine was started and continued to operate at high revs (over 40,000 rpm) with open air bleed valves from the engines. The rotating disk of the turbine then flew from the starter's compartment and entered the engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines. The hydraulic system elements, broke through the rear case of the combustion chamber and left the engine. The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of flames on the engine no 2. The engine no 2 burst into flames.|$|E
50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or <b>air</b> <b>starter.</b>|$|E
