5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (<b>ampicillin</b> sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, <b>ampicillin</b> trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Several steroid {{derivatives}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L.perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic <b>ampicillin.</b> These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ampicillin</b> {{can also}} be used instead of {{amoxicillin}} when person can't swallow and needs antibiotics as it has the same spectrum as amoxicillin.|$|E
25|$|Group B Streptococcus screen. If positive, {{the woman}} {{receives}} IV penicillin or <b>ampicillin</b> while in labor—or, {{if she is}} allergic to penicillin, an alternative therapy, such as IV clindamycin or IV vancomycin.|$|E
25|$|A nonallergic {{amoxicillin}} rash {{may also}} be an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute Epstein Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or <b>ampicillin</b> develop such a rash.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin was one {{of several}} semisynthetic {{derivatives}} of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) developed at Beecham, England in the 1960s. It became available in 1972 and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market (after <b>ampicillin</b> in 1961). Co-amoxiclav became available in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Most newborn {{infants with}} CAP are hospitalized, {{receiving}} IV <b>ampicillin</b> and gentamicin {{for at least}} ten days to treat the common causative agents streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. To treat the herpes simplex virus, IV acyclovir is administered for 21 days.|$|E
25|$|Hospitalized {{patients}} {{without risk}} for pseudomonas: This group requires intravenous antibiotics, with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin), a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam or high-dose <b>ampicillin</b> plus a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: <b>ampicillin,</b> chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|Medications, {{substance}} abuse, {{and environmental}} exposures may all trigger eosinophil dysfunction. Medications such as NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, L-tryptophan, daptomycin and <b>ampicillin</b> and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response {{which results in}} EP. Chemicals such as sulfites, aluminum silicate, and cigarette smoke can cause EP when inhaled. A New York City firefighter developed EP after inhalation of dust from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.|$|E
25|$|SHV-1 shares 68 {{percent of}} its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 {{beta-lactamase}} is most commonly found in K. pneumoniae and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated <b>ampicillin</b> resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known. SHV-5 and SHV-12 {{are among the most}} common.|$|E
25|$|When {{bacterial}} {{cells are}} used as host organisms, the selectable marker is usually a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic that would otherwise kill the cells, typically <b>ampicillin.</b> Cells harboring the plasmid will survive when exposed to the antibiotic, while those that have failed to take up plasmid sequences will die. When mammalian cells (e.g. human or mouse cells) are used, a similar strategy is used, except that the marker gene (in this case typically encoded {{as part of the}} kanMX cassette) confers resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{has long}} been {{recognised}} to have antibacterial properties: {{the addition of the}} fungus to soup broth was known to prevent it from spoiling for several days. [...] Experiments have shown that extracts of P.indusiatus have antioxidant in addition to antimicrobial properties. Mushroom extracts were tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi pathogenic to humans, and in some cases had antimicrobial activity comparable to the antibiotics <b>ampicillin,</b> tetracycline, and nystatin. One of the responsible antibiotics, albaflavenone, was isolated in 2011. It is a sesquiterpenoid that was already known from the soil bacterium Streptomyces albidoflavus. The antioxidant effect of the fungus is due to the presence of polyphenols whose role in reducing cellular damage from oxidative stress is well known.|$|E

2500|$|Antimotility agents, such as loperamide, {{can lead}} to {{prolonged}} illness or intestinal perforation in any invasive diarrhea, and should be avoided. [...] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and <b>ampicillin</b> are ineffective against Campylobacter.|$|E
2500|$|Between 3 and 10% of {{children}} taking amoxicillin (or <b>ampicillin)</b> show a late-developing (>72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "amoxicillin rash". The rash can also occur in adults.|$|E
2500|$|TEM-1 is {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered beta-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria. Up to 90% of <b>ampicillin</b> resistance in E. coli {{is due to the}} production of TEM-1. [...] Also responsible for the <b>ampicillin</b> and penicillin resistance that is seen in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of CAP in {{children}} {{depends on the}} child's age and the severity of illness. Children under five are not usually treated for atypical bacteria. If hospitalization is not required, a seven-day course of amoxicillin is often prescribed, with co-trimaxazole an alternative when there is allergy to penicillins. Further {{studies are needed to}} confirm the efficacy of newer antibiotics. [...] With the increase in drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotics such as cefpodoxime may become more popular. Hospitalized children receive intravenous <b>ampicillin,</b> ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, and a recent study found that a three-day course of antibiotics seems sufficient for most mild-to-moderate CAP {{in children}}.|$|E
2500|$|Amoxicillin {{attaches}} to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a bactericidal compound. It is effective against Streptococci, Pneumococci, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonell, Borrelia burgdorferi and Helicobactor pylori. As a derivative of <b>ampicillin,</b> amoxicillin {{is a member of}} the same family as penicillins and like them, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive and a minor component of Gram-negative bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{systemic}} antibiotics, including (but not limited to) any penicillin-based antibiotic such as <b>ampicillin,</b> cephalosporins, and clindamycin, causes the normal bacterial flora of the bowel to be altered. In particular, when the antibiotic kills off other competing {{bacteria in the}} intestine, any bacteria remaining will have less competition for space and nutrients. The net effect is to permit more extensive growth than normal of certain bacteria. Clostridium difficile is one such type of bacterium. In addition to proliferating in the bowel, C. difficile also produces toxins. Without either toxin A or toxin B, C. difficile may colonize the gut, but is unlikely to cause pseudomembranous colitis. The colitis associated with severe infection {{is part of an}} inflammatory reaction, with the [...] "pseudomembrane" [...] formed by a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.|$|E
2500|$|Various biotechnological {{processes}} {{have been}} developed for industrial scale riboflavin biosynthesis using different microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, [...] as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. The latter organism has been genetically modified to both increase the bacteria's production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (<b>ampicillin)</b> resistance marker, and is now successfully employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification purposes. The chemical company BASF has installed a plant in South Korea, which is specialized on riboflavin production using Ashbya gossypii. The concentrations of riboflavin in their modified strain are so high, that the mycelium has a reddish/brownish color and accumulates riboflavin crystals in the vacuoles, which will eventually burst the mycelium. Riboflavin is sometimes overproduced, possibly as a protective mechanism, by certain bacteria in the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds. [...] One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to <b>ampicillin</b> and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only are}} tissues from maggots {{used to detect}} toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and {{identify}} toxins present in corpses upon death. [...] An instance of {{this finding was demonstrated}} by Edward McDonough, a medical examiner in Connecticut. [...] A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home. [...] Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: <b>ampicillin,</b> Ceclor, doxycyline, erythromycin, Elavil, Lomotil, pentazocine, and Tylenol 3. [...] McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Insect feces, shed pupal cases of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae), and shed larval skins of Dermestes maculates (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were gathered from the corpse at the scene. [...] McDonough sent these to an FBI lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis. [...] The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues. [...] The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies. [...] The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ampicillin</b> {{reacts with}} {{probenecid}} to decrease renal excretion. Large doses of <b>ampicillin</b> {{can increase the}} risk of bleeding with concurrent use of warfarin. <b>Ampicillin</b> use can make oral contraceptives less effective.|$|E
50|$|Pivampicillin is a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of <b>ampicillin.</b> It is a prodrug, {{which is}} thought to enhance the oral {{bioavailability}} of <b>ampicillin</b> because of its greater lipophilicity {{compared to that of}} <b>ampicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sultamicillin is {{a mutual}} prodrug of <b>ampicillin</b> and sulbactam. <b>Ampicillin,</b> a semi-synthetic orally active broad {{spectrum}} antibiotic, is linked via a methylene {{group with a}} beta-lactamase inhibitor. Sultamicillin is chemically oxymethyl penicillinate sulfone ester of <b>ampicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|After absorption, {{sultamicillin}} releases <b>ampicillin</b> and sulbactam {{into the}} system, {{so all the}} antibacterial efficacy of sultamicillin is due to <b>ampicillin</b> and sulbactam. <b>Ampicillin</b> exerts antibacterial activity against sensitive organisms by inhibiting biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide where as sulbactam irreversibly inhibits most important beta-lactamases that occur in resistant strains.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ampicillin</b> {{has been}} used {{extensively}} to treat bacterial infections since 1961. Until the introduction of <b>ampicillin</b> by the British company Beecham, penicillin therapies had only been effective against Gram-positive organisms such as staphylococci and streptococci. <b>Ampicillin</b> (originally branded as 'Penbritin') also demonstrated activity against Gram-negative organisms such as H. influenzae, coliforms, and Proteus spp.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} {{and use of}} <b>ampicillin</b> alone started in 1961. [...] The development and introduction of this drug allowed the use of targeted therapies against gram-negative bacteria. With the rise of beta-lactamase producing bacteria, <b>ampicillin</b> and the other penicillin-derivatives became ineffective to these resistant organisms. With the introduction of beta-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, combined with <b>ampicillin</b> made beta-lactamase producing bacteria susceptible.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, carbenicillin may be preferred as a selecting agent (see Plasmid stabilisation technology) {{because its}} breakdown results in byproducts {{with a lower}} toxicity than analogous antibiotics like <b>ampicillin.</b> Carbenicillin is more stable than <b>ampicillin</b> and results in fewer satellite colonies on selection plates. However, in most situations {{this is not a}} significant problem so <b>ampicillin</b> is sometimes used due to its lower cost.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of sulbactam to <b>ampicillin</b> enhances {{the effects of}} <b>ampicillin.</b> This increases the antimicrobial activity by 4- to 32-fold when compared to <b>ampicillin</b> alone. <b>Ampicillin</b> is a time-dependent antibiotic. Its bacterial killing is largely related to the time that drug concentrations in the body remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The duration of exposure will thus correspond to how much bacterial killing will occur. Various studies have shown that, for maximum bacterial killing, drug concentrations must be above the MIC for 50-60% of {{the time for the}} penicillin group of antibiotics. This means that longer durations of adequate concentrations are more likely to produce therapeutic success. However, when <b>ampicillin</b> is given in combination with sulbactam, regrowth of bacteria has been seen when sulbactam levels fall below certain concentrations. As with many other antibiotics, under-dosing of ampicillin/sulbactam may lead to resistance.|$|E
50|$|CSPC Zhongrun {{penicillin}} and cephalosporin Beta-lactam antibiotic products include 16 {{varieties of}} API and intermediates. The penicillin series includes penicillin G potassium crude, penicillin G potassium, penicillin G sodium, 6-APA, amoxicillin trihydrate, <b>ampicillin</b> trihydrate and <b>ampicillin</b> sodium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ampicillin</b> {{resistance}} {{is a term}} that refers to bacterial resistance to the antibiotic <b>ampicillin.</b> Many strains of bacteria are resistant {{to a variety of}} antibiotics, however the resistance that is most commonly used in research and industry is <b>ampicillin</b> resistance. It is used as a selectable marker in bacterial transformation. A selectable marker is a feature that allows for the scientist to select only for the bacterial cells that contain the gene that allows the bacterium to be resistant. This selection is done by growing the bacteria on or in a medium that contains <b>ampicillin.</b> All the cells that lack the amp resistance gene will be killed off, leaving only those with resistance.|$|E
50|$|Some strains are {{sensitive}} to <b>ampicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|L. {{meningitis}} {{should be}} treated {{with a combination of}} <b>ampicillin</b> and gentamicin because it is synergistic in vitro and provides more rapid bacterial clearance in animal models of infection. After sterilization of CSF, <b>ampicillin</b> should be stopped and gentamicin continued for another 14 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} small chemical difference between <b>ampicillin</b> and benzylpenicillin not only allows for substantial oral activity but also {{results in a}} substantial broadening of antimicrobial spectrum so as to allow for use against many Gram-negative bacteria. Many devices have been employed {{in order to enhance}} still further the oral absorption of <b>ampicillin.</b> Bacampicillin is a prodrug of <b>ampicillin</b> designed for this purpose.An azidopenicillin sodium salt (1) is reacted with mixed carbonate ester 2 (itself prepared from acetaldehyde and ethyl chloroformate) to give ester 3. Reduction of the azido linkage with hydrogen and a suitable catalyst produces bacampillin (4). Both enantiomers are active. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is quickly cleaved by serum esterases to bioactive <b>ampicillin,</b> acetaldehyde, CO2 and ethanol.|$|E
