The second approach, edge marking, requires that the two nodes that make up an edge mark the path with their IP addresses along with the distance between them. This approach would require more state information in each packet than simple node marking but would converge much faster. They suggest three ways to reduce the state information of these approaches into something more manageable.|$|E

A rustic tree lane brings the rambler to Kruszwica, a provincial town with some interesting churches, but no clue where E11 and the Way of St. James continue. Gorges invites to look for a trail marked blue, but the only blue trail to be found makes a short circuit through a suburb of Kruszwica. A better bet is to follow the busy main road to the North, which is marked with the shells of St.James. After 7 km, near Łojewo, one may take a quiet asphalt road, soon unpaved and marked blue. The blue signs lead finally through long-stretched suburbs to the city center of Inowrocław.|$|E
50|$|With {{the entry}} of the second WA team in 1995 he was lured home to join many of his ex-Claremont {{teammates}} at the Fremantle Dockers. Peter Mann played the centre half forward position {{for most of the}} 1995 season. His achievements in that season, 22 games, 33 goals, 159 marks and the Club Champion Award was especially noteworthy. He was the main forward marking target with limited support from John Hutton (13 games, 27 goals), Craig Burrows (19 games, 23 goals), Todd Ridley (18 games, 15 goals), Chris Groom (7 games, 18 goals) Nor did Fremantle's chip and draw style often allow for swift, direct delivery into the forward area. Mann was again productive, if inaccurate, on the Fremantle forward line in 1996, 18 games delivered 25.27 and 98 marks. The introduction of Kingsley Hunter as full forward provided an <b>alternative</b> <b>marking</b> target. His fourth in the Club Champion Award was a credible achievement given a torn foot tendon prevented him training between games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Identifying the {{individuals}} within a population can generate information on life history parameters, generate input data for conservation models, and highlight behavioural traits {{that may affect}} management decisions and error or bias within census methods. Individual animals can be discriminated by features of their vocalisations. This vocal individuality can be utilised as an <b>alternative</b> <b>marking</b> technique in situations where the marks are difficult to detect or animals are sensitive to disturbance. Vocal individuality {{can also be used}} in cases were the capture and handling of an animal is either logistically or ethically problematic. Many studies have suggested that vocal individuality can be used to count and monitor populations over time; however, few have explicitly tested the method in this role. In this review we discuss methods for extracting individuality information from vocalisations and techniques for using this to count and monitor populations over time. We present case studies in birds where vocal individuality has been applied to conservation and we discuss its role in mammals. </p...|$|E

40|$|Toe-tipping is a {{commonly}} used procedure for mark-recapture studies of frogs, {{although it has}} been criticised for its potential influence on frog behaviour, site fidelity and mortality. We compared 24 h return rates of newly toe-tipped frogs to those previously toe-tipped and found no evidence of a stress response reflected by avoidance behaviour for 3 species: Litoria genimaculata, L. rheocola and Nyctimystes dayi. L. nannotis was the only studied species to demonstrate a greater reaction to toe-tipping than handling alone; however, return rates (65 %) in the 1 to 3 mo after marking were the highest of any species, showing that the reaction did not endure. The comparatively milder short-term response to toe-tipping in N. dayi (24 % return rate) may have been caused by the species' reduced opportunity for breeding. Intermediate-term return rates were relatively high for 2 species, L. nannotis and L. genimaculata, given their natural history, suggesting there were no major adverse effects of toe-tipping. Longer-term adverse effects could not be ruled out for L. rheocola and N. dayi, which had relatively moderate intermediate-term return rates (33 and 36 %, respectively). We recommend that future studies directly observe the health effects of toe-tipping, are longer term and consider <b>alternative</b> <b>marking</b> methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} acquiring on-job performance evaluation marks for enlisted personnel is deficient in two important respects: (1) the scales do not adequately differentiate among actual levels of ratee performance, and (2) the manual forms and procedures do not per-mit timely processing {{and application of}} the data for important indi-vidual personnel actions (e. g., advancement, assignment, and quality retention).

30|$|The bMCU {{test can}} be easily {{implemented}} in the physics classroom. Test instructions are short and readily understandable by secondary school students. The test can be processed in approximately 20  min and analyzed in 1  min per test by simply checking answer alternatives and summing all of the items solved without mistakes (all of the correct answer alternatives and no wrong answer <b>alternative</b> <b>marked).</b> The distribution of the item parameters that represents each item’s difficulty enables a differentiated measurement of secondary school students’ abilities in the average achievement range with most items covering this area. Simultaneously, there are two easily solvable, encouraging items and two particularly difficult items that allow assessment at the top end and prevent ceiling effects. We ascertained that the instrument assesses the same underlying ability for girls and boys and for different age and intelligence groups. The test seems to measure conceptual understanding of Newton’s mechanics unambiguously, independent of both the quality of physics instruction and whether the test has been taken only once or repeatedly. Consequently, whenever fair and efficient assessment of understanding of Newton’s mechanics is required, the bMCU test may be considered. The test could not only complement summative assessments but also be highly valuable {{in the context of}} formative assessment (e.g., Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, 2005; Wiliam, 2010), in which efficiency is especially important.|$|R
40|$|This thesis details an {{experimental}} and simulation investigation of some novel all-optical signal processing techniques for future optical communication networks. These all-optical techniques include modulation format conversion, phase discrimination and clock recovery. The methods detailed {{in this thesis}} use the nonlinearities associated with semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) to manipulate signals in the optical domain. Chapter 1 provides an introduction into the work detailed in this thesis, discusses the increased demand for capacity in today’s optical fibre networks and finally explains why all-optical signal processing may be of interest for future optical networks. Chapter 2 discusses the relevant background information required to fully understand the all-optical techniques demonstrated in this thesis. Chapter 3 details some pump-probe measurement techniques {{used to calculate the}} gain and phase recovery times of a long SOA. A remarkably fast gain recovery is observed and the wavelength dependent nature of this recovery is investigated. Chapter 4 discusses the experimental demonstration of an all-optical modulation conversion technique which can convert on-off- keyed data into either duobinary or <b>alternative</b> <b>mark</b> inversion. In Chapter 5 a novel phase sensitive frequency conversion scheme capable of extracting the two orthogonal components of a quadrature phase modulated signal into two separate frequencies is demonstrated. Chapter 6 investigates a novel all-optical clock recovery technique for phase modulated optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing superchannels and finally Chapter 7 provides a brief conclusion...|$|R

50|$|Comparative {{judgement}} {{becomes a}} viable <b>alternative</b> to <b>marking</b> {{when it is}} implemented as an adaptive web-based assessment system. In this, the 'scores' (the model parameter for each object) are re-estimated after each 'round' of judgements in which, on average, each object has been judged one more time. In the next round, each script is compared only to another whose current estimated score is similar, which increases the amount of statistical information contained in each judgement. As a result, the estimation procedure is more efficient than random pairing, or any other pre-determined pairing system like those used in classical comparative judgement applications.
