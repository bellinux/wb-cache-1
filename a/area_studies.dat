25|$|Within the {{framework}} of the new California Master Plan for Higher Education, signed into state law in 1959, Chancellor Murphy worked to develop a long-range plan for further development and increased autonomy for UCLA. He rapidly increased the number of interdisciplinary institutes and specialized research centers, including various international <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> centers. He worked with the Regents to increase UCLA's library holdings at a faster pace than Berkeley's library so the two would reach parity. A School of Library Service was instituted in 1960, followed by the School of Architecture and Urban Planning in 1966. The quarter system was implemented in 1965.|$|E
25|$|While {{generally}} {{not considered a}} separate academic area of study in and of itself, it involves scholars and practitioners from many fields and specialties.

It involves study and discussion of a diverse range of issues including but not limited to: civilian control of the military, military professionalism, war, civil-military operations, military institutions, and other related subjects. International in scope, civil-military relations involves discussion and research from across the world. The theoretical discussion can include non-state actors {{as well as more}} traditional nation-states. Other research involves discerning the details of military political attitudes, voting behavior, and the potential impact on and interaction with democratic society as well as military families.|$|E
