Thick-lipped gouramis are generally peaceful, easy to keep fish well suited to the tropical community aquarium. Like other Trichogaster species, it tends to be a bit shy <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> plant life to hide under if it feels threatened. They eat a variety of foods including flake, bloodworms, and brine shrimp. These fish should not be maintained with fish such as barbs or their thread-like ventral fins may be nipped to stumps. C. labiosus is one of the easiest species of gourami to breed. The male likes to build bubble nests and is not as likely as other species to bully the female if the female is not yet ready to spawn.|$|E
50|$|That night, Matt is awoken by the {{squealing}} noise again. He {{heads down}} to the back porch to find a butchered and bloodied pig left on the stoop. Not wanting to worry Shelby any further, Matt buries the pig without telling her about it. Before leaving for his call, he installs security cameras around the property and has his sister Lee (Adina Porter) stay with Shelby. In an interview, it is revealed that Lee (Angela Bassett as re-enactor) and Shelby do not get along. Lee also reveals {{that she has a}} background in criminal psychology, and used to be a police officer before an abuse of prescription pain killers led to her being fired. Lee witnesses Shelby drinking and tells her that she is barely holding on to her sobriety <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> if Shelby did not drink alcohol around her. Afterwords, Lee goes to sleep but is awoken by squealing. Then, her door mysteriously opens and an empty wine bottle rolls inside. Lee angrily confronts Shelby about the empty bottle, however while they argue, the house is being surrounded by knife and torch wielding intruders. While in his hotel, Matt receives an alert showing the house being invaded. He frantically tries to call the two women but neither one pick up as they are both arguing. Matt hurries home to try to help Shelby himself. The women's argument is interrupted when Lee hears an intruder enter the house. The two women follow the intruder down into the basement, where they find a television playing a creepy found footage film. The power fails and the two women are trapped in the basement.|$|E

Realizing that environmental scientists of different disciplines sometimes use the same words—such as sustainability or efficiency—with distinct meanings, a crucial basis for our successful teamwork has been to define clear terminology and a mutual understanding of what we are talking about. Our impression was that many scientists, practitioners, and politicians feel the same, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> greater clarity concerning technical terms sometimes used in a colloquial way. This situation motivated us to write this essay.

The latest stand-alone version of the tool allows users to visualize their data exports. For analyzing the users’ perceptions of the Data Track in regard to transparency features and the concepts of data export and data portability, we have conducted a qualitative user study. We observed that although users had rather {{little interest in the}} visualization of derived data activities revealed in the Google location file, they were interested in other kinds of derived data like usage patterns for different service providers. Also, as earlier user studies revealed, we again confirmed that it is confusing for users to differentiate between locally and remotely stored and controlled data. Finally, in spite of being concerned about the security of the data exported to their machines, for exercising data portability rights pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation, most participants would prefer to first export and edit the data before uploading it to another service provider <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> using a tool such as the Data Track for helping them in this context...|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} from undergraduate medical education to learning in clinical clerkships {{can be difficult}} for students. Learning in clinical practice requires awareness of learning opportunities and goals, active elaboration and reflection. Staff should provide students with guidance to learn from their experiences. A new Introductory Clerkship was designed to facilitate the start of goal-oriented, active and reflective work-based learning. This four-week clerkship {{is a result of}} the cooperation of six major specialties in the university hospital. The innovations included explicitly formulated goals, a description of the student's activities in daily practice and of the staff's role, group meetings, a logbook, a halfway formative interview and a final summative interview. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent the innovations of the new Introductory Clerkship were implemented and how students and residents valued them. Two questionnaires were constructed: one was administered to students (n = 54) and the other to residents (n = 27). Students considered participation in daily practice very instructive, although more observations of history taking and physical examination are wanted. The interviews and group meetings promote students' learning. Use of the logbook needs improvement. Residents perceived a shortage of time <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> more participation of staff members, as well as a better preparation for supervising tasks. Overall, the study demonstrates that it is possible to introduce innovations in clinical clerkships to improve the learning environment of work-based learning...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{characterization}} {{of a family}} with a mutation in the uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein) gene. BackgroundWe have recently identified a mutation in the uromodulin gene in a large family affected with hyperuricemia, gout, and renal failure. The purpose of this investigation {{is to provide a}} comprehensive {{characterization of}} the clinical findings of this syndrome in family members who had a mutation in the uromodulin gene. MethodsAn extended family suffering from hyperuricemia and gout was identified by a local practitioner. After consent was obtained, patients provided a directed clinical history and blood and urine specimens for chemical and genetic testing. All family members were tested for the presence of uromodulin gene mutations by direct DNA sequence analysis. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of family members carrying the affected mutation were then investigated. ResultsThirty-nine family members were found to have an exon 5 uromodulin gene mutation (g. 1966 1922 del), and 29 unaffected family members were identified. The cardinal clinical features in individuals with the uromodulin mutation included hyperuricemia, decreased fractional excretion of uric acid, and chronic interstitial renal disease leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the fifth through seventh decade. Women did not always develop hyperuricemia or gout, but still developed progressive chronic renal failure. ConclusionMutation of the uromodulin gene resulted in hyperuricemia, reduced fractional excretion of uric acid, and renal failure. Genetic testing will be required to definitively identify individuals suffering from this condition. We are interested in studying other families that may suffer from this condition <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> any such referrals...|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{was aimed}} at {{pre-operational}} education {{and its impact on}} the lifestyle of the women after hysterectomy together with these women´s awareness of appropriate lifestyle after hysterectomy in some hospitals of the Plzeň region. The thesis also led to completing an effective educational handbook for women after hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is one of the most common types of major surgery performed on women. It is often understood very negatively, some women can even see it as an attack to their gender identity. On the other side, it reduces or eliminates long-term health problems. Therefore the clients should be entirely and properly informed and so be confident about their lifestyle after coming home from the hospital. Women in chosen hospitals suffer from lack of information on the sexual life after hysterectomy. The non-educated women felt the lack of information on the lifestyle after hysterectomy <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> an educational handbook. They had no information on sexual life after hysterectomy, the ways of getting a complex spa care and the impact of the operation on menopause. The research findings have proved the need to educate women in the lifestyle after hysterectomy. The information on the life after coming home from the hospital are often omitted. Based on this thesis, the educational handbook could be prepared for women after hysterectomy. This way all women can get sufficient information which will positively impact their mental condition after surgery. The thesis can also be used as a complete source of information on hysterectomy...|$|E

NEON, once fully operational with 47 tower sites, will represent the largest single-provider EC network globally. Its standardized observation and data processing suite is {{designed specifically for}} inter-site comparability and analysis of continental-scale ecological change, including rich contextual data such as airborne remote sensing and in-situ sampling bouts. First carbon cycle products become available in 2017, including data and software. These products strive to incorporate lessons-learned through collaborations with AmeriFlux, ICOS, LTER and others, to suggest novel systemic solutions, and to synergize ongoing research efforts across science communities. Here, we present {{an overview of the}} ongoing product release, alongside efforts to integrate and synergize with existing infrastructures, networks and communities. Near-real-time carbon cycle observations in “basic” and “expanded”, self-describing HDF 5 formats become accessible from the NEON Data Portal, including an Application Program Interface. A pilot project is underway to investigate their subsequent ingest into the AmeriFlux processing pipeline, together with inclusion in FLUXNET globally harmonized data releases. Software for reproducible, extensible and portable data analysis and science operations management also becomes available. This includes the eddy 4 R family of R-packages underlying the carbon cycle data product generation, together with the ability to directly participate in open development via GitHub version control and Dockerhub image hosting. In addition, templates for science operations management include a web-based field maintenance application and a graphical user interface to simplify problem tracking and resolution along the entire data chain. We hope that this first release of NEON carbon cycle products can initiate further collaboration and synergies in challenge areas, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> input and discussion on continued development...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the main focus}} is on the {{experiences}} of former street children as learners. The main emphasis of this study is the manner in which such experiences influence these children’s learning towards constructing new identities. By examining the experiences of former street children in a school environment, namely a teaching and learning environment, this study will contribute towards the literature by providing focused and relevant information pertaining to the way former street children experience learning. By focusing on these particular learners from the street, the study attempts to explore and build an insightful knowledge in terms of understanding how former street children perceive learning in relation to their present personal and past life on the streets. Through this study the researcher will hopefully be able to determine how former street children feel, experience and relate to teaching and learning within a school context. Data collection for this study included the researcher’s observations and face-to-face unstructured in-depth phenomenological interviews with learners who are formerly from the streets. Among others, the study found that these particular learners have low self- esteem, a low opinion of themselves, and lack of self- confidence. The study also revealed that some of these learners are struggling academically <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> it if academic was parallel with vocational skills so as to equip them for the world of work. It also transpired that learners who have relationships with those who have not been to the streets changed their lives for the better by learning from their peers but those who have relationships with other former street children at this school continue to engage in deviant behaviour, for many schooling has helped them to reclaim their childhood identity...|$|E
