5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} {{that there are still}} unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta. This suggestion would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) to a new genus, create a third genus for the blue nuthatch, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> fourth for the beautiful nuthatch.|$|E

Unfortunately, Caty Swits (1743–77) died during the return journey. Ann Bleecker was devastated by the loss of three generations of women in her family.|$|E

The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also to dictate the only approach to the gate.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{proposed}} for a launch in 2020, the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Jupiter's moons. In February 2009 {{it was announced}} that ESA/NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. ESA's contribution still faced funding competition from other ESA projects. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the cheetah ranged across vast {{stretches}} of Asia: from the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula {{in the west}} to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as the Caspian and Aral Seas. However, the cheetah has disappeared from the majority of its historic range, save for Iran <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> few areas in Afghanistan, the Indian subcontinent, and Turkmenistan.|$|E
5|$|Mariela Castañón, a {{reporter}} for the daily newspaper La Hora, reported that the ground collapsed suddenly, taking a three-story house that was used as a factory, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> security guard, along with it.

5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> brain tumor.|$|E
5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{announced}} in 2010 that a biodiversity study from 2009 {{in the gallery}} forest of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> new species.

5|$|Apatosaurus is a genus in {{the family}} Diplodocidae. It {{is one of the}} more basal genera, with only Amphicoelias <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the {{subfamily}} Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only Brontosaurus is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. Brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its only species was reclassified as A.excelsus in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that Brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, Apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> hetaera, Aspasia {{was free of}} the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

Although Webster married someone else, his family held onto the portrait until the 1980s, when it was auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Gloria and Richard Manney in 1981. The couple donated or sold the miniatures of their art collection, including Beauty Revealed, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E

5|$|Ornithischians are {{abundant}} in the Scollard Lance, Laramie, Lance, Denver, and Hell Creek Formation. The main groups of ornithischians are ankylosaurians, ornithopods, ceratopsians, and pachycephalosaurians. Three ankylosaurians are known, Ankylosaurus, Denversaurus, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> species of Edmontonia or an undescribed genus. Multiple genera of ceratopsians are known from the formation other than Triceratops, the leptoceratopsid Leptoceratops, and the chasmosaurine ceratopsids Torosaurus,Nedoceratops and Tatankaceratops. Ornithopods are common in the Hell Creek Formation, and are known from several species of the ornithopod Thescelosaurus, and the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus, and a possible species of Parasaurolophus. Several pachycephalosaurians {{have been found in}} the Hell Creek Formation and in similar formations. Among them are the derived pachycephalosaurids Stygimoloch, Dracorex, Pachycephalosaurus, Sphaerotholus, and an undescribed specimen from North Dakota. The first two might be junior synonyms of Pachycephalosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Several notable Tyrannosaurus remains {{have been}} found in the Hell Creek Formation. During the Maastrichtian this area was subtropical, with a warm and humid climate. The flora {{consisted}} mostly of angiosperms, but also included trees like dawn redwood (Metasequoia) and Araucaria. Tyrannosaurus shared this ecosystem with Triceratops, related ceratopsians Nedoceratops, Tatankaceratops and Torosaurus, the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> species of Parasaurolophus, the armored dinosaurs Denversaurus, Edmontonia and Ankylosaurus, the dome headed dinosaurs Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch, Sphaerotholus, and Dracorex, the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Struthiomimus, Orcomimus, Acheroraptor, Dakotaraptor, Richardoestesia, Paronychodon, Pectinodon, and Troodon.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) had a {{proposed}} launch date in 2020, {{and was a}} joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 {{it was announced that}} ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. ESA's contribution faced funding competition from other ESA projects, but on 2 May 2012 the European part of the mission, renamed Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), obtained a L1 launch slot in 2022 with an Ariane 5 in the ESA's Cosmic Vision science programme. The spacecraft will orbit Ganymede and conduct multiple flyby investigations of Callisto and Europa.|$|E
5|$|The Ioviani and Herculiani legions and equites Dalmatae are not {{mentioned}} by the sources as under Julian, but {{as part of}} the Gaul comitatus of usurper Magnentius. They are likely to have been inherited by Julian. If all these units were present at Strasbourg, the infantry total is 1,500 short, or 3,500 if Severus commanded an extra 2,000 men. Probably the names of a number of auxilia regiments (<b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> legion) are missing in our sources. If so, {{at least one of these}} units is likely to be a sagittarii (archer) unit, as a comitatus would be incomplete without archer capacity. Overall, the most likely scenario is that Julian's force at Strasbourg consisted of 5-6 legiones and 10-14 auxilia of infantry and 6 vexillationes of cavalry.|$|E
