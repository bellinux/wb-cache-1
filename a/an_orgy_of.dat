500|$|Despite these strengths, the castles {{and town}} walls are now {{recognised}} to {{have also had}} military flaws. The castles were much larger than {{they needed to be}} in order to protect against Welsh attack, but the sheer scale of them meant that the Crown could not afford to maintain or garrison them properly. The fortifications were in some regards simply too big, and as historian Michael Prestwich notes, smaller projects might actually have been more effective. Rather than the sites being scientifically designed, historian Richard Morris suggested that [...] "the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget".|$|E

500|$|In 1277 Edward I {{launched}} a final {{invasion of the}} remaining native Welsh strongholds in North Wales, intending to establish his rule over the region on a permanent basis. As part of this occupation he instructed his leading nobles to construct eight new castles across the region; Aberystwyth and Builth in mid-Wales and Beaumaris, Conwy, Caernarfon, Flint, Harlech and Rhuddlan Castle in North Wales. Historian R. Allen Brown has described these as [...] "amongst the finest achievements of medieval military architecture [...] ". The castles varied in design but were typically characterised by powerful mural towers along the castle walls, with multiple, over-lapping firing points and large and extremely well defended barbicans. The castles were intended {{to be used by}} the king when in the region and included extensive high-status accommodation. Edward also established various new English towns, and in several cases the new castles were designed to be used alongside the fortified town walls as part of an integrated defence. Historian Richard Morris has suggested that [...] "the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget".|$|E

500|$|During the revolution, {{there was}} <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> {{violence}} committed against the South Asian and Arab communities {{with thousands of}} women being raped by the Okello's followers, much looting and massacres of Arabs all over the island. The American diplomat Don Petterson described the killings of Arabs by the African majority {{as an act of}} genocide. Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but {{it is fair to say}} that in parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man with a taste for cruelty frequently went on the radio to urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality. As a Pan-African nationalist who made his followers sing [...] "God Bless Africa" [...] whenever he marched through the streets, Okello appealed to the black majority, but at same time, as a militant Christian who claimed to hear the voice of God in his head, Okello's appeal on an island whose population was 95% Muslim was limited. It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by the voices in his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ. Okello claimed that Christ was an African and that Africa was God's special continent.|$|E
