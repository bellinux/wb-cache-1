40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the inter-operator reproducibility of three-dimensional (3 D) images of teeth captured by <b>a</b> digital <b>impression</b> technique to <b>a</b> conventional <b>impression</b> technique in vivo. Twelve participants with complete natural dentition were included in this study. <b>A</b> digital <b>impression</b> of the mandibular molars of these participants was made by two operators with different levels of clinical experience, 3 or 16 years, using an intra-oral scanner (Lava COS, 3 M ESPE). <b>A</b> silicone <b>impression</b> also was made by the same operators using the double mix impression technique (Imprint 3, 3 M ESPE). Stereolithography (STL) data were directly exported from the Lava COS system, while STL data of a plaster model made from silicone impression were captured by a three-dimensional (3 D) laboratory scanner (D 810, 3 shape). The STL datasets recorded by two different operators were compared using 3 D evaluation software and superimposed using the best-fit-algorithm method (least-squares method, PolyWorks, InnovMetric Software) for each impression technique. Inter-operator reproducibility as evaluated by average discrepancies of corresponding 3 D data was compared between the two techniques (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The visual inspection of superimposed datasets revealed that discrepancies between repeated digital impression were smaller than observed with silicone impression. Confirmation was forthcoming from statistical analysis revealing significantly smaller average inter-operator reproducibility using <b>a</b> digital <b>impression</b> technique (0. 014 ± 0. 02 mm) than when using <b>a</b> conventional <b>impression</b> technique (0. 023 ± 0. 01 mm). The results of this in vivo study suggest that inter-operator reproducibility with <b>a</b> digital <b>impression</b> technique may be better than that of <b>a</b> conventional <b>impression</b> technique and is independent of the clinical experience of the operator...|$|R

40|$|This {{standard}} addresses {{latent print}} examinations when {{two or more}} friction ridge impressions {{are considered to be}} deposited on an object as a single act of touch, also referred to as <b>a</b> simultaneous <b>impression.</b> Simultaneous <b>impression</b> examination is <b>an</b> advanced technique that should be utilized with caution. A complete analysis of the impressions should occur before concluding simultaneity. The SWGFAST Glossary defines <b>a</b> simultaneous <b>impression</b> as “Two or more friction ridge impressions from the same hand or foot deposited concurrently. ” Two or more latent friction ridge impressions from the same hand which are consistent with simultaneity can be used as an aggregate and considered <b>a</b> single <b>impression</b> when conducting examinations. The use of the term simultaneous <b>impressions,</b> with <b>an</b> “s”, infers that more than one simultaneous <b>impression</b> exists in <b>a</b> case. This document sets forth the standard for (1) analyzing two or more friction ridge impressions to determine whether they are consistent with having been deposited on an object concurrently as a single act of touch, and is referred to as <b>a</b> simultaneous <b>impression,</b> (2) analyzing <b>a</b> simultaneous <b>impression</b> to determine whether it is of value for comparison purposes and how it will be compared, (3) reaching conclusions from the comparison of <b>a</b> simultaneous <b>impression</b> with known exemplars, (4) verification o...|$|R

5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification.

But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
