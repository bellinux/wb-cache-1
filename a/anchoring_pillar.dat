The definition of science teachers competencies and their taxonomy are very important in understanding the educational reform in European context.. The recent literature and many reforms {{in the field of}} science teacher education suggest that teacher preparation has a “threefold structure” with the <b>anchoring</b> <b>pillars</b> being Subject Matter Knowledge (SMK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK) and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). Science education programs should pay more attention into the learning of science in social and technological context.

It is the largest structure on the world and it floats over Tokyo Bay while being build largely by robots. It houses 750, 000 people in skyscrapers that dangle from it like fruit on a tree. It consists of multiple layers of pyramid-shaped exoskeletons that are <b>anchored</b> to massive <b>pillars</b> that rest in the bay (Discovery Channel, 2005). On a micro-level the pyramidal exoskeleton’s main composite are carbon nano tubes. These cylindrical nano tubes are ulta-strong and gossamer light, e. g. it’s a hundred times stronger than stainless steel and a square kilometre of the material would only weigh thirty kilograms (Wikipedia, 2006). But regretting all these advantages, the material on its own is isn’t malleable. Conversely polymer does inhibit this malleable-property. But a covalent bond direct between both materials isn’t sufficient, because when bending it the nano tubes pull out. So to form this bond between their advantageous properties and simultaneously to reconcile their incompatibilities an intermediary chemical is needed, which is carboxylic acid (cooh) (Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review, 2002). This cooh enforces the alignment that is needed in creating flexible structures that have an unrivalled height of almost two kilometres of which its main composite, cylindrical carbon nano tubes, is approximatel...|$|R
40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) {{networks}} {{are being built}} and expanded around the world, contributing to the definition and realisation of geodetic reference frames {{as well as providing}} reliable and accurate positioning infrastructure {{for a wide range of}} applications. Depending on the purpose of the GNSS station, CORS antenna monuments typically vary from concrete <b>pillars</b> <b>anchored</b> to bedrock to masts attached to buildings. An antenna mount is used to connect the GNSS antenna to the monument. In all cases it is desired that the CORS antenna is oriented to True North in order to gain maximum benefit from GNSS antenna modelling. Other requirements generally include the unambiguous definition of the survey mark and Antenna Reference Point (ARP), and a zero or minimal antenna height. This paper introduces the CORSnet-NSW Adjustable Antenna Mount (CAAM), developed by NSW Land and Property Information (LPI) for CORSnet-NSW, LPI’s rapidly growing GNSS CORS network covering the state of New South Wales, Australia. The CAAM was purposely designed to be incorporated into (rather than simply attached to) antenna masts located on buildings or free-standing pole monuments but can also be used for pillar monuments. Being free of removable parts, it is adjustable in order to orient the antenna to True North without introducing an antenna height, thereby allowing clear definition and maximum traceability of the survey mark and the ARP. LPI encourages adoption of the CAAM for use in other GNSS CORS networks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Dev. Studies) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. According to the World Development Report 2008, if {{the world}} is {{committed}} to reducing poverty and achieving sustainable growth, it would unleash the powers of agriculture {{because the majority of}} the world’s poor depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The financial sector can {{play an important role in}} supporting agriculture through the extension of agricultural credit. Literature shows that this can only be successfully achieved when financial institutions operate under stable macroeconomic conditions. This study explores the experience of giving agricultural credit under volatile macroeconomic conditions. It focuses on a case study of Zimbabwe, whose hyperinflationary levels reached over 3 000 % in 2007 and a monthly rate of 79, 6 billion percent in mid-November 2008. Findings from interviews with informants from stakeholder institutions in the agricultural sector revealed that the problem of agricultural credit in Zimbabwe was not only due to hyperinflation but also due to poor institutional capacity and dual agricultural policies. Some of these problems existed before hyperinflation. The paper argues that the future of agricultural credit in Zimbabwe is <b>anchored</b> on three <b>pillars.</b> The first is a stable macroeconomic environment. This involves bringing down hyperinflation, establishing land tenure security and other rights and improving rural infrastructure. The second is development of financial institutions and systems (building institutional capacity, building a culture of loan repayment and capitalisation through private partnership). Finally, the third is necessary political will...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods to}} combine 3 D cell culture, microfluidics and gradients on a controlled cellular scale. 3 D cultures in biological extracellular matrix gels or synthetic gels {{bridge the gap}} between organ-tissue cultures and traditional 2 D cultures. A device for embedding, anchoring and culturing cells in a controlled 3 D flow through micro-environment was designed and evaluated. The device was realized using an etched silicon pillar flow chamber filled with gel mixed with cells. The <b>pillars</b> <b>anchor</b> and stabilize the gel as well as increase the surface to volume ratio, permitting higher surface flow rates and improving diffusion properties. Within the structure cells were still viable and proliferating after six days of cultivation, showing {{that it is possible to}} perform medium- to-long term cultivation of cells in a controlled 3 D environment. This concept was further developed to include controllable and time stable 3 D microgradient environments. In this system stable diffusion gradients can be generated by the application of two parallel fluid flows with different composition against opposite sides of a gel plug with embedded cells. Culture for up to two weeks was performed showing cells still viable and proliferating. The cell tracer dye calcein was used to verify gradient formation as the fluorescent intensity in exposed cells was proportional to the position in the chamber. Cellular response to an applied stimulus was demonstrated by use of an adenosine triphosphate gradient where the onset of an intracellular calcium release also depends on cell position.

Simplifying the process of collection could be achieved {{with the use of the}} modern national banking system, fully computerized and interconnected networks for remote access under total control of the Central Bank of Brazil and Federal Revenue in Brazil, creating a single tax rate applied to moving speed of each bank account, excluding the changes to financial applications. The proceeds arising from the application of the single rate will be proportional to drive consumption of each Brazilian citizen, thus enabling a substantial increase in tax revenues, in view of the solidity of the base, simplifying the process of collection and combating tax evasion. Another aspect to be taken into account in the proposed tax reform is that it must take into account issues related to the General System of Social Security and the Public Debt and Contractual Federal Government's resources and mechanisms for ensuring long term sustainability and as possible the balance of public accounts. The National Tax System will is <b>anchored</b> on the <b>pillars</b> of the Tax on Financial Transactions (IMF) Annual Revenue Adjustment (Tax AAR) and Imported Products (II).

40|$|Microstructured {{interfaces}} such as micropillars made of polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) {{provide a}} novel approach both as topologically defined, force sensing substrates in cell culture as well as scaffolds for biomimetic protein assays. This work {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, PDMS micropillar arrays functionalized with fibronectin, are applied as a biomechanical microenvironment for immortalized human gingival keratinocytes (IHGKs) and gingival connective-tissue fibroblasts (GCTFs). IHGKs and GCTFs show successful adhesion and growth on the pillar heads and exert forces up to about 110 nN in the case of IHGKs and about 174 nN for GCTFs. Varying the interpillar distances affects the early keratinocyte differentiation and morphology. At decreasing inter-pillar distances the IHGKs show an increased keratin 1 (K 1) extension in the cytoplasm, increased mRNA transcription of keratin 1 and a shape change from a more linear to a more round form. A novel GCTF-IHGK co-culture system is developed as a model of the epithelial tissue, to study explicitly the role of the GCTFs in the morphogenesis of the derived epithelial equivalents. The epithelial equivalents, cultured for 7 and 14 days on GCTF-populated pillar arrays, are found more similar to the in vivo phenotype than the GCTF-free cultures. These findings are confirmed by following the mRNA transcription levels for keratin 1. A novel, transparent microfluidic platform, based on PDMS pillars is developed {{in the second part of}} this work. It is designed to investigate actin cortex models and to provide control over the physicochemical environment, allowing simultaneous high resolution fluorescence microscopy. The formation of crosslinking networks is observed using various crosslinkers, such as filamin, myosin II, alpha-actinin and magnesium ions. Dependent of the geometric configuration of the actin filaments <b>anchored</b> to the <b>pillar</b> tops, so-called zipping crosslinks are observed. The zipping velocity is both influenced by the flow speed, as well as the number and the configuration of the filaments involved in the process. It is found to range between 2 - 15 µm/s. To further quantify the crosslinking process, the flow-cell is combined with an optical tweezers system. The unzipping forces are measured for the crosslinkers alpha-actinin and magnesium ions. Forces of about 17 - 20 pN are derived for magnesium ions and about 30 - 45 pN for alpha-actinin...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 112 - 117. Rapid {{technological}} advances and global economic changes resulting from {{technological advances}} and global economic integration are causing difficulties in maintaining the employability of large segment of Arab population including Gee labour force. At the same time, new forces are creating new opportunities for increased economic growth and employment. However, it is the level and quality of a country's labor skills that are becoming the critical factors in {{taking advantage of the}} opportunities and minimizing the social costs of globalization. In this work, globalization has been addressed in its relevance and the direct impact imposed on the labor force, including productivity, competition and emerging labor markets. Gee countries are being presented as the case study for this dissertation and were analyzed in the context of security and socio-economic stability, attributed to social and economic problems that has been escalating decades ago and have not been addressed properly. The MENA region and Gee although they both vary in their GDP levels but are similar that they both lag behind on the globalized scale! The MENA region's economy and labor structure were highlighted within the context of labor migration to the Gee and contemporary challenges of globalization. Projections concerning future labour force demand imply that economic growth in GCC countries could fail to generate enough jobs to accommodate new national entrants to the labour markets in the next five to ten years. Hence the expansive 'womb to tomb" welfare system {{will not be able to}} continue to meet the expectations of the nationals in the contemporary area of globalization and the fall oil revenues. Considerable proportions of oil revenues have been invested to establish a welfare state that caters not only to the basic needs of the average citizen but also to the unlimited demands of a population with continuously rising expectations. The dissertation has pointed out to a major point of great importance, is that political security cannot be achieved apart from economic and social security. Economic and social security constitutes the main <b>pillar</b> <b>anchoring</b> a political security. Economic and social security are related to the State's ability to provide minimum living standards (economic and social) for members of the society in the manner, which improves their quality of life. Thus, comprehensive development of the society in terms of advancing quality of life is a key indicator of the economic and social security. To achieve political, economic and social security in the GCC, its implementation must be based on two basic preconditions as follows: material and human resources challenges imposed by social and economic structure. The paper validated the challenges and impacts of globalization on the socio-economic structure of the GCC countries, pointing out to the interdependence between both the socio-economic dimension and the security of the GCC countries. Several examples, discussion methods and figures were generated to support this assumption. 1 bound copy: vii, 117 leaves; ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
