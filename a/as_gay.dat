5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate.

Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify <b>as</b> <b>gay</b> or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R.

The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, <b>as</b> <b>Gay</b> feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E

He since became a fan favorite and began to be featured regularly throughout the series and as a main character in subsequent X-Men-related titles, including New X-Men and the short-lived Young X-Men.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days later}} Herb Caen, a {{columnist}} at The San Francisco Chronicle, exposed Sipple <b>as</b> <b>gay</b> {{and a friend}} of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. Time magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's gay community. Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, now refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the Chronicle for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of the United Kingdom does not ask citizens to define their sexuality. However, {{a survey by the}} UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 1.5% of Britons identified themselves <b>as</b> <b>gay</b> or bisexual, and the ONS suggests that this is in line with other surveys showing the number between 0.3% and 3%. Estimates of lesbians are sometimes not differentiated in studies of same-sex households, such as those performed by the U.S. census, and estimates of total gay, lesbian, or bisexual population by the UK government. However, polls in Australia have recorded a range of self-identified lesbian or bisexual women from 1.3% to 2.2% of the total population.|$|E
