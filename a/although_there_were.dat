5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> Spanish missions, pueblos (towns), presidios (forts), and ranchos {{along the}} coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only {{a handful}} of {{consistent}} superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways.|$|E
50|$|On December 18, 1999, Fossmo {{found his}} wife Heléne {{dead in the}} bathtub. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a hole in her skull and <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a toxic {{concentration}} of dextropropoxyphene in her blood, her death was ruled an accident.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{differences}} in mate values {{between males and}} females; Buss (1989) also found that traits such as intelligence and health are rated equally in terms of importance by both men and women. This suggests that <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> obvious differences, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> also inherent similarities between the two.|$|R

5|$|Mario Party 4 was {{met with}} {{positive}} reception, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several complaints regarding a lack of originality and slow pacing during games. The game won the Family Game of The Year award at the Interactive Achievement Awards of 2003.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moved back}} to once-weekly Saturday broadcasts. All episodes were 45 minutes long, though they also exist in 25-minute versions. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> now only 13 episodes in the season, the total running time {{remained}} approximately {{the same as in}} previous seasons since the episodes were almost twice as long.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a few modifications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season {{one was the}} way the show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no deaths, {{the fire}} caused $1.8million of damage, and {{officers}} were injured. In {{the aftermath of}} the riot, there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings to the prison authorities of the risk of such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{no reports}} of deaths, {{according}} to the National Hurricane Center, the storm capsized two ships, and washed two more ashore. The heavy rain caused mudslides, which buried one man in his home; he was later rescued by his family. In and around the port of Acapulco, minor flooding was reported and 42 trees toppled. Four landslides blocked four roads in Nayarit. A total of 13 families were evacuated in Rosamorada.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{periodic}} {{attempts at}} reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the Necropolis station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign, and services generally continued as normal.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> objections {{to the creation of a}} national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E
5|$|Early in its existence, Lenny {{produced}} large {{waves and}} high tides along the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia, sinking two boats and flooding 1,200houses.
