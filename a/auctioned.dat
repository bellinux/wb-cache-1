5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured {{a replica of}} the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the <b>auctioned</b> trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the <b>auctioned</b> trophy was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E

40|$|M. Sc. This {{dissertation}} investigates how auctioneer agents can maximise {{the revenue}} of an <b>auction.</b> <b>Auctions</b> are an effective solution to agent negotiation {{because of their}} simplicity. They are therefore {{the most widely used}} approach to agent negotiation. A review of <b>auction</b> theory proves that <b>auction</b> revenue is influenced by factors such as the <b>auction</b> format and the <b>auction</b> parameters. The optimal <b>auction</b> format and parameters are dependent on the bidders and the <b>auction</b> environment. A study of internet <b>auctions</b> confirms the findings of <b>auction</b> theory regarding the importance of the format as well as the parameters in an <b>auction.</b> There has been significant research on the strategies bidding agents can adopt in order to maximise their utility. There is little research, however, on the strategies auctioneer agents can adopt to maximise <b>auction</b> revenue. In this study, a survey is done of the related auctioneer agents in research that maximise <b>auction</b> revenue. The shortcomings of these are identified. The aim of this research is to develop an adaptive auctioneer agent that can maximise the revenue of an <b>auction.</b> The proposed solution is the revenue maximising adaptive auctioneer (RMAA) agent. The RMAA agent consists of three components: the <b>auction</b> manager, the <b>auction</b> format selector (AFS) and the <b>auction</b> parameter selector (APS). The AFS employs a customised zeroth-level classifier system to select the <b>auction</b> format based on the <b>auction</b> environment. The APS employs reinforcement learning combined with a local hill climbing algorithm to learn what the most profitable values are for <b>auction</b> parameters, such as the reserve price and the bid increment. The <b>auction</b> manager automates the <b>auction</b> and coordinates the AFS and APS. It implements the four traditional <b>auction</b> formats, namely the English <b>auction,</b> the Dutch <b>auction,</b> the Vickrey <b>auction</b> and the first-price sealed-bid <b>auction.</b> Experiments conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the RMAA agent prove that this agent can consistently generate more revenue than a non-adaptive auctioneer agent. The contribution of this research is an auctioneer agent that adapts both the <b>auction</b> format and the <b>auction</b> parameters according to the environment in order to maximise the <b>auction</b> revenue...|$|R

In a setting without private information, these <b>auctions</b> achieve the maximal revenue as a unique equilibrium in dominant strategies.

40|$|Most <b>auction</b> sellers consign {{property}} to <b>auction</b> houses rather than holding the <b>auction</b> themselves. In addition to charging sellers a commission on property that sells in the <b>auction,</b> many <b>auction</b> houses also specify buy-in penalties in <b>auction</b> contracts. This is an amount the seller must pay the <b>auction</b> house if the property fails {{to sell at}} <b>auction.</b> An important managerial question for <b>auction</b> houses is whether and when buy-in penalties can increase revenues of the <b>auction</b> house, seller, or both, and what combinations of commission and buy-in penalty to use. We show that <b>auctions</b> which combine buy-in penalties with lower commissions Pareto-dominate <b>auctions</b> that use only commissions. This strategy motivates the seller to set a lower reserve, which creates a surplus in <b>auction</b> revenues that can go to one or both parties. This strategy is Pareto-dominant even if the <b>auction</b> house and the seller are uncertain {{about the number of}} bidders at the <b>auction,</b> or the <b>auction</b> house is uncertain about the seller's own valuation for the property, at the time the buy-in penalty, commission, and reserve are contractually set. We also discuss the incentive issues raised by this strategy. <b>auctions,</b> bidding, commissions, pricing, penalty...|$|R
