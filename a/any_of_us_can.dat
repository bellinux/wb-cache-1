In 1991, John Hayden updated Russell Noyes's 1971 biography of Wordsworth and began his analysis of the ode by claiming: [...] "Wordsworth's great 'Ode on Immortality' is not easy to follow nor wholly clear. A basic difficulty of interpretation centers upon what the poet means by 'immortality.'" [...] However, he goes on to declare, [...] "the majority of competent judges acclaim the 'Ode on Immortality' as Wordsworth's most splendid poem. In no other poem are poetic conditions so perfectly fulfilled. There is the right subject, the right imagery to express it, and the right meter and language for both." [...] Thomas McFarland, when emphasising the use of a river as a standard theme in Wordsworth's poems, stated in 1992: [...] "Not only do Wordsworth's greatest statements--'Tintern Abbey', 'The Immortality Ode', 'The Ruined Cottage', 'Michael', the first two books of The Prelude--all overlie a streaming infrashape, but Wordsworth, like the other Romantics, seemed virtually hypnotized by the idea of running water." [...] After analysing the Wordsworth's incorporation of childhood memories into the ode, G. Kim Blank, in 1995, argued, [...] "It is the recognition and finally the acceptance of his difficult feelings that stand behind and in the greatness and power of the Ode, both as a personal utterance and a universal statement. It is no accident that Wordsworth is here most eloquent. Becoming a whole person is the most powerful statement <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> ever made. Wordsworth in the Ode here makes it for us." [...] In 1997, John Mahoney praised the various aspects of the poem while breaking down its rhythm and style. In particular, he emphasised the poem's full title as [...] "of great importance for all who study the poem carefully" [...] and claimed, [...] "The final stanza is a powerful and peculiarly Wordsworthian valediction." ...|$|E

50|$|Like Kant, the {{philosophers}} {{of the twentieth}} century have been wary <b>of</b> ascribing <b>any</b> particular number to the virtues.

40|$|The recent {{controversy}} around certain {{football fans}} incessantly booing Adam Goodes has sparked collective soul-searching as we struggle {{to distinguish the}} line between racism and benign on-field antics. Regardless of {{what we might call}} it, there are things that you can do when you witness behaviour such as this. Goodes being booed while playing football is a very public case of “everyday racism”. Everyday racism is more normalised and less recognised than other more blatant forms of racism, such as calling Goodes an “ape” as a 13 -year-old girl did during a 2013 game in Melbourne. <b>Any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> do something about such instances, but before we go on, here are some provisos. We’re not saying that everybody who booed Goodes was racist. Nor do we consider whether this incident signals a deep-seated national racism as others have argued. What we’re concerned about here is the hurt inflicted through everyday racism and what we, as a community, can do about it...|$|R

'Of her heart,' said Wardle, with a smile, 'you should certainly be the best judge.

We are spared the spectacle, at least, of those who eat and drink too much. We can switch off a bore at once. We can retire when we are fatigued, without leaving a blank space before the others. And all this without saying anything of the higher spiritual and intellectual effect--freed from material grossness of appetite and show--which the dinner party thus attains.

60|$|The human mind, {{lost in a}} maze of inequalities that it cannot {{explain and}} evils that it cannot, singly, remedy, must adapt itself as best it can.

Beyond that we must harden ourselves lest we too perish. We feed well while others starve. We make fast the doors of our lighted houses against the indigent and the hungry. What else can we do?

40|$|A {{potential}} Classic: On Brita Egardt's Hästslakt och rackarskam If ethnologists were to {{put together}} their own list of classic texts, what books should be included, and for what reasons? This question was posed as {{an invitation to a}} workshop at the 30 th Nordic meeting of ethnologists and folklorists in June, 2006, and brought about, in the first place, a little handful of suggested books. This paper presents one of these: Brita Egardt's dissertation "Hästslakt och rackarskam" (app. : The slaughter of horses and the shame of the slaughterer), published in 1962. My suggestion is that this study can {{serve as a model for}} ethnologists because it is extremely cogently thought and argued, and because of its focus, at the end of the analysis, on general social phenomena and processes such as hierarchy, exclusion and stigmatisation. In addition, I reflect on the posthumous reputation of the author of the book, and suggest further reflection on two issues. The first is marginalisation in academic contexts. If such a fate should affect <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> how <b>can</b> it be handled, and how can personal bitterness be avoided? The other issue is academic leadership, which I suggest is a composite phenomenon that ought to be thoroughly rethought...|$|R

40|$|English Abstract I {{chose the}} topic of my thesis, "Protection of victims of crime", because this issue is very topical in recent years, {{not only in terms}} of legislation, it is also an {{important}} topic that affects society. Unfortunately, crime is an integral part <b>of</b> society, and <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> become a victim of crime. Only when a person is affected by crime does he realize how important the protection of victims is. The Czech Republic is a country that does not forget to address this issue, and it comprehensively amended the rights of victims with Act no. 45 / 2013 Coll., On the Protection of Victims of Crime. Legislation on the protection of victims of crime is relatively new, and like many regulations that have no equivalent in the legal system, this law will also be subject to change and improvement over time. Although the victims' Act undoubtedly strengthened victims' rights and moved them to the next level, it has still been criticized for its considerable shortcomings. The prepared amendment to the Act on Victims of Crime, which incorporates the conformity of the given act with EU law and also seeks to incorporate knowledge in exercising victims' rights in practice, is trying to remove this problem at least in part. In my thesis, I focused primarily on the protection of victims' rights, which are [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the eyes}} of his contemporaries, there was little {{question}} that Learned Hand deserved the seat he never won on the Supreme Court. Indeed, he was referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 Tenth Justice, 2 ̆ 2 and much was made of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s deference to some of his Second Circuit opinions. Although Hand never sat on the Supreme Court, he seemed assured of a still loftier place-in the twentieth-century judicial pantheon alongside Holmes, Brandeis, and Cardozo. Hand 2 ̆ 7 s Olympian position was so assured that Chief Judge Charles Clark opened the commemorative celebration of Hand 2 ̆ 7 s fiftieth year on the federal bench by expressing the unworthiness of those present to provide Hand a meaningful tribute: 2 ̆ 2 I shall carefully refrain from saying that we honor him today; who are we or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that we <b>can</b> add any laurels to those the profession, indeed the world, has already bestowed upon him?
