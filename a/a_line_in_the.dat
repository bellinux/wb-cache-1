5|$|The World Is Not Enough (1999) is {{the nineteenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film was directed by Michael Apted, with the original story and screenplay written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The title is taken from <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1963 novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place {{at the peak of the}} February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{area were}} first {{launched}} 1897, {{but not until}} 1914 were the necessary permits granted. The line was built and operated by Ekebergbanen. The line opened in 1917, and connected to the Gamleby Line to reach Stortorvet in the city center. The line differed from the street trams in that it ran {{in its own right}} of way and used 1,200 volt supply, unlike the 600 volts used in the streets. In the early 1930s, the line was rebuilt to double track and a branch, the Simensbråten Line, was built. The Ekeberg Line was extended to its current terminus in 1941. In 1948, the company was taken over by the municipal Oslo Sporveier and operations were integrated in 1965. The line was nearly closed in 1967 and 1973, but during the 1970s, the line received new rolling stock and a renovation. Future plans include an extension to Hauketo Station on the Østfold Line and a new route via Bjørvika to the city center.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} a light rail along {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line were {{launched}} by Holmenkolbanen in 1904. They called for a branch from Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line to Geitmyren and onwards to Sagene. The next proposal for a line was launched in 1917, when Aker Municipality established the company Akersbanerne. It started work planning the Østensjø Line as well as the Sognsvann Line. The neighborhoods of Sogn and Tåsen were being built, and the municipality wanted to establish a good transport system to make the areas more attractive. Holmenkolbanen stated that they should be prioritized to build the system, since they already had <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, but the municipality wanted to have political control over the development of the area.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind <b>a</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of horizontal jumps, that {{line is a}} straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

25|$|In modern mathematics, {{given the}} {{multitude}} of geometries, {{the concept of a}} line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described.

This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom, which is pure rotation about the axis of the hinge.|$|E
