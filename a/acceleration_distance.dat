Truck acceleration performance {{data were collected}} through a video-based data collection method. A piecewise constant acceleration model was employed to capture truck acceleration characteristics.

At the taper type ramp that has limited <b>acceleration</b> <b>distance,</b> acceleration profile indicated a decreasing trend with distance. While for the ramp with an auxiliary lane that has sufficient <b>acceleration</b> <b>distance,</b> {{it was found that the}} acceleration behavior is to have a high acceleration rate in the beginning, then acceleration rate decrease with speed increase, and high acceleration rate again as drivers approach the merging area. Field data show that the truck acceleration performance data documented in the ITE’s (Institute of Transportation Engineers) “Traffic Engineering Handbook” are much lower than the field collected data. Also, based on the regression analysis of speed versus distance profiles, it was found that the AASHTO’s (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) Green Book acceleration length design guidance is insufficient to accommodate trucks at metered on-ramps. The required acceleration lengths for medium and heavy trucks are approximately 1. 3 and 1. 6 times of the Green Book design guideline, respectively...|$|E
