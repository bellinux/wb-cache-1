5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August 1986 {{a victim}} was found {{buried in a}} {{depression}} of earth in the grounds of a collective farm {{in the city of}} Bataysk. The wounds inflicted upon this victim did seem to bear the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Pogoryelova's body bore all the trademark mutilations of the previous victims: her body had been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body, some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} , voiced by Yurika Hino and voiced again by Jennifer Hale in the English distribution. At the {{beginning}} of the series, she is consumed by the Phoenix Force and nearly destroys the world with her tremendous strength and power. The X-Men engage in a brief battle with her, until she ultimately sacrifices herself to save the world. Although she apparently dies, she assists the X-Men with conflicts through a strong telepathic link in later episodes, such as saving Professor X from hallucinations, and appears as the White Phoenix of the Crown, encouraging the X-Men to keep on fighting to save the world. She was in a strong and close romantic relationship with Cyclops, and had a necklace with a ruby stone with gold {{in the shape of a}} phoenix, which was a gift from Cyclops. The necklace was then given to Hisako as a sign that Cyclops can finally let Jean go, as he recognizes her sacrifice as a symbol of love for her friends and the world. Her Dark Phoenix persona is taken from X-Men: The Last Stand where her face is full of dark veins <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> become entirely black.|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{attempting}} {{to capture a}} realistic portrayal of the three, Utamaro idealizes their likenesses. [...] To many viewers, the faces in this and other portraits of the time seem little individuated, or perhaps not at all. Others emphasize the subtle differences that distinguish the three in {{the shapes of the}} mouths, noses, and eyes: [...] Kita has plump cheeks and an innocent expression; her eyes are almond-shaped, and the bridge of her nose high; [...] Hisa has a stiffer, proud expression, and the bridge of Hisa's nose is lower <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> rounder than Kita's; [...] Toyohina's features fall in between, and she has an air of being older and more intellectual.|$|E

[...] The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, the same technique which was used for Rihanna's previous single's artwork, [...] "We Found Love". [...] "You da Ones artwork displays the singer with her head tilted back <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed holding a cigarette between her lips.

500|$|A mutant {{former member}} of the X-Men, a Class 5 mutant who {{possesses}} potentially limitless telepathic and telekinetic powers. The X-Men learn that she has survived the flooding dam from the previous film, but {{when the rest of the}} team finds her, Grey has given in completely to her aggressive alternate personality of her powers, the Phoenix. Her mutant powers rival those of Xavier. The writers described the multiple personalities was [...] "an Oedipal drama played out", where the Phoenix was [...] "someone embodying [...] Greek goddess" [...] , while Jean Grey kept the character as [...] "a human, grounded in Freudian terms, a victim, a schizophrenic. To mark the change of Jean Grey into Phoenix, her wardrobe focused on red colors, and everyday fabric in contrast to the leather costumes of the X-Men. Digital make-up also made Jean's face darker with her skin showing some veins <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> turning black, signifying the Phoenix personality of her powers.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{were made}} {{as early as}} 1937 by Walt Disney to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, [...] "The Snow Queen", into a film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, {{who served as the}} basis for Princess Anna, and the other named Kai, who is [...] "cursed with negativity" [...] after his heart is pierced with a shard of glass from an enchanted mirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow Queen. However, Disney {{struggled}} with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy tale's title character, who was intended to be a villain. In the story, she is described as [...] "a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair and beautiful, but made of ice—shining and glittering ice. Still she was alive <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> sparkled like bright stars, but there was neither peace nor rest in their glance." [...] Disney was unable {{to find a way to}} make the Snow Queen more real and eventually abandoned film plans.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} September 1843, Mary Shelley {{proposed}} to her publisher, Edward Moxon, that she write a travel book based on her 1840 and 1842 Continental journeys. Interested in assisting Gatteschi, she wrote to Moxon that she was writing [...] "for a purpose most urgent & desirable". She described the work as [...] "light", [...] "personal", and [...] "amusing". Moxon agreed to her proposal and advanced her £60, which she promised to return if fewer than 300copies of the work were sold. (She subsequently gave this same amount to Gatteschi.) By the end of January 1844, Shelley had already completed most of the first volume. As Sunstein writes, [...] "once started on Rambles, she worked fast and with pleasure, but her head and nerves were bad at times, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> got so weak and inflamed that she wrote only until noon." [...] She left Paris {{at the end of}} January and returned to London, still infatuated with Gatteschi. The death of Sir Timothy Shelley, Percy Florence's grandfather, in April 1844, delayed the completion of the work. However, with material from Gatteschi on the Ancona uprising of 1831 and research help from German-speaking friends, Shelley finished. The text was largely drawn from correspondence written during her travels to her step-sister Claire Clairmont. Mary Shelley's last published work, which was dedicated to the travel writer and poet Samuel Rogers, came out on 1 August 1844.|$|E
500|$|Apollonia and Sofie Agnesh Bojakshiya are fortunetellers in a mother-daughter act at the carnival. Although Apollonia is catatonic, she and Sofie can {{communicate}} telepathically. Their original biographies declare Apollonia a [...] "once renowned seer who read cards {{for the rich}} and famous" [...] and [...] "the only psychic Houdini was unable to debunk." [...] A series of seizures during Sofie's birth in 1913 was given as reason for Apollonia's state. Apollonia's sister cared for her until Sofie was old enough to take over, and they began working the traveling circuits shortly afterwards. It remains unknown until late in season 2 that Sofie is the Omega, although the character's importance for the show's mythology is suggested much earlier. When the series starts with Ben joining the carnival, Apollonia can no longer shield Sofie from her own true self. Sofie begins to evade and rebel against her mother's mental control, but Apollonia counters by first trying to drive Sofie to suicide, then by attempting to kill her in a trailer fire {{at the end of the}} first season. Jonesy rescues Sofie, but Apollonia dies. Nevertheless, season 2 shows Apollonia repeatedly appearing to Sofie and snake charmer Ruthie. Sofie tries to leave her fortuneteller life behind by becoming a roustabout. After a short-lived relationship with Ben, Sofie leaves the carnival altogether and becomes the Crowes' maid in California. Brother Justin introduces her to the world of religion, but several signs suggest the preacher is not the good man Sofie thought. After berating Brother Justin in the final episode, Sofie is locked in a barn where visions insinuate her as the Omega and Brother Justin as her father. She later shoots Jonesy, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> have taken on the coal black appearance of Brother Justin's eyes. The final minutes of the series show Sofie finding Brother Justin dead in a cornfield. She lays her hands on his chest, and the corn around them dies.|$|E

2500|$|Aspects of Lois' {{personality}} {{have varied}} over the years, {{depending on the}} comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations, Lois has been depicted as a smart, determined, strong-willed and independent person.

In the 1990s, when the television series [...] began airing, Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress Teri Hatcher <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were typically violet to match her character on [...] Traditionally in the comics, the character has been shown with black hair, however, from the late 1980s through the '90s, Lois was depicted with auburn hair.

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{carved from}} a single block of white Carrara marble – a rare medium for Giambologna. The surface is highly finished and in good condition aside from some drill and rasp marks. It depicts a nude young woman {{in the act of}} washing, seated in an awkward position on a truncated column. She is voluptuous and fleshy in the usual Mannerist way. She has a blank, inscrutable expression, and wavy, centrally-parted hair. Her straight nose reflects classical Roman sculpture. There is a bracelet on her left arm, and a chemise or shift with embroidered cuffs is draped across her left thigh. The woman's pose is complex, with her weight resting mostly on her left buttock, which is seated on a round column from which drapery hangs. According to art historian Peggy Fogelman, [...] "With one leg and both arms positioned in front of her, the figure's weight and the compositional balance seem tilted forward". Her left leg is raised; her knee sharply bent. The head is inclined downwards, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> are blank. She holds an ointment jar in her left hand, raised high above her head.
