500|$|Polonium {{was also}} part of brushes or more complex tools that {{eliminate}} static charges in photographic plates, textile mills, paper rolls, sheet plastics, and on substrates (such as automotive) prior to the application of coatings. Alpha particles emitted by polonium ionize air molecules that neutralize charges on the nearby surfaces. Some <b>anti-static</b> brushes contain up to [...] of 210Po {{as a source of}} charged particles for neutralizing static electricity. In the US, the devices with no more than [...] of (sealed) 210Po per unit can be bought in any amount under a [...] "general license", which means that a buyer need not be registered by any authorities. Polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half-life; it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous beta particle sources.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anti-static</b> finish {{prevents}} {{dust from}} {{clinging to the}} fabric. <b>Anti-static</b> effective chemicals are largely chemically inert and require Thermasol or heat treatment for fixing on polyester fabrics. Polyether agents {{have been found to}} be useful but should not affect the dye-equilibrium on fiber, lest they impair the rubbing fastness. In general, Thermasol <b>anti-static</b> agents also have a good soil release action, which is as permanent as the <b>anti-static</b> effect. <b>Anti-static</b> finishes may also be of polyamide type, being curable at moderate temperatures.|$|E
