A total of 167,500 acres, or approximately {{two thirds of}} the county's area, is forested land. Large portions of the southwestern part of the county are forested. 34% of the county's land is undeveloped, most of which (60,000 acres) is unused land.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylloxera}} {{epidemic in}} the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside. In place of these vines, <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} area {{was part of}} the manor of Moston, near the now demolished Moston Hall. It was owned by Sir Edward Tootal Broadhurst, a local industrialist, who in 1920 donated 80 <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land for use as a park, as a recognition of victory in the First World War.|$|E
50|$|The {{rice fields}} {{played a major}} role in the 19th century life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canals, banks, and trunks have been {{maintained}} on Hobcaw Barony. About 325 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alderley and Oryzantia, 300 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Youngfield and Bellefield, 50 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Strawberry Hill, and 800 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Michaux and Calais Plantations remain.

50|$|The Ponil Complex Fire {{started on}} June 2, 2002 and burned until June 17. The burn zone covered 92000 acre total; 28000 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> Philmont, 4000 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baker Wildlife Area, 25000 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Valle Vidal, 20000 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WS Ranch and 15000 <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UU Bar Ranch. One third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burn zone was totally burned while another third was only lightly to {{moderately}} burned. About one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burn zone escaped relatively unharmed, due to being sections <b>of</b> valleys that <b>the</b> fire jumped over or being not as dried out {{and likely to}} burn because of nearby water.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area {{inhabited}} predominantly {{by people of}} African descent, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), {{to make room for}} a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.|$|E
5|$|Reservoirs {{and ponds}} in the {{watershed}} of Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir, and Maple Lake. The first three {{are used as}} drinking water reservoirs and the lakes also serve as flood protection. The Pennsylvania American Water Company owns all four lakes and several hundred <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding land. There are flood levees {{at the mouth of}} the stream. There is some evidence of coal mining on a ridge overlooking the area in the stream's vicinity. However, residential encroachment on the stream's floodplain is a more significant environmental concern.|$|E
5|$|San Marco, which {{eventually}} gave {{its name to}} the former area of South Jacksonville, broke ground in 1925 as the city's most ambitious development. It was constructed over 80 <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Villa Alexandria estate, which had deteriorated after Martha Reed Mitchell's death in 1902. The developer was Telfair Stockton, who had previously established the exclusive Avondale neighborhood {{on the other side of}} the river. San Marco, designed as a fashionable, upscale development in keeping with Villa Alexandria's reputation, comprised 250 lots and a commercial district. It was remarkably successful from the beginning; apparently driven by land speculation, San Marco shattered local records by selling every lot within three hours of putting them up for sale, even though very little work had begun.|$|E

5|$|Waller owned 20 percent (900 <b>acres)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land in Bloomsburg {{at various}} times during his life, {{which is more than}} any other person has held in the town to date. He also owned land in other parts of Columbia County and the Wyoming Valley. his lands in Bloomsburg {{primarily}} included northeastern, southeastern, and south-central Bloomsburg, but also included some small areas of land near Bloomsburg's border with Hemlock Township. He sold some of his land, but also donated parts of it by selling those areas for $1.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh's {{importance}} as a Civil War battle, {{coupled with the}} lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development {{as one of the first}} five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. Government involvement eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 acres at Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saved land had been preserved. Private preservation organizations stepped in to fill the void. The Civil War Trust became the primary agent of these efforts, preserving 1,158 acres at Shiloh since its inception. The land preserved by the Trust at Shiloh included tracts over which Confederate divisions passed as they fought Grant's men on the battle's first day and their retreat during the Union counteroffensive on day two. A 2012 campaign focused in particular on a section of land which was part of the Confederate right flank on day one and on several tracts which were part of the Battle of Fallen Timbers.|$|E
5|$|After the Terhunes died, Sunnybank slowly deteriorated, {{with the}} house {{and much of the}} grounds destroyed. Large chunks of the {{property}} were sold by the Albert Payson Terhune, Inc, an organization set up in the wills of Bert and Anice Terhune to provide funds for a charitable organization, the Terhune Foundation. The last ten <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property were eventually sold to a housing developer, which included the house, graves of the Terhune collies, and the dogs' old kennels. In 1967, this remaining chunk of Sunnybank was condemned by the Wayne Township. The next year, the township made the remaining acres a historical park, Terhune Memorial Park. The Van Riper-Hopper Historic House Museum, located several miles away, displays Terhune's writings, the awards won by the Sunnybank collies, and other memorabilia. The graves of Lad, Wolf, Lady, and the other Sunnybank dogs are preserved there and available for viewing by visitors. Clippings of Lad's coat are stored at the Library of Congress, having been donated by Anice. Annual gatherings to Sunnybank are organized by the Collie Health Foundation on the third weekend in August, during which speakers familiar with Terhune and his dogs speak, seminars and tours are conducted, and various collie-focused events and competitions are conducted. In 2005, Marilyn R. Horowitz published a Sunnybank calendar, the proceeds of which were used by the Terhune Sunnybank Memorial to restore Lad's grave, which had fallen into disrepair, and to aid in maintaining the grounds of Sunnybank.|$|E
