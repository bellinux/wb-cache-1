40|$|My {{research}} project focusses meaning-making resources made available in literacy education. A social semiotic (Halliday, Mathiessen 2014, Kress, van Leuween 2006) and sociological (Bernstein 2000) framework is {{employed in the}} exploration of these resources and how they help shaping the consciousness of young readers. The project examines current textbooks in mother tongue and second language education, as well as classroom practice. The study of Swedish language textbooks shows that they restrict themselves to general descriptions of narrative fields and rigid delineations of text structure. The study proposes that the readerâ€™s ability to fruitfully engage with these fields can be increased by closer attention to the play of linguistic resources in the modelled texts, unveiled by systemic-functional and genre-theoretical analysis (Martin, Rose 2008). The ongoing study of unfolding discourse in a multi-ethnic first grade classroom examines the resources used in guiding these students into narrative worlds. A special interest is invested in how the teacher introduces fictional <b>aid</b> <b>characters</b> during joint-reading sessions as a playful way to model reading strategies. This apprenticing of emergent, multilingual readers is analyzed through a synthesis of functional linguistic and sociological tools (Christie 1998), cementing a sociocultural view of literacy teaching practices...|$|R

5000|$|The game {{is similar}} in both basic {{gameplay}} and visuals to Diablo series. However, there is no leveling system, meaning {{that the only way}} to increase player's attributes is by collecting rings, drinking special stat-raising potions, and simply using more powerful weapons and better armour. Four classes are available to play: warrior, barbarian, dwarf, and elf, all with the same abilities, but each especially good at one. Clans is split into seven stages, with the seventh being mostly the boss stage. Each stage is divided into many sectors, or [...] "rooms", that player visits. During the game, the player is often tasked with solving a riddle or puzzle, or helping a friendly character. Also present are point-and-click graphic games elements, such as inventory, an ability to use items with objects or characters. While there is no town in-game, the player encounters several quest-giving or simply <b>aiding</b> <b>characters</b> (like wizard, old woman, blacksmith, chef, witch, cursed warrior) and a trader along the way. Some of the main characters' quotes are presented in a humorous style. The player can find and equip 5 attribute-boosting rings, and use swords, axes, shields, and armor of five types each (though there are only four axes). The main point of gameplay is navigate through the stage, finding better equipment and health potions in order to cure the wounds received from monsters, which ranges from the weak goblin-like humanoids and trolls to the most dangerous black mages and knights.|$|R
