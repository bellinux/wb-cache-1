50|$|In April 2005, the PARKnSHOP chain, {{including}} the rebranded TASTE superstore in Festival Walk, controversially dismissed 525 employees, {{when the company}} outsourced the labour for its fresh foods counter; most of the employees were dismissed just before the Chinese New Year in 2006. The <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employees</b> included many low-paid workers of longtime service. The employees' union complained that although 90% of the dismissed workers were rehired at {{the same position as}} before, their wages were lowered (some reportedly by as much as 44%), and their working hours were increased from 10 to 12 hours by the outsourcing subcontractor. The resulting average hourly rate was HK$18.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 2016, EDMC's legal perils had ensnared {{even the}} company's outside legal counsel at the Pittsburgh-based global law firm Reed Smith LLP. Advised by Attorney Katherine Ryan before two federal judges in {{discrimination}} lawsuits dating to August 2012, the company was defeated when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a sweeping October 18 order invalidating an alternative dispute resolution policy superimposed retroactively on the company's employees; EDMC had tried to bar <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employees</b> from filing suit in any court for any purpose. The 3-0 panel found that the policy had been illegally superimposed without employees' assent and thereby reinstated a pair of federal cases against the Art Institute of Pittsburgh demanding more than $4 million in damages and alleging legal malpractice inside EDMC.|$|R
40|$|The Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) arguably allows non-U. S. {{citizens}} to bring claims {{for violations of}} customary international law (CIL). Although CIL litigation typically embraces only egregious human rights violations, the scope of CIL actually encompasses all universally recognized rights, including some labor rights. This Comment explores {{the possibility that the}} ATCA may be used to litigate claims by non-U. S. citizens alleging violations of international labor rights. It concludes that the Act likely provides a vehicle for <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employees</b> to bring suit in U. S. court for violations of international labor standards. Finally, this Comment recognizes that the impact of ATCA litigation may be more beneficial than detrimental to owners of small businesses. By holding U. S. and other employers operating in developing nations to an international labor standard, the ATCA may act {{to level the playing field}} between domestic companies and companies operating abroad...|$|R
5000|$|The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) {{provides}} that all employees {{have the right}} to full pay for forty hours of work in any given week. Laura Symczyk, a nurse working for Genesis HealthCare, alleged that her employer would regularly dock thirty minutes of pay per shift for its employees as meal time, regardless of whether the employee actually took a meal break. Under the FLSA, an <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employee</b> can sue not only on her own behalf, but on behalf of all co-workers who have similarly been injured. This is called a [...] "collective action," [...] which is roughly (but not completely) similar to a class action.|$|E
40|$|Local authorities, {{like most}} employers, are often {{asked to give}} {{references}} in respect of employees who are moving to new jobs. Whilst most still partake in this practice care needs to be taken. Bad references are becoming a growth area of litigation. Options for an <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employee,</b> if economic loss results from a damaging reference, include a claim for defamation, malicious falsehood, discrimination or harassment. Whilst it may be good employment practice, contrary to popular belief, there is no legal obligation on employers to supply references in respect of employees. The only successful cases based on a failure to give references have been where refusal was ancillary to allegations of racial or sexual discrimination e. g. in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd. (1998) However {{what is clear is}} that once an employer decides to give a reference then it owes a duty to the employee in respect of the contents of the reference. Caselaw in the last few years has confirmed this. In Spring v Guardian Assurance [1994] Lord Woolf stated that references should be "based on facts revealed after making those reasonably careful enquiries which, in the circumstances, a reasonably carefu...|$|E
40|$|This {{treatise}} specifically explores section 198 of the Labour Relations Act, 66 of 1995, which regulate {{temporary employment}} service. However, before one can assess this section in particular, other legislation {{has to be}} considered dealing with temporary employment services, {{read in conjunction with}} the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 (hereinafter the “Constitution”), as all legislation is subject thereto. As summarised by Navsa AJ in the judgment of Sidumo& Another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd & Others: “The starting point is the Constitution. Section 23 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 provides that everyone has the right to fair labour practices”. The Labour Relations Act, 66 of 1995 (hereinafter the “LRA”) is also subject to the Constitution, and section 198 has to be evaluated and assessed against the Constitution as is set out in section 1 of the LRA, which provides that: “The purpose of this Act is to advance economic development, social justice, labour peace and the democratisation of the workplace by fulfilling the primary objects of this Act, which are (a) to give effect to and regulate the fundamental rights conferred by section 27 of the Constitution [...] . ” The LRA was drafted while the Interim Constitution was in effect, this being the reason why section 1 (a) refers to section 27 of the Constitution, the Interim Constitution, and not the final Constitution, which was enacted in 1996. The Honourable Justice Conradie held in NAPTOSA & others v Minister of Education, Western Cape & others [2001] 22 ILJ 889 (C) : “that the effect of section 1 (a) is to ensure that the LRA “[marries] the enforcement of fundamental rights with the effective resolution of labour dispute temporary employment service... If an employer adopts a labour practice which is thought to be unfair, an <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employee</b> would in the first instance be obliged to seek a remedy under the LRA. If he or she finds no remedy under that Act, the LRA might come under constitutional scrutiny for not giving adequate protection to a constitutional right. If a labour practice permitted by the LRA is not fair, a court might be persuaded to strike down the impugned provision. But it would, I think, need a good deal of persuasion”. The Constitution and the LRA lay the basis for temporary employment services in the South African law context, and are the primary laws dealing with this topic. Although the main focus of the treatise is section 198 of the LRA in dealing with temporary employment services, it is evident that secondary labour legislation also regulates temporary employment services. It is noteworthy that each piece of legislation has different requirements and/or essentials regulating temporary employment services, even though some of the legislation have very similar provisions. Secondly, each of the pieces of legislation also determines and attaches different meanings to who the real employer is. This is important so as to establish who, as between the temporary employment service and its client, may be held liable for obligations arising out of the employment relationship. A tripartite relationship is created by temporary employment service arrangements, in that there is the temporary employment services –client relationship, the temporary employment service’s employer - employee relationship and the client –employee relationship, each with its own rights, obligations, and requirements for termination. A further focus of the treatise is the problems experienced in the employment relationship between the temporary employment service and its employees and the termination of the relationship. The difficulties and potential unfairness arising from termination {{of the relationship between the}} temporary employment service and its employees have resulted in legislative developments and proposed amendments, most notably the repeal of section 198. These proposals are discussed herein, including the question of whether section 198 should be repealed, or whether temporary employment services should be more strenuously regulated in order to resolve the problems being experienced with the application of section 198 in its present form. It is proposed in conclusion that temporary employment services be more strenuously regulated, as the repeal of section 198 will not be socially and economically beneficial to the workforce of South Africa, nor the Labour Market. Further, it would be contrary to the Constitution and purpose of the Labour Relations Ac...|$|E
40|$|Many {{employees}} feel {{a general}} sense of unfairness toward their supervisors. A common reaction to such unfairness is {{to talk about it}} with coworkers. The conventional wisdom is that this unfairness talk should be beneficial to the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employees.</b> After all, talking provides employees with an opportunity {{to make sense of the}} experience and to “let off steam. ” We challenge this perspective, drawing on cognitive-motivational-relational theory to develop arguments that unfairness talk leads to emotions that reduce the employee’s ability to move on from the unfairness. We first tested these proposals in a three-wave, two-source field study of bus drivers (Study 1), then replicated our findings in a laboratory study (Study 2). In both studies we found that unfairness talk was positively related to anger and negatively related to hope. Those emotions went on to have direct effects on forgiveness and indirect effects on citizenship behavior. Our results also showed that the detrimental effects of unfairness talk were neutralized when the listener offered suggestions that reframed the unfair situation. We discuss the implications of these results for managing unfairness in organizations...|$|R
40|$|Texte intégral disponible sur JSTOR : [URL] audienceThis article {{examines}} the normative repertoire used by Chinese workers to interpret the reality they face, focusing on the sense of injustice expressed by workers addressing two different institutions: arbitration committees (zhongcai weiyuanhui) and Letters and Visits Offices (xinfangke). The data used consist of files selected from {{the archives of the}} Labour Bureau of the Shenzhen municipal government. Each of the two institutions serves a somewhat different constituency of <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employees.</b> The arbitration committees are resorted to most frequently by employees with some financial means and standing, while the Letters and Visits Offices are turned to more frequently by groups of marginalized, impoverished workers. For this latter group, the Offices provide not just a means to challenge specific violations of their legal rights, but more than this, to focus on the political and social norms they believe should be applicable to the workplace. Such arguments are often expressed in appeals that focus on diverse state regulations, and the state has been brought under pressure to act in conformity with these...|$|R

40|$|Discrimination {{cases and}} {{lawsuits}} are causing anxiety for many employers, managers and {{employees in the}} United States and are driving many good employees to courts or other organizations. One of the greatest fears of company officials and individual managers is the likelihood of either being sued for something {{that they have done}} intentionally or unintentionally, or for something that they should have considered doing but did not. One form of discrimination that has become widespread deals with age. Age discrimination in the workplace impacts people of all sizes, races, colors, religions, and ethnicities. It is no secret that age-related lawsuits proliferated during the last few years’ recession and more recently age related claims have been on the rise as some of the layoffs seem to have been targeting older workers. Juries often side with <b>aggrieved</b> <b>employees,</b> even if the evidence is flimsy. Because of these trends, companies and their managers are realizing the need to protect their firms by periodically reviewing workforce diversity and proactively analyzing their work environment for latent signs of discrimination. A cultural perspective of aging is discussed in the enclosed document along with the societal norms and perceptions of aging from the perspective of people in Afghanistan, Turkey, Jamaica, and the United States. Also, the concept of “unearned privilege” is discussed as it applies to age in different cultures. The focus of this material is discrimination based on age in order to create awareness and reduce the negative impact of stereotypes associated with “older workers. ” It is imperative that older workers are kept in the American workforce as long as possible, as there will be a shortage of skilled labor as early as 2005, if older workers continue to retire early...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} that section 186 (1) (b) of the Labour Relations Act makes no changes to the common law with regard to factors or circumstances that give rise to a right to renewal of a fixed term contract of employment. The reason for this is that what an <b>aggrieved</b> fixed term <b>employee</b> needs to prove in order to have his or her contract renewed (usually for an indefinite period), irrespective of whether the claim is based on common law or legislation, is essentially the same. The outcome is always determined by an application of the principles of fairness or reasonableness. A subjective belief or expectation, based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of the state of affairs in the light of the conduct of the employer in the surrounding circumstances, gives rise to a right of renewal in terms of both the common law and in terms of section 186 (1) (b) of the Labour Relations Act. Secondly, the {{purpose of this}} article is to demonstrate that a claim for renewal of a fixed term contract on a permanent basis should be possible in terms of the Labour Relations Act if this would be fair and reasonable in the surrounding circumstances...|$|R
