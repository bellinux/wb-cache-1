500|$|During the off-season, the World Hockey Association, a major {{professional}} league {{proposed to}} rival the NHL, held an Entry Draft on July 17, 2004. Holding the first overall selection, Toronto chose Crosby. The following month, {{it was reported}} that Crosby turned down a US$7.5million deal over three years to play for Hamilton. Crosby told reporters that while [...] "it took <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to that much money", he [...] "work hard most of his life to play in the NHL." [...] The deal would have paid him $2.5 million annually and an additional $2 million payout regardless of whether the WHA was realized as a legitimate league or not. It was not clarified, however, how Hamilton could have signed Crosby, as Toronto held his WHA rights. Nevertheless, the WHA never materialized.|$|E
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of."

500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

But also, as a Christian, I've got <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just about life in general ...

In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek [...] "He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter.

But Meehl had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> His book presented three challenges {{to the study of}} judgment that have received scant attention. Psychologists have to develop (a) context-specific models of judgment, (b) non-linear process models that take into account the bounded nature of judgment, and (c) clinician-friendly actuarial methods.

5000|$|The lone mixed review {{came from}} Alex [...] "Tincan" [...] Caldwell of Jesus Freak Hideout, who rated the album two-and-a-half-out-of-five-stars, and {{highlighted}} {{that the two}} highlights from the album are [...] "Nothing Between" [...] and [...] "Picture of Grace". However, Caldwell wrote that [...] "Those tunes are unfortunately among Runs few highlights. The bevy of similar sounding, though watered down, tunes that remain--with unimaginative titles like Pray, Promises, Thats Life and We Will Never Give Up--sound like crowd-sourced greeting card sentiments with middle-of-the-road pop rock backdrops. Sanctus Real has demonstrated {{in the past that}} they are capable of writing hooky, yet thought-provoking songs with heart, and with almost three years between albums, it seems like Matt Hammitt and company could have come up with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> than is evidenced on Run." ...|$|R

In other words, in the absence of real data, they will make up a number.

2500|$|Hamlett was {{receptive}} to dissenting {{views about the}} progress of the war, most notably arranging for Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).

And they were so different that I wanted him to brief the Chiefs." [...] On his own authority, Hamlett scheduled the briefing for July 8, 1963, but it was canceled at the last minute by Army chief of staff Earle G. Wheeler at the behest of JCS chairman Maxwell D. Taylor, whose protégé, General Paul D. Harkins, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, was producing the optimistic reports that Vann's briefing was intended to contradict.|$|E

Jonah Krakow of IGN gave the episode a 9.7 calling it [...] "Incredible" [...] and also stated [...] "Most sitcoms don't {{have as many}} water-cooler moments as serialized adventure shows like Lost or 24, but I know this episode of Community will be an exception." [...] Jason Hughes gave the episode a positive review saying [...] "Like most action movies, there isn't <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the plot.

2500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} albums and an EP, Samhain was signed {{to a major}} label by Rubin {{and the name of}} the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes. Danzig {{discussed}} the reasoning behind the name change: “Rick [...] convinced me it was the way to go, and would also provide me with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more artistic freedom. After all, I was now in charge of where we were going musically, so if I didn't want to do something, it was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so." [...] Danzig's intention at the time was for each album he recorded to consist of a different recording line-up, allowing him to keep working with different musicians. The original band consisted of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and former Circle Jerks–DOA–Black Flag drummer Chuck Biscuits.|$|R

2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and I write about it all...I figured I had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and there were so many things I wanted to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E

They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it.
