5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Storm Barbara over the Bahamas on August11. It intensified {{as it moved}} north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane by the next day, and reaching peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) just south of Cape Hatteras on August13. Barbara moved over the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August15. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August16.|$|E

5|$|A system {{developed}} {{within a}} convergence zone on January20 near {{the boundary between}} the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> toward the south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak intensity}} for 36hours, Oliwa gradually weakened as {{it continued to}} the west-northwest, during which it passed through the Northern Marianas Islands. On September14, the typhoon slowed {{to the north of}} Okinawa, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> to the northeast toward Japan. As a weakened typhoon, Oliwa moved ashore on Makurazaki, Kagoshima, Kyushu with winds of 85mph (140km/h) late on September15. It weakened to tropical storm strength while crossing Japan, and deteriorated further to tropical depression status on September16. On September17, the JTWC issued the final advisory on Oliwa while it was in the eastern portion of the Sea of Japan. The JMA maintained advisories as the storm crossed northern Japan, and it accelerated over the open Pacific Ocean. On September19, Oliwa dissipated near the International Date Line to the south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Bingiza was {{the only}} named storm to make {{landfall}} in the inactive 2010–11 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The second of three storms, Bingiza developed on February9 to the northeast of Madagascar. For a few days it meandered generally southwestward, failing to intensify significantly. On February12, the storm began a steady westward track as environmental conditions became more favorable. In a 24‑hour period, Bingiza developed from a moderate tropical storm into an intense tropical cyclone with a well-defined eye. After attaining peak 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph), the cyclone moved ashore in northeastern Madagascar on February14 and quickly weakened as it crossed the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weak tropical disturbance, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> southward to move across western Madagascar. Bingiza attained tropical storm status before making its final landfall near Morondava, dissipating on February18.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Henri {{continued}} to intensify as it tracked through the Bay of Campeche. On September 17, the storm turned northwestward after the ridge to its north weakened, and {{later that day}} Henri reached hurricane status; six hours later, it reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) about 150miles (245km) northeast of Veracruz. Subsequently, a broad low pressure area developed over the western Gulf of Mexico, causing the motion of Henri to become erratic. On September 18, the cyclone began a steady weakening trend, {{believed to have been}} caused by land interaction and the funneling of moisture toward a developing disturbance near the Texas coast. Henri turned eastward on September 19 and weakened to tropical depression status. It failed to regain significant convection, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> northeastward along an extended cold front. On September 24, Henri merged with the frontal trough in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Cobb {{announced}} his retirement after a 22-year career as a Tiger in November 1926, and headed home to Augusta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Tris Speaker also retired as player-manager of the Cleveland Indians.

25|$|For a long time, lattice {{simulations}} {{seemed to}} indicate that the modified gluon and ghost propagators proposed by Gribov and Zwanziger were correct. In 2007, however, computers had become sufficiently strong to probe the region of low momenta, where the propagators are most modified, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out that the Gribovndash&Zwanziger picture is not correct. Instead, the gluon propagator goes to a constant value when the momentum is taken to zero, and the ghost propagator still goes like 1/k2 at low momenta. This is the case for both 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. A solution to this discrepancy has been proposed, adding condensates to the Gribovndash&Zwanziger action.|$|E

25|$|Asus {{was founded}} in Taipei in 1989 by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao, all four having {{previously}} worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies {{would have to wait}} for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to the legend, the company created a prototype for a motherboard using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with their motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out that Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.|$|E

25|$|Science and {{mathematics}} in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models {{and modes of}} funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was al-Khawarizmi. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times {{is that they were}} often polymaths. Examples include the work on optics, maths and astronomy of Ibn al-Haytham.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{reported}} to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia. Johnson and two U.S. Army officers {{went to the}} 22nd Bomb Group base, which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea. Johnson's roommate was an army second lieutenant who was a B-17 bomber pilot. On June 9, 1942, Johnson volunteered as an observer for an air strike mission on New Guinea by eleven B-26 bombers that included his roommate in another plane. While on the mission, his roommate and his crew's B-26 bomber was shot down {{with none of the}} eight men surviving the crash into the water. Reports vary on what happened to the B-26 bomber carrying Johnson during that mission. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro accepts Johnson's account, and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned: the aircraft was attacked, disabling one engine, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> back before reaching its objective, though remaining under heavy fire. Others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire. This is said to be supported by official flight records.|$|E
25|$|This time, Rytas, led by Renaldas Seibutis and Martynas Gecevičius, was {{successful}} – it won {{three games in}} a row (against VEF Rīga, EWE Oldenburg and Telenet Oostende), and qualified for the Euroleague. To strengthen the team roster before Euroleague games, Lietuvos rytas signed former NBA and Lithuania national team player Darius Songaila. On 18 October 2013, Lietuvos rytas started the 2013–14 Euroleague season with a 84–83 victory against Panathinaikos Athens after Renaldas Seibutis's winning shot in overtime. The game was named as the Euroleague's Game of the Week and re-broadcast in over 150 countries worldwide. However, after this, the level of play for the Lithuanian team dropped significantly and Rytas was not able to win any more games. 6 games were lost by 10 points or more <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out to be worst Lietuvos rytas season ever in Euroleague. Following the fiasco, coach Dirk Bauermann was replaced by Croat Aleksandar Petrović. The change helped and on 22 December 2013, Rytas crushed its rival Žalgiris with the result 90–58. After being eliminated in the Eurocup playoffs by KK Crvena zvezda, Lietuvos rytas also sufered a shocking defeat in the LKF Cup finals, losing to BC Prienai 91–92, leading to the firing of coach Aleksandar Petrović, who was replaced by Dainius Adomaitis.|$|E
