25|$|THE NATION AND ITS LAND: Israel {{conquered the}} land with the sword. There it became <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation</b> and only there it will be reborn. Hence Israel alone {{has a right to}} that land. This is an {{absolute}} right. It has never expired and never will.|$|E
25|$|Abraham and Sarah {{go to the}} Philistine town of Gerar, {{pretending to}} be brother and sister (they are half-siblings). The King of Gerar takes Sarah for his wife, but God warns him to return her, and he obeys. God sends Sarah a son to be named Isaac, through whom the {{covenant}} will be established. At Sarah's insistence, Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness, but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread {{and water and}} sent them away. The two wandered in the {{wilderness}} of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation.</b> A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.|$|E

25|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} on January 30, 1933, he began the {{suppression}} of the Communist Party of Germany. The Nazis took police measures against Soviet trade missions, companies, press representatives, and individual citizens in Germany. They also launched an anti-Soviet propaganda campaign coupled with a lack of good will in diplomatic relations, although the German Foreign Ministry under Konstantin von Neurath (foreign minister from 1932–1938) was vigorously opposed to the impending breakup. The second volume of Hitler's programmatic Mein Kampf (which first appeared in 1926) called for Lebensraum (living space for the German nation) in the east (mentioning Russia specifically), and, in keeping with his world view, portrayed the Communists as Jews (see also Jewish Bolshevism) who were destroying <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation.</b> This ambition, if implemented, would be a clear danger to the security of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God {{is portrayed}} as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's {{principal}} relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created. Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and {{is concerned with the}} actions of mankind. According to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), God promised Abraham to make of his offspring <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation.</b> Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people. These commandments are but two of a large corpus of commandments and laws that constitute this covenant, which is the substance of Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Terah, {{the ninth}} in descent from Noah, {{was the father}} of three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran {{was the father of}} Lot (who was thus Abram's nephew), and died in his native city, Ur of the Chaldees. Abram married Sarah (Sarai), who was barren. Terah, with Abram, Sarai, and Lot, then {{departed}} for Canaan, but settled in a place named Haran, where Terah {{died at the age of}} 205. God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation,</b> bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to Shechem in Canaan.|$|E
50|$|The bombing {{campaign}} targeted mostly government buildings, {{along with several}} banks. The group stated {{that the government had}} been exploiting other nations by waging war as a means of solidifying America as <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>nation.</b> Most were preceded by evacuation warnings, along with communiqués identifying the particular matter that the attack was intended to protest. No people were killed in any of their acts of property destruction, although three members of the group were killed in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion.|$|R

The film then shows Phil Esposito in the penalty box from video of the series. Esposito is [...] "performing a menacing pantomime" [...] {{in the words of}} author Dave Bidini. The term [...] "Esposito" [...] also was added as a derogatory term to street slang in Russia.|$|E
500|$|The public disliked Scot's {{original}} reverse design, deeming the depicted eagle scrawny and {{unworthy of}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation</b> {{such as the}} United States aspired to be. The new Mint director, Elias Boudinot, asked Scot to redesign the reverse. The so-called Heraldic Eagle design was struck on quarter eagles as early as 1796, but did not appear on the eagle until the following year, with the other gold denomination, the half eagle, following in 1798. The initial design (dubbed by some the [...] "Plain Eagle") had been struck in relatively small numbers, 13,344 over the design's three-year life.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] period {{following}} {{the unification of}} Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation</b> by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under Wilhelm II, Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed. This resulted in creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary, promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support. Subsequently, the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia. Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.|$|E
5000|$|Resolution 804 {{concluded}} by deploying UNAVEM II {{primarily in}} the capital Luanda, partly due to demands by African <b>nations</b> for <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> United <b>Nations</b> presence, requesting the Secretary-General to review developments and report back to the Council before 30 April 1993.|$|R
50|$|The revolutionary {{government}} gave repeated {{evidence of}} {{its desire to}} establish Libya {{as a leader of}} the Islamic world. Moreover, Gaddafi's efforts to create an Arab nation through political union with other Arab states were also based on a desire to create <b>a</b> <b>great</b> Islamic <b>nation.</b> Indeed, Gaddafi drew little distinction between the two.|$|R
50|$|I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly {{ruined my}} country. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> {{industrial}} <b>nation</b> is now controlled by its system of credit.

2500|$|A {{month after}} Britain's first atomic weapons test, America tested the first {{thermonuclear}} (hydrogen) bomb. The Soviets tested their first in 1953. Penney believed that Britain {{could not afford}} to develop a hydrogen bomb. Henry Tizard believed that the nation should focus on conventional forces instead of duplicating the nuclear capabilities of the American Strategic Air Command, which already defended Britain and Europe: [...] "We are <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation,</b> but if we continue to behave like a Great Power we shall soon cease to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation.</b> Let us take warning from the fate of the Great Powers of the past and not burst ourselves with pride." ...|$|E

50|$|While on a {{visit in}} Berlin in 1936 to address the Nazi Law Society, Toynbee was invited to have a private {{interview}} with Adolf Hitler, at Hitler's request. Hitler emphasized his limited expansionist aim of building <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> German <b>nation,</b> and his desire for British understanding and cooperation. Toynbee believed that Hitler was sincere and endorsed Hitler's message in a confidential memorandum for the British prime minister and foreign secretary.|$|R
2500|$|In his February 7, 2008 {{appearance}} at the Conservative Political Action Committee, during which he withdrew from the Presidential race, Romney mentioned France in less flattering terms.

2500|$|In {{the long}} fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob {{said that he}} would go to see Joseph before he died. Jacob journeyed to Beersheba with all that he had and offered sacrifices to God. God spoke to Jacob in a dream, saying that Jacob should not fear to go to Egypt, for God would go with him, make <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation</b> of him, and also surely bring him back. Jacob's sons carried him, their little ones, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent. They took their cattle and their goods and came to Egypt, Jacob, and his entire family.

As the strike dragged on into its third week, coal supplies were running low and public sentiment was calling for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came on December 10. Palmer's tough stand won him considerable praise from business and professional groups. He received one letter that said: [...] "A lion-hearted man, with <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>nation</b> behind him, has brought {{order out of}} chaos.
