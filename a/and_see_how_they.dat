5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E

Two additional characters, Jill Valentine and Shuma-Gorath, {{are also available}} as downloadable content. According to producer Niitsuma, character selection was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel Comics. Marvel gave Niitsuma and his team precise directions regarding the Marvel characters' designs, but was willing to leave game balancing to Capcom. In regards to characters who did not originate from fighting games, such as Deadpool and Arthur, Niitsuma's team tried to [...] "preserve their essence" [...] from their source material <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could siphon it into an interesting fighting game character.|$|E
2500|$|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania {{became the}} site of the worst {{violence}} of related strikes. Thomas Alexander Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad, described {{as one of the first}} robber barons, suggested that the strikers should be given [...] "a rifle diet for a few days <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> like that kind of bread." [...] As in some other cities and towns, local law enforcement officers such as sheriffs, deputies and police refused to fire on the strikers. [...] Several state militia units were ordered into service by Governor John Hartranft, including the 3rd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel George R. Snowden.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} this, the King {{household}} was visited by Mike Wallace, {{who wanted to}} visit her {{and the rest of}} her family <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were fairing that coming Christmas. She introduced her family to Wallace and also expressed her belief that there would not be another Martin Luther King, Jr. because he comes around [...] "once in a century" [...] or [...] "maybe once in a thousand years". She furthered that she believed her children needed her more than ever, and that there was hope for redemption in her husband's death. In January 1969, King and Bernita Bennette left for a trip to India. Before arriving in the country, the two stopped in Verona, Italy and King was awarded the Universal Love Award. King became the first non-Italian to receive the award. King traveled to London with her sister, sister-in-law, Bernita and several others to preach at St. Paul's Cathedral. Before, no woman had ever delivered a sermon at a regularly appointed service in the cathedral.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} 2006 {{season was}} a series of surveys of the region around Kabri. The goals of this season were only partially fulfilled during the original timeframe though, as the 2006 season coincided with the 2006 Lebanon War. The team was able to survey MB II sites in the area around the site <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would have interacted with Kabri in that time period. However, {{as a result of the}} war, they had to postpone any aerial photography of the tel – by order of the Israeli Air Force – and access to the pottery from previous excavations – held in the IAA storerooms at Kibbutz Beit HaEmek – was restricted for the duration of the war. In that time period, the IAA did allow the team to remove the relevant pottery from Beit HaEmek [...] to Tel Aviv for study, where the pottery could also be kept safe. The team had to wait until mid-September to achieve its goals fully. As a result of the dangers posed by the rockets from the north, [...] some members of the team had to return to their home countries, without completing their work.|$|E
2500|$|What {{passes in}} the world for [...] "good-nature", Hazlitt argues, [...] "is often no better than {{indolent}} selfishness". The Lord Chancellor, {{as an example of a}} good-natured man, [...] "would not hurt a fly ... has a fine oiliness in his disposition .... does not enter into the quarrels or enmities of others; bears their calamities with patience ... listens to the din and clang of war, the earthquake and the hurricane of the political and moral world with the temper and the spirit of a philosopher ...". But this sort of good-natured person, exemplified by Eldon, is, if one scrutinises the case, good-natured out of selfishness: [...] "tread on the toe of one of these amiable and imperturbable mortals, or let a lump of soot fall down the chimney and spoil their dinners, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> will bear it." [...] "All their patience is confined to the accidents that befal others: all their good humour is to be resolved into giving themselves no concern about any thing but their own ease and self-indulgence. Their charity begins and ends at home." [...] Their mode of self-focus cuts them off from human connexion: their [...] "being free from the common infirmities of temper is owing to their indifference to the common feelings of humanity".|$|E

2500|$|With work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino {{returned}} {{to the notion of}} a trilogy film: [...] "I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story." [...] Tarantino explains that the idea [...] "was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories— the oldest stories in the book... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'— the oldest story about... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times." [...] "I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry", he says. [...] "Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> unravel." [...] In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: [...] "I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [...] I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk".|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky {{returned}} as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil, and was assisted {{on the first}} episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' costume of leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots. Maslansky's fashion choices for each character were influenced by their comic incarnations, with her saying, [...] "You really have to study your history of the original characters <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> dress, how they were originally drawn, how they evolved through the years in these comics. And what you might discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time." [...] Maslansky also stated that [...] "everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it’s not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we’ve created in Hell’s Kitchen." [...] On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from {{having to deal with}} the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.|$|E
