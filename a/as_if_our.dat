500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|According to Murray Bookchin, {{the idea}} that humans must {{dominate}} nature is common in hierarchical societies. Bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships, if unchecked, {{have the capacity to}} reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a commodity: [...] "The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital." [...] Social ecology, founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the days}} {{following}} the conclave, the cardinals were generally elated at the reaction to Pope John Paul I, some of them happily saying that they had elected [...] "God's candidate". Argentine Cardinal Eduardo Francisco Pironio stated, [...] "We were witnesses of a moral miracle." [...] Mother Teresa, commenting about the new pope, [...] "He has been the greatest gift of God, a sun beam of God's love shining {{in the darkness of}} the world." [...] British primate Basil Cardinal Hume declared: [...] "Once it had happened, it seemed totally and entirely right ... We felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> hands were being guided as we wrote his name on the paper".|$|E
60|$|Henry and Barringford {{were also}} attacked, {{so they could}} do nothing for their companion. The Iroquois were ten strong, and soon it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>our</b> friends would {{undoubtedly}} be killed and scalped.|$|R
60|$|I say, moreover, {{that though}} a seventh day sabbath is not natural to man as man, yet our christian holy day is natural to us <b>as</b> saints, <b>if</b> <b>our</b> consciences are not clogged before with some old fables, or Jewish customs.|$|R
60|$|And as Jerry {{grasped the}} gunwale, Peters raised his heavy foot <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to crush <b>our</b> hero's fingers.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} after two of the deserters had been {{tortured}} to death, it began to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> people would have little time for idleness.|$|E
60|$|We bowled away at {{six o'clock}} to Mr. Wardlaw Ramsay's. Found we were a week too early, and went back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> noses had been bleeding.|$|E
60|$|It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> {{own safety}} demanded {{that we give}} some especial {{attention}} to the traitor, and I proposed that we consult with Darius at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Steady, men!" [...] Captain Reuben shouted. [...] "Touch not sheet or tack. We must sail past <b>as</b> <b>if</b> bent on <b>our</b> own business. <b>If</b> {{we change}} <b>our</b> course, now, they will suspect that {{something}} is wrong.|$|R
5000|$|The focused prayer, when [...] "the mind {{is focused}} upon the words" [...] of the prayer, [...] "speaking them <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were <b>our</b> own." ...|$|R

6000|$|Instantly every bow was bent, and {{it seemed}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> bold hunter {{were about to be}} pierced by a hundred arrows, when he turned round and cried:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Foster dryly, [...] "it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> plot {{had succeeded}} {{better than we}} thought. We {{certainly}} didn't expect the fellow would follow me to England." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was a great}} plan!" [...] I replied, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>our</b> {{troubles}} were at an end, {{and then}} again came the {{thought that it would}} be necessary for us to creep out from the thicket under the very noses of those who were on guard, and straightway all my fears returned.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there she}} is now, coming along <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> {{grenadiers}} were after her!" [...] exclaimed the Captain, {{as the sound of}} steps and a wailing voice came nearer and nearer.|$|E
60|$|Nestor was on {{his feet}} almost as soon as I. The three of us huddled about that little box <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> lives {{depended}} upon the message it had for us.|$|E
60|$|I {{have set}} all this down at {{considerable}} length because, {{in view of}} what finally occurred, it was much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> people had a premonition of that which was to come.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} today between Left and Right {{today is}} nowhere nearly as profound <b>as</b> slavery was.. <b>If</b> <b>our</b> forebears could fix that, {{we should be}} able to fix our current problems with crony capitalism.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] consented {{the young}} clergyman. [...] "It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> own race became alienated from {{us through the}} mere effect of time, don't you think, sir? I mean, of course, terrestrially." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{braced himself}} {{at the thought of}} Bianca. We turned, and in silence we paced back, quite leisurely <b>as</b> <b>if</b> entirely at <b>our</b> ease, for all that Cavalcanti's face had grown very haggard.|$|R
60|$|Mor. You talk <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were <b>our</b> bridal night: Fondness {{is still}} the effect of new delight, And {{marriage}} but the pleasure of a day: The metal's base, the gilding worn away.|$|R
60|$|And {{it was not}} uttered once or twice, {{but again}} and again, until the whole woods trembled with it, and we felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> ears could not endure more of it without the tympanums being burst.|$|E

60|$|Again did {{it appear}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>our</b> {{officers}} were not fully decided upon {{what should be}} done, for Colonel Gridley and Colonel Prescott, together {{with a number of}} captains, consulted a long time, while we remained in line near the wagons.|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled at}} her quietly, and said, [...] "I suppose it is because he treats us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>our</b> brother. But he loves {{not to have the}} {{difference}} of birth dwelt upon." ...|$|R
