40|$|A key {{step in the}} {{stereotype}} production method, and in other methods of warning symbol development, is the evaluation of symbol sketches produced by naïve design participants. These sketches provide valuable insight into the expectations of potential warning symbol users about the content and design of the symbol. Until recently, the symbol development process depended heavily on designers ’ expertise to judge the intent of a participant’s sketch and its similarities to other participants ’ drawings. However, mathematical and computational techniques have been introduced that assist symbol designers by clustering similar sketches by their graphical attributes and evolving new designs from prior sketches based on the most preferred symbolic components. Semantic annotation is used to attach standardized descriptive terms to the sketches which the clustering process uses to discriminate between the otherwise very subjective symbol drawings. Unfortunately, semantic annotation can be a lengthy process of annotators studying the nuances of each sketch. This is incongruent with the real-world usage of warning symbols where an individual’s attention is fixated on a symbol {{for only a few}} seconds during which time the message must be received. The process of Rapid Semantic Annotation is proposed to better match the field experience of symbol users to the design process and to reduce the designers ’ time spent on semantic <b>annotation.</b> <b>Symbol</b> sketches for two warning referents (“hot exhaust ” and “do not touch with wet hands”) were taken from a previous stud...|$|E

This article maps the usage of technical signs in a corpus of early medieval Irish manuscripts produced on the Continent or preserved and used there early after the production. In the center of the inquiry are four manuscripts belonging to an Irish scholarly circle associated with Sedulius Scottus. The article concludes that: * Insular, and specifically Irish, annotators used a specific repertoire of technical signs; * This Insular/Irish repertoire is substantially distinct from the repertoire of technical signs used by Carolingian scribes and therefore allows for discerning books annotated by Insular/Irish users on the Continent; * A noticeable difference exists between various identifiable clusters of manuscripts annotated by Insular/Irish users, suggesting that different annotators and circles drew on different parts of the Insular repertoire; * The manuscripts from the Sedulius group stand out from among other Irish books produced on the Continent on account of the specific mode of annotation, which seems to have been particular to the circle of scholars that produced them; * The Greek Psalter of Sedulius, which contains the subscription of Sedulius Scottus, displays a pattern of sign use distinct from the one found in the manuscripts from the Sedulius group and therefore does not seem related to them; * One or two lightly-annotated manuscripts contain traces of annotation in the manner of the Sedulius circle and therefore may reflect activities of the scholars from this scholarly group...|$|R

However, existing tools that allow the exploration of such gene-to-gene relationships, apply each sim-ilarity independently. To make use of multidimen-sional scoring, we developed a new search engine named Genehopper. It can handle two query types: (i) the typical use case starts with a term-to-gene search, i. e. an optimized full-text search for an an-chor gene of interest. The web-interface can handle one or more terms including gene symbols and iden-tifiers of Ensembl, UniProt, EntrezGene and RefSeq.

Each weight can be adjusted by the user, allowing flexible customization of the gene search. All implemented similarities have a low pairwise correlation (max r 2 = 0. 4) implying a low linear dependency, i. e. any change in a single weight {{has an effect on}} the rank-ing.

40|$|Abstract—Optical Character Recognition (OCR) {{problems}} are often formulated as isolated character (symbol) classification task {{followed by a}} post-classification stage (which contains modules like Unicode generation, error correction etc.) to generate the textual representation, {{for most of the}} Indian scripts. Such approaches are prone to failures due to (i) difficulties in designing reliable word-to-symbol segmentation module that can robustly work in presence of degraded (cut/fused) images and (ii) convert-ing the outputs of the classifiers to a valid sequence of Unicodes. In this paper, we propose a formulation, where the expectations on these two modules is minimized, and the harder recognition task is modelled as learning of an appropriate sequence to sequence translation scheme. We thus formulate the recognition as a direct transcription problem. Given many examples of feature sequences and their corresponding Unicode representations, our objective is to learn a mapping which can convert a word directly into a Unicode sequence. This formulation has multiple practical advantages: (i) This reduces the number of classes significantly for the Indian scripts. (ii) It removes the need for a reliable word-to-symbol segmentation. (ii) It does not require strong <b>annotation</b> of <b>symbols</b> to design the classifiers, and (iii) It directly generates a valid sequence of Unicodes.
