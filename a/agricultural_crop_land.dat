In general, maturation takes between 2 and 4  weeks depending on the yearly course of the weather (J. Hufnagel and N. Svoboda, ZALF, Müncheberg, Germany, personal communication). In our calculations, we assumed that maturation starts 3  weeks before harvesting in all years and different scenario runs. Harvest dates differ between the relevant crops (Table  1). Thus, the soil water content and irrigation requirement for e.g. sugar beet were computed from day 107 with a start value of 224.9  l/m 3 until day 269 (i.e. start of maturation). The crop plants listed in Table  1 grow on 90 % of the currently cultivated agricultural area in the county of Uelzen.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} in the United States uses vast areas of land. This {{is one of the}} primary characteristics that distinguishes agriculture from other industries. In 1999, approximately 330 million acres of land were planted in principal agricultural crops (NASS, 2000). Land is the important basic resource that supports the production of all agricultural commodities, including livestock, which is dependent on land to produce the grain and forage consumed. The total value of farm real estate was estimated to be $ 745. 2 billion in 2000, representing approximately three-fourths of total farm assets (ERS, 1999). Clearly, one of the more important tasks of a farm manager is that of maintaining and improving the productivity of the land resource.

30|$|In 2012 Switzerland {{agreed on}} a Strategy for Civil Protection 2015 +, which {{continues}} to include risk analysis in the portfolio of future tasks to be undertaken {{within the field of}} civil protection (SFC 2012 a). In 2008, a national risk analysis was mandated to the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection (SFOCP) by the Swiss Federal Council. Hazards and potential damages based on damage indicators are analyzed periodically. Based on this analysis, an account of risks as an expression of the combination of the likelihood and extent of potential damage within the context of DRM is provided. Switzerland has an almost 20 -year history of developing and applying a methodology for risk analysis (see Guideline KATANOS—Catastrophes and Emergencies in Switzerland. A Comparative Overview (SFOCP 1995); Guideline KATARISK—Catastrophes and Emergencies in Switzerland. A Risk Analysis from the Perspective of Civil Protection (SFOCP 2003)). Although the federal legislation—Federal Law on civil protection (BZG)—does not include the requirement to conduct risk analyses on the Swiss canton level, 20 of the 26 cantons have conducted risk analyses within the last 10  years. Of those, 15 have enacted a political mandate in addition to or instead of a corresponding law, strengthening the implementation of risk analysis politically (Bara 2011). The guideline KATAPLAN (Cantonal Risk Analysis and Prevention), developed by SFOCP (2013), has assisted the cantons in conducting their analysis since 2008. KATAPLAN starts by identifying threats, developing various scenarios according to different projected frequencies and magnitudes of these threats, and estimates their potential adverse consequences, hence risks. The results of the semi-quantitative risk analysis are mapped as a coordinate within a risk matrix. The result of the damage analysis is a specific damage category adaptable to the cantonal context (for example, 30 – 100 casualties, 10 – 30  km 2 of damaged <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop</b> <b>land).</b> In order to define such clearly bounded damage classes, some degree of vulnerability analysis needs to be conducted. However, the vulnerability analysis is implicit rather than explicit and remains vague with respect to the methods used and the level of detail acquired. KATAPLAN does not address or implement the concept of resilience. In comparison, the National Strategy for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure (SFC 2012 b) identifies resilience as the overall aim and vulnerability analysis as a tool for reaching this aim.|$|E

Consistent detection of a subset of 7 herbicides suggested that atmospheric deposition, either directly or in rain, was the principal pathway from fields to the reservoirs. However, the highest concentrations and number of herbicides in drinking water were associated with runoff from a localized 133 -mm rainfall over 15 days toward the end of spring herbicide application.

30|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} vary {{in their}} assessment of post-mining land use achievement, especially when the post-mining land use requires development. If the development is achieved within the SMCRA regulatory period, the construction process would often satisfy regulatory requirements concerning post-mining land use. If a post-mining land use like building site development is not actually achieved, regulatory interpretations would vary. In Virginia, for example, a mine site with an industrial post-mining land use that does not result in actual industrial development may be approved for bond release, if site configuration, access, underlying spoil stability, and other characteristics have been created that make it suitable for eventual industrial development (Zipper and Yates 2009). Among land uses, those intended to support livestock grazing (e.g. pasture land) are often assessed {{on whether or not}} grazing animals are supported by the forage plants established during reclamation. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>cropping</b> <b>land</b> uses, such as hay <b>land</b> and <b>crop</b> <b>land</b> and including “prime farmland,” are often assessed for compliance based on a comparison of measured post-mining yields to those recorded prior to mining on those same lands, or on nearby reference areas with similar soils and site conditions.

For both the pre-industrial period and in recent times, after taking into account the large-scale changes in synthetic N fertiliser production, we find an overall conversion factor of 3 - 5 % from newly fixed N to N 2 O-N. We assume the same factor to be valid for biofuel production systems. It is covered only in part by the default conversion factor for "direct" emissions from <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop</b> <b>lands</b> (1 %) estimated by IPCC (2006), and the default factors for the "indirect" emissions (following volatilization/deposition and leaching/runoff of N: 0. 35 - 0. 45 %) cited therein. However, as we show in the paper, when additional emissions included in the IPCC methodology, e. g. those from livestock production, are included, the total may not be inconsistent with that given by our "top-down"method When the extra N 2 O emission from biofuel production is calculated in "CO 2 equivalent"global warming terms, and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of "saving" emissions of fossil fuel derived CO 2, the outcome is that the production of commonly used biofuels, such as biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), depending on N fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plants, can contribute as much or more to global warming by N 2 O emissions than cooling by fossil fuel savings. Crops with less N demand, such as grasses and woody coppice species, have more favourable climate impacts. This analysis only considers the conversion of biomass to biofuel. It {{does not take into account}} the use of fossil fuel on the farms and for fertilizer and pesticide production, but it also neglects the production of useful co-products.

However, {{the intensity of the}} biofuels political economy in poor countries worsens inequality for the vulnerable poor. This is evidenced by large-scale land acquisitions in Africa for biofuel and crop production primarily for foreign consumption – food, animal feeds and energy crops. The search for land in African countrieshas been triggered by growing concerns over food and energy security in developed countries following the global food crisis of 2008. Moreover, these recent developments in large-scale land acquisitions in Africa are not a new phenomenon, but represent the renewal of old practices incommercial agriculture, which is either conducted through purchases or long-term leases. In addition to biofuel expansion, this study notes that current large-scale land acquisitions in sub-Saharan Africa have been further driven by demands to access water resources for other commercial <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> The <b>land</b> purchases or leases automatically guarantee access to African water. This demand for water is a response to climate change: most industrialists believe that acquiring land near a main water reservoir will guarantee future agricultural potential.

First, a cellular automaton (CA) model representing LUCC was developed using a time series of remotely sensed Landsat TM images for a 90 000 -ha intensive study area within the region and calibrated using alternative images from the time series. The classified images were linked to spatially referenced biophysical and socioeconomic coverages used as input data, and then combined with ‘rules’ derived from empirical analyses. Second, the CA model was used in dynamic simulations to explore LUCC as both causes and consequences of (a) road development, (b) agricultural extensification and land abandonment, (c) major shifts in world markets and crop prices, and (d) urban expansion of the central city within the region.

The disaggregated product, while implicitly taking into account effects of land cover and surface roughness at different scales, provide a statistical approach to downscale regional soil moisture measurements to a finer spatial scale...|$|R
