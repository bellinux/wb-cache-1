In this paper, {{we focus on the}} relation between <b>a</b> primary <b>system</b> that directly interacts and learns the input-output relation within an environment, and <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> that continuously monitors and is able to direct the primary system. We hold that consciousness is not composed of <b>a</b> primary <b>system</b> alone, but that the employment of <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> is essential. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to clarify the importance of <b>a</b> secondary <b>system.</b> We show by numerical experiments that the addition of <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> provides adaptability to a wider range of environmental changes than <b>a</b> primary <b>system</b> alone. Alternatively, we present an extraordinary case where <b>a</b> customized primary <b>system</b> fully adapts to an environment undergoing a particular type of change. Far from refuting the value of <b>a</b> secondary <b>system,</b> this special case serves to point out the importance of the effective design of <b>a</b> secondary <b>system.</b> Therefore, we confirm the value and usefulness of <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> in <b>a</b> machine consciousness <b>system</b> through these numericalexperiments...|$|R
