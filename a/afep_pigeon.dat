50|$|The <b>Afep</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba unicincta), {{also known}} as the African wood-pigeon or gray wood-pigeon,is {{a member of the family}} Columbidae which lives in Africa. In West Africa it can be found in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, CÃ´te D'Ivoire and Ghana. In Central Africa its range extends from {{south-eastern}} Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic to Uganda. There are isolated pockets further south in Angola.|$|E
50|$|The genus Columba is {{the largest}} within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. Its members are {{typically}} pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves. One of several subgroups within Columba consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon, Bolle's pigeon, the Trocaz pigeon, and the African <b>Afep</b> <b>pigeon.</b> Two Macaronesian endemic pigeons, Bolle's and Trocaz, {{are thought to be}} derived from isolated island populations of C. palumbus.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the plant}} species occur only {{in this part of}} Ghana, or in few other localities and part was {{declared}} as a specially protected GSBA (Globally significant Biodiversity area) following a national botanic survey of forest reserves by Ghana Forestry Dept. in the 1990s. The forest reserve contains many birds that are rare elsewhere in Ghana including <b>afep</b> <b>pigeon,</b> olive long-tailed cuckoo, African broadbill, least honeyguide, spotted honeyguide, common bristlebill and blue-headed crested-flycatcher. In a 2006 expedition to survey the reserve, scientists discovered two rare and possibly endangered species of primate in the reserve: Geoffroy's pied colobus (Colobus vellerosus) and the olive colobus (Procolobus verus), as well as 17 rare butterfly species and the critically endangered frog species Conraua derooi. Butterfly species include the Papilio antimachus, which has the widest wingspan {{in the world and the}} Mylothris atewa, which may be globally critically endangered.|$|E
