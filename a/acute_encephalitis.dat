40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{management of}} <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis</b> is a challenge. Clinical picture includes general symptoms {{and a wide}} range of neurological signs. Etiological diagnosis cannot be performed only by clinical means and depends on neuroimaging studies and cerebrospinal fluid molecular analyses. It is recommended since some of these viruses are treatable and that the prognoses of these infections depend on the prompt administration of antiviral and/or immunomodulatory drugs. The management of <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis</b> in Brazil has some peculiarities. First, the etiological distribution of the viral encephalitis may differ from what is found in other countries. Some viruses, such as dengue virus, are more common in Brazil than in developed countries while others, like West Nile virus, are not found here. Second, there are some regions in Brazil where neuroimaging and laboratorial methods are not available, and a clinical-based decision is the only therapeutic approach. As most of the guidelines in the literature are based on complimentary methods, it is relevant to establish an alternative approach compatible with the Brazilian health system reality. The goal {{of this study was to}} review the recent advances in the field of the <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis,</b> to discuss the diagnosis and the treatment of the main etiologies of <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis</b> found in Brazil, and to propose a viable guideline for the evaluation of the suspected <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis</b> cases in the emergence room in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Objective:  <b>Acute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a cause}} of significant morbidity and mortality in Nepal.

The outcome of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> {{syndrome is}} variable. Our study was designed to study the clinical profile and outcome of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> syndrome managed in tertiary care center in central Nepal. Methods:  The record of patients admitted with diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> syndrome,from January 2010 to December 2010 in College of Medical Sciences-Teaching Hospital (CMS-TH) was reviewed. They were classified clinically as meningitis, encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. The clinical details and reports of the patients were recorded and analyzed. Results:  Total of 85 cases of meningitis and encephalitis were identified. Mean age was 19. 18 years. Fifty-six (65. 9 %) patients were males and 29 (34. 1 %) were females. Sixty (70. 58 %) patients had meningitis, 8 (9. 41 %) had encephalitis, and 17 (20. 0 %) had meningoencephalitis. JE serology was positive in 4 patients (4. 7 %). Seventy-two (84. 7 %) patients made full recovery and were discharged from hospital. Thirteen (15. 3 %) patients left against medical advice (LAMA). Conclusion:  <b>Acute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> syndrome is still a major public health problem in Nepal. Few of these patients have Japanese Encephalitis.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis</b> is an {{infectious}} disease, which {{is characterized by}} sudden onset, serious clinical picture and with an uncertain outcome. Disturbances of consciousness are common {{in the course of}} <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis.</b> Consciousness is the highest form of psychic life and consciousness disturbances may include quantitative (somnolentia, sopor, coma) and qualitative symptoms (convulsions, twilight state). Material and methods. We investigated 63 patients with <b>acute</b> viral <b>encephalitis.</b> The youngest patient was 15, and the oldest one 69 years of age. We examined the state of consciousness in all patients. Results Of all examined patients, 54 (85. 72 %) patients had disturbances of consciousness, 9 (14. 25 %) patients had no consciousness disturbances, 11 (17. 46 %) patients had sopor and 24 (38. 09 %) patients were in coma. The highest percentage of lethal outcomes was recorded in coma patients (12. 5 %). The longer the duration of consciousness disturbances, the higher the mortality among these patients. Discussion Subjective and objective factors cause different grades and duration of consciousness disturbances. The highest percentage of patients who recovered without consequences was established in the group of patients (81. 82 %) with somnolence. The highest percentage of patients who recovered with consequences (20. 8 %) and patients (12. 5 %) with lethal outcome was recorded in the group of patients in coma.
