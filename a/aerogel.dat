40|$|Polysaccharide-based <b>aerogels</b> are a novel concept with {{potential}} application {{in the food}} sector due to their material properties, renewability and sustainability. High absorption capacity of polysaccharide <b>aerogels</b> makes them a potential moisture absorbent material in meat packaging. The aim of this work was to study the tamarind seed galactoxyloglucan (XG) <b>aerogels</b> as potential meat packaging material by testing their absorption capacity and mechanical properties. Another objective {{of this study was}} to create an oxygen scavenger system by incorporating enzyme galactose oxidase, which utilizes oxygen in its enzymatic cycle, into <b>aerogels</b> matrix and thus removes residual oxygen from modified atmosphere meat packaging. Absorption capacity of <b>aerogels</b> was investigated in three different liquids (water, saline and drip) by immersion of <b>aerogels</b> samples for 48 h. Five specimens of each group were used for texture analysis. In addition, incorporation of monosaccharide substrate and enzymes was performed and oxidation reaction was followed at different time intervals. Degree of oxidation was determined by gas chromatography˗mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. XG <b>aerogels</b> showed high absorption capacity absorbing water and saline 40 times their weight. However, absorption of drip was 20 times their initial weight. Texture analysis results demonstrated that wet <b>aerogels</b> are strong enough to hold the meat while at the same time elastic enough not to fracture under load applied. Incorporation of enzymes into <b>aerogels</b> in aqueous system showed promising results with degree of oxidation 56 and 73 % after 48 h.

The as synthesized zirconia <b>aerogels</b> can be applied as a catalyst in replacement to supercritically dried zirconia <b>aerogels.</b> Therefore, {{it is challenging to}} synthesize high surface area mesoporous zirconia <b>aerogels</b> via ambient pressure drying.

Brij- 76 is a non-ionic surfactant consisting of hydrophobic tail (long alcohol chain) and hydrophilic head (polyoxyethylene) [29].
