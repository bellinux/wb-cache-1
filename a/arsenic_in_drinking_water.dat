500|$|Arsenic is {{notoriously}} poisonous {{and may also}} be an essential element in ultratrace amounts. During World War I, both sides used [...] "arsenic-based sneezing and vomiting agents…to force enemy soldiers to remove their gas masks before firing mustard or phosgene at them in a second salvo."

Arsenic is also a component of melarsoprol, a medicinal drug used in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic arsenic {{exposure}} {{has been}} shown to cause liver damage. However, serum hepatic enzyme activity as recognized on liver function tests (LFTs) showing a dose-response relationship with arsenic exposure has not yet been clearly documented. The aim of our study was to investigate the dose-response relationship between arsenic exposure and major serum enzyme marker activity associated with LFTs in the population living in arsenic-endemic areas in Bangladesh. Methods A total of 200 residents living in arsenic-endemic areas in Bangladesh were selected as study subjects. <b>Arsenic</b> concentrations <b>in</b> the <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> hair and nails were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The study subjects were stratified into quartile groups as follows, based on concentrations of <b>arsenic</b> <b>in</b> the <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> as well as in subjects' hair and nails: lowest, low, medium and high. The serum hepatic enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were then assayed. Results <b>Arsenic</b> concentrations <b>in</b> the subjects' hair and nails were positively correlated with <b>arsenic</b> levels <b>in</b> the <b>drinking</b> <b>water.</b> As regards the exposure-response relationship with <b>arsenic</b> <b>in</b> the <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> the respective activities of ALP, AST and ALT were found to be significantly increased in the high-exposure groups compared to the lowest-exposure groups before and after adjustments were made for different covariates. With internal exposure markers (<b>arsenic</b> <b>in</b> hair and nails), the ALP, AST and ALT activity profiles assumed a similar shape of dose-response relationship, with very few differences seen in the higher groups compared to the lowest group, most likely due to the temporalities of exposure metrics. Conclusions The present study demonstrated that <b>arsenic</b> concentrations <b>in</b> the <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> were strongly correlated with <b>arsenic</b> concentrations <b>in</b> the subjects' hair and nails. Further, this study revealed a novel exposure- and dose- response relationship between arsenic exposure metrics and serum hepatic enzyme activity. Elevated serum hepatic enzyme activities in the higher exposure gradients provided new insights into arsenic-induced liver toxicity that might be helpful for the early prognosis of arsenic-induced liver diseases. </p...|$|R

Her subsequent work has provided phylogenetic evidence that the AS3MT gene moved by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to animals during their early evolution, and independently on several occasions to other eukaryotic phylae as well.

The work was focused to minimize interference encountered with a standard screen-printed electrodes featuring an onboard gold working electrode, carbon counter and silver−silver chloride pseudo-reference electrodes as composite coatings on plastic surface. The interference effect was identified as chloride ions interacting with the silver surface of the reference electrode and formation of soluble silver chloride complexes such as AgCl 43 −. By modification of the reference electrodes with Nafion membrane (5 [*]% in alcohols), the interference was entirely eliminated. However, membrane coverage and uniformity can impact the electrodes reproducibility and performance. Hence, the sensor design was further considered and a microband format was produced lending favorable diffusive to capacitive current characteristics. Using the microband electrodes allowed As(III) detection with limit of detection of 0. 8  ppb (in 4  M HCl electrolyte), inherently avoiding the problems of electrode fouling and maximizing analyte signal in river water samples. This is below the World Health Organization limit of 10  μg[*]L− 1 (ppb). The electrolyte system was chosen {{so as to avoid}} problems from other common metal ions, most notably Cu(II).
