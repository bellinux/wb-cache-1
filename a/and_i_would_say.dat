25|$|We'd see Basie in town, and I was {{impressed}} by Harry Edison and Buck Clayton, being a trumpet player. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> I {{was impressed}} by Dizzy Gillespie {{when he was with}} Cab Calloway. I {{was impressed by}} those three trumpet players of the people I saw in person... I thought Harry Edison and Dizzy Gillespie were the most unique of the trumpet players I heard.|$|E
500|$|I {{have faith}} in my fans. I believe they will come through for me, because they always have. My house is not {{complete}} without an American Moonman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> 'Touch My Body' deserves one. Brett Ratner directed it, I have a unicorn in there, I have [...] in there — who else has that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Price {{felt that}} all the actors on the set had a {{difficult}} time with the director, explaining: [...] "Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors. He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There— you're doing it again. Don't do that'." [...] Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.|$|E

500|$|Israel sharply {{condemned}} {{the release of}} the Munich perpetrators and accused West Germany of having [...] "capitulated to terrorism". Prime Minister Golda Meir stated on the following day: [...] "We have been depressed since yesterday, aggrieved <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> insulted, that the human spirit, so weak and helpless, has surrendered to brutal force." [...] Foreign Minister Abba Eban filed an official protest note with the West German government, and the Israeli ambassador in Bonn was temporarily called back, officially due to consultations.|$|E
500|$|Once Iñárritu {{agreed to}} direct, {{he began working}} with Smith on script rewrites. In an {{interview}} with Creative Screenwriting, Smith admitted during this process he was unsure if Iñárritu would {{even be able to}} film some of the sequences they wrote. He recalled, [...] "He would have some ideas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Alejandro, we can’t pull this off. It’s not going to work,' and he would say, 'Mark, trust me, we can do this.' In the end, he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'You have {{me for the rest of}} your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> rather <b>say</b> {{nothing about}} it," [...] Mrs. Ellison said. [...] "It {{is a matter}} which has been {{productive}} of much pain to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>say</b> nothing about it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Frege responded {{promptly}} that [...] "Your {{discovery of}} the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>say,</b> consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic".|$|R
5000|$|In 1927 {{three of}} her poems were {{included}} in Serle's An Australasian Anthology. The critic H.M. Green wrote [...] "She has written {{some of the best}} lyrics among today's <b>and</b> certainly, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> the best love lyrics written out here." ...|$|R
500|$|She {{joined the}} staff of the {{newspaper}} in 1915, originally as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: [...] "Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long'". When her father went on vacation {{less than a year after}} her appearance in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at The Miami Metropolis whose greater familiarity with the history of Miami gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{signaled}} Clarkson for a low ball on {{one side}} and when it came it was high up on the other. It struck my hand as I tried to get it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it was a passed ball. You can give it to me if you want to. Clarkson told me that it slipped from his hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|I wasn’t so {{interested}} in macro, but what struck me, and this is related to some of my later work, was the assumption that [...] made to solve for equilibrium, that the state variables were obvious.... Bob and I had some long discussions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> “Well Bob, why is this the actual state space in this model?” [...] That question came up ... after I came to Penn. [...] At some point Karl [...] and I started talking about that and we developed what we called the idea of sunspots.|$|E
5000|$|Frege {{promptly}} {{wrote back}} to Russell acknowledging the problem: Your {{discovery of the}} contradiction caused me the greatest surprise <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>say,</b> consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.|$|R

2500|$|Wild {{retained}} {{a sense of}} bitterness about the federal government's short-sightedness that thwarted the project. He said: The thing that lost the project in the end {{was that we were}} asking for some very reasonable taxation arrangements which would apply {{in the early days of}} very heavy spending – in the long run we would be paying more taxes but we just wanted to ease the taxes during that early time – and that was knocked back by the government, in fact by the treasurer ... Paul Keating, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that he is the man responsible for stopping [...] project." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{called the}} bomb attempt a [...] "sobering {{reminder}} of the times in which we live", and said that Americans [...] "will not cower in fear" [...] {{as a result of}} it. He telephoned Duane Jackson, one of the vendors, to thank him for alerting police. Attorney General Eric Holder called it a [...] "terrorist act". White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, similarly, said [...] "Anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, I would say that was intended to terrorize, absolutely. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that whoever did that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|I went to {{the front}} office all the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." [...] Or I would say, [...] "They are {{stepping}} on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." [...] In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.|$|E

"If I might {{presume to}} speak," [...] said Dwining, [...] "as one {{who have made}} my studies both in Spain <b>and</b> Arabia, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> my lord, that the {{sickness}} has appeared in Edinburgh, and {{that there may be}} risk in admitting this young wanderer into your Highness's vicinity." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Always {{we had to}} be on the alert.

2500|$|Ephron's {{marriage}} with Bernstein ended acrimoniously, {{and after the}} breakup Ephron was open about the identity of Deep Throat. She revealed his identity to her son Jacob and anyone else who asked. She once commented, [...] "I would give speeches to 500 people and someone would say, 'Do you know who Deep Throat is?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'It's Mark Felt.'" [...] Classmates of Jacob Bernstein at the Dalton School and Vassar College recall Jacob's revealing to numerous people that Felt was Deep Throat. This revelation attracted little media attention during the many years that the identity of Deep Throat was a mystery. Ephron later conceded that [...] "No one, apart from my sons, believed me." [...] Ephron was invited by Arianna Huffington {{to write about the}} experience in the Huffington Post, for which she was a regular blogger and part-time editor.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Ryan stated, [...] "It's {{going to}} be a CBS procedural. We're going to solve a case every week, but we're going to do it with a lot of humor and a lot of fun. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income {{inequality}} and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is {{going to be}} an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
