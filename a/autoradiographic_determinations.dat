40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the suitability of reference tissue-based quantification methods of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR 5) with [11 C]ABP 688. This study presents in vivo (Positron Emission Tomography (PET)) and in vitro (autoradiography) measurements of mGluR 5 densities in the same rats and evaluates both noninvasive and blood-dependent pharmacokinetic models for the quantification of [11 C]ABP 688 binding. Eleven rats underwent [11 C]ABP 688 PET scans. In five animals, baseline scans were compared with blockade experiments with the antagonist 1, 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) -pyridine (MPEP), and arterial blood samples were drawn and corrected for metabolites. Afterward, saturation-binding autoradiography was performed. Blocking with MPEP resulted in an average decrease of the total distribution volume (VT) between 43 % and 58 % (thalamus and caudate-putamen, respectively) but had no significant effect on cerebellar VT (mean reduction: âˆ’ 0. 01 %). Comparing binding potential (BPND) based on the VT with noninvasively determined BPND revealed an average negative bias of 0. 7 % in the caudate-putamen and an average positive bias of 3. 1 % in the low-binding regions. Scan duration of 50 minutes is required. The cerebellum is a suitable reference region for the quantification of mGluR 5 availability as measured with [11 C]ABP 688 PET in rats. Blood-based and reference region-based PET quantification shows a significant linear relationship to <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>determinations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Spongiosis hepatis {{has been}} known for some time to develop {{frequently}} in livers of rats and fish treated with hepatocarcinogens and was considered to derive from the perisinusoidal (Ito) cells (PSC). Using rat liver treated with N-nitrosomorpholine at different dose levels, we studied the cellular composition and origin as well as the proliferation kinetics of spongiosis hepatis by immunohistochemical demonstration of desmin, vimentin, and alpha-smooth-muscle actin, and by <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>determination</b> of [3 H]-thymidine incorporation, respectively. The vast majority of the cells forming spongiosis hepatis were positive for desmin and vimentin but negative for alpha-smooth-muscle actin, confirming the cellular origin of spongiosis hepatis from PSC. In addition, immunohistochemical demonstration of desmin and vimentin revealed that spongiosis hepatis {{is an integral part of}} larger lesions consisting of focal PSC aggregates. These aggregates show a significantly increased incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine compared with PSC in the extrafocal tissue and in the liver tissue of untreated control animals. In stop experiments, this increased labeling index was maintained many months after withdrawal of the carcinogen, in line with the earlier observation of a progressive behavior of spongiosis hepatis. We conclude that PSC may give rise to proliferative lesions appearing as PSC aggregates associated with more or less pronounced spongiosis hepatis. The persistence, the proliferative activity, and the slow expansive growth of these lesions suggest a benign neoplastic behavior. We therefore propose to classify these lesions as spongiotic pericytoma. Malignant tumors possibly originating from spongiotic pericytoma should consequently by classified as perisinusoidal (Ito) cell sarcomas...|$|R
40|$|The {{anticonvulsants}} phenytoin and carbamazepine interact allosterically {{with the}} batrachotoxin binding site of sodium channels. In the present study, we demonstrate an autoradiographic technique to localize the batrachotoxin binding site on sodium channels in rat brain using [3 H]batrachotoxinin-A 20 -alpha-benzoate (BTX-B). Binding of [3 H]BTX-B to brain sections {{is dependent on}} potentiating allosteric interactions with scorpion venom and is displaced by BTX-B (Kd approximately 200 nM), aconitine, veratridine, and phenytoin with the same rank order of potencies as described in brain synaptosomes. The maximum number of [3 H]BTX-B binding sites in forebrain sections (approximately 1 pmol/mg of protein) also agrees with biochemical <b>determinations.</b> <b>Autoradiographic</b> localizations indicate that [3 H]BTX-B binding sites are not restricted to cell bodies and axons but are present in synaptic zones throughout the brain. For example, a particularly dense concentration of these sites in the substantia nigra is associated with afferent terminals of the striatonigral projection. By contrast, myelinated structures possess much lower densities of binding sites. In addition, we present electrophysiological evidence that synaptic transmission, as opposed to axonal conduction, is preferentially sensitive to the action of aconitine and veratridine. Finally, the synaptic block produced by these sodium channel activators is inhibited by phenytoin and carbamazepine at therapeutic anticonvulsant concentrations. Thus, these anticonvulsants may limit seizure spread not only by affecting all-or-none conduction by axonal sodium channels but also by modulating graded aspects of synaptic transmission...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{dedifferentiation}} was induced in Vicia faba root tissues {{by removing}} the whole root meristem (decapitation) and the behaviour of the nuclear DNA in the dedifferentiating cells was studied by means of cytophotometric and <b>autoradiographic</b> analyses. Cytophotometric <b>determination</b> after Feulgen-staining showed that: 1. {{the vast majority of}} nuclei in differentiated cells were in the DNA postsynthetic phase, but their Feulgen absorption was lower than that of DNA postsynthetic nuclei (G 2, 4 C) in the meristem; 2. such a Feulgen absorption was detected in certain nuclei after root decapitation; 3. all the mitoses in the dedifferentiating tissues were diploid, fully matching the Feulgen absorption of mitoses in the meristem. After 3 H-thymidine (3 H-T) feeding of the decapitated roots and autoradiography, the following results were obtained: 1. two populations of labeled nuclei, characterized by two different levels of scattered labeling occurred in dedifferentiating tissues, slightly labeled nuclei being much more numerous than heavily labeled nuclei; 2. the percentage of labeled nuclei was much greater than that of DNA presynthetic nuclei in the root tissues; 3. almost all the mitoses were labeled after a 16 -hour 3 H-T feeding; 4. the percentage of slightly labeled nuclei paralleled that of dedifferentiating cells; 5. the duration of the DNA synthesis phase and that of the gap between completion of DNA synthesis and mitosis differed in heavily and slightly labeled nuclei; 6. all nuclei which entered DNA synthesis also entered mitosis. These results are interpreted to mean that: 1. after decapitation, two different DNA syntheses occur in the dedifferentiating root tissues of V. faba: DNA reduplication in cells which dedifferentiate starting from a DNA presynthetic nuclear condition (heavily labeled nuclei) and extra DNA synthesis in cells which dedifferentiate starting from a DNA postsynthetic nuclear condition (slightly labeled nuclei); 2. extra DNA synthesis is required in these dedifferentiating cells for entry into mitosis...|$|R
