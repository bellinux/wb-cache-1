5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> the sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|After Jon {{discusses}} the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering more men and predicts that Ramsay will defeat them. Jon {{insists that the}} army is the largest one possible. When Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him if he dies in battle, she {{says that it is}} up to the Lord of Light. Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> they may have served the wrong king all along. Davos discovers the pyre where Shireen and the wooden stag he carved for her were burned.|$|E
5|$|Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson are {{credited}} with creating the Joker, but their {{accounts of the}} character's conception differ, each providing {{his own version of}} events. Finger's, Kane's, and Robinson's versions <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> Finger produced an image of actor Conrad Veidt in character as Gwynplaine (a man with a disfigured face, giving him a perpetual grin) in the 1928 film The Man Who Laughs as an inspiration for the Joker's appearance, and Robinson produced a sketch of a joker playing card (right).|$|E

5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that {{it is virtually impossible}} to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put participants at risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, revisionist {{authors would}} {{formulate}} accusations against Moreno, depicting {{him as a}} British agent and a man of mere theoretical European ideas without a strong relation with the South American context. Saavedra is depicted instead as a popular caudillo, a predecessor of José de San Martín and Juan Manuel de Rosas. This perspective did not <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> the wealthy citizens were aligned with Saavedra against Moreno, that Saavedra himself was wealthy and aristocratic, and that the 1811 revolution made no requests of a social nature, save {{for the removal of}} Morenist forces from the Junta.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Cornelio Saavedra {{is closely}} related to that of Mariano Moreno. As Saavedra had a {{conflict}} with him in the Junta, the perspectives towards him complement those about Moreno. The first liberal historians praised Moreno {{as the leader of the}} Revolution and a great historical man; Saavedra was treated either as a weak man overwhelmed by Moreno, or as a counter-revolutionary. This perspective did not <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> Saavedra, as head of the Regiment of Patricians, was the most popular and influential man of the city since before the Revolution, and that he was reported to be staunch, cunning and ruthless.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but {{in the last year of}} his life he relented and came to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
