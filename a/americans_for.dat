5|$|Activists {{have played}} a {{significant}} role in MSU history. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests helped create co-ed residence halls, and blocked the routing of Interstate 496 through campus. In the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the University to divest the stocks of companies doing business in apartheid South Africa from its endowment portfolio, such as Coca-Cola. | title=The Anti-Apartheid Act of 1985 | location=Washington | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | year=1985|page=213}} MSU has many student groups focused on political change. Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union and the Council of Graduate Students. Michigan State also has a variety of partisan groups ranging from liberal to conservative, including the College Republicans, the College Democrats and several third party organizations. Other partisan activist groups include Young <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> Freedom and Young <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> Liberty on the right; Young Democratic Socialists, Students for Economic Justice, Young Communist League and MEChA on the left. Given MSU's proximity to the Michigan state capital of Lansing, many politically inclined Spartans intern for state representatives.|$|E

5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of the GOP in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most Democrats in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E

5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups. On January 23, 2012, both candidates signed the agreement, or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by the agreement, both candidates agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups to a charity of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E

5|$|British consuls in the United States {{sought to}} enlist <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> the Crimean War in 1854, in {{violation}} of neutrality laws, and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls. To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, finally agreed to meet with the <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the bombing halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and <b>Americans</b> <b>for</b> Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E
