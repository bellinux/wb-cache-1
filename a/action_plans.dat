5|$|The plan {{came into}} force on June 28, 2012. After the {{establishment}} of the national action plan, British Columbia established a provincial action plan informed by the national one to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the federal government's. OCTIP then became involved in implementing the national and provincial <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> The provincial action plan, published in March 2013, states that contributing to development of the NAP-CHT through consultation and information sharing was an immediate priority.|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> is {{regarded}} as an important correlate and predictor of health behaviour, but {{little is known about}} antecedents of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Because personality constructs have been shown to moderate the effect of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> interventions, the present study tested associations of personality dimensions with <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and fruit consumption. Design and setting: Cross-sectional data collected with self-administered questionnaires in a university setting. Method: Undergraduate students (n = 443; mean age = 21. 45 (SD = 2. 96) years, 68. 7 % females) who participated for course credits and completed measures of personality dimensions, <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> intention, and fruit consumption based on validated questionnaires. The first set of analyses focused on antecedents of fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> employing stepwise regression analysis. The second set of analyses focused on intention and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as mediators of the personality-fruit consumption link using structural equation modelling. Results: Higher scores for fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> were found for more conscientiousness and less neurotic individuals. Further, more conscientious individuals consumed more fruits and this relationship was mediated by <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusion: Findings provide support for <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as a mediator in the Conscientiousness-fruit consumption link and suggest that personality influences may need {{to be taken into account}} when developing <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies aimed at increasing fruit consumption...|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E

40|$|Both habit {{strength}} and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> {{have been found}} to moderate the intention-exercise behaviour relationship, but no research exists that has investigated how habit {{strength and}} <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> simultaneously influence this relationship. The present study was designed to explore this issue in a prospective sample of undergraduate students (N = 415) : <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> habit strength, intention, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were assessed at baseline and exercise behaviour was assessed 2 weeks later. Both habit strength and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> moderated the intention-exercise relationship, with stronger relationship at higher levels of planning or habit strength. Decomposing a significant <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> × habit strength × intention interaction showed that the strength of the intention-exercise relationship progressed linearly through levels of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and habit strength. These novel results show that <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strengthens the intention-habit strength interaction in the exercise domain: exercise interventions should therefore focus on simultaneously bolstering <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and habit strength...|$|R
50|$|The 2008 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> further {{describes}} a national strategy {{to address the}} problem with hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and also improve the water quality in the Mississippi River. The 2008 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> was a reassessment called for in the 2001 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan.</b> The 2008 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> outlines the significance of completing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies, promoting these practices, and also increasing the awareness of the public of hypoxia in the Gulf. Included in the 2008 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> is a series of five Annual Operating Plans, one for each of the upcoming years until the next reassessment is necessary. These Operating Plans offer guidelines to keep the forward movement of completing <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> goals within those years. The 2008 <b>Action</b> <b>plan</b> also summarized the progress of the 2001 <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> up until that point. Although the goal of reducing the size of the hypoxia area to 5000 square kilometers was not met, the loadings of nitrogen from the Mississippi River were decreased by 12%.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed twice by British submarines; the first, in July 1941, necessitated {{three months of}} repairs. The second, in August 1942, caused {{extensive}} damage and ended the ship's career. She was eventually towed back to La Spezia, where repairs were to be completed. Resources were unavailable, however, and Bolzano remained there, out of <b>action.</b> <b>Plans</b> to convert her into a hybrid cruiser-aircraft carrier came to nothing for the same reason. After Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, La Spezia was occupied by German forces; {{to prevent them from}} using her as a blockship, Italian and British frogmen sank Bolzano using Chariot manned torpedoes in June 1944. The Italian Navy ultimately raised the ship in September 1949 and broke her up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Krueger did not {{immediately}} give Martin permission for such an operation. There was still the possibility of Japanese attack, and the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation. On 20 January, a visiting staff officer from Alamo Force was asked to raise the possibility with Krueger. However, on 21 January Martin received a letter stating that {{the mission of the}} Michaelmas Task Force remained unchanged and a radiogram was received on 22 January to the effect that this was not consistent with Krueger's wishes. On 8 February, Martin received a garbled radiogram from Krueger that indicated that the earlier restrictive message of 22 January had itself been garbled, and on 9 February a radiogram was received authorising offensive <b>action.</b> <b>Plans</b> were immediately made but on 10 February contact was made with elements of the Australian 5th Division, which had relieved the 9th Division on 20 January. This closed the gap on the east flank.|$|E
