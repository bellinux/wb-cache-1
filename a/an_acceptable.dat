50|$|Experiments of Dr. Goncharov and {{co-workers}} resulted in {{development of a}} successful therapeutic complex, containing a phenothiazine compound, a dioic acid compound, and <b>a</b> pharmaceutically <b>acceptable</b> carrier.

5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
40|$|A topically applied {{sunscreen}} {{composition is}} provided, which {{by use of}} nano-sized particles of a physical UV screening agent in <b>a</b> dermatologically <b>acceptable</b> carrier, provides <b>a</b> dermatologically <b>acceptable</b> level of SPF and broad-spectrum protection from UVA and UVB radiation without the need to include chemical UV screening agents in the composition...|$|R

5000|$|Dichotomous Modified Angoff Method (item-centered): In the dichotomous {{modified}} Angoff approach, {{instead of}} using difficulty level type statistics (typically p-values), SMEs are asked to simply provide a 0/1 for each question (“0” if <b>a</b> borderline <b>acceptable</b> participant would get the question wrong and “1” if <b>a</b> borderline <b>acceptable</b> participant would get the item right) ...|$|R
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> limit.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E

5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.|$|E

Sutcliffe was en route to South Africa with the MCC touring team, but was aware that Yorkshire were considering him as a replacement for Lupton.|$|E
5|$|Leopold's abdication {{message of}} 1 August 1950 was premised on a {{reconciliation}} {{in the person}} of his eldest son {{over the course of a}} year. Baudouin was seen by most parties as <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> alternative candidate. According to a law approved on 11 August, executive powers were transferred to Baudouin in advance of the official abdication. Leopold formally abdicated on 16 July 1951. His son succeeded him the following day.|$|E

5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding.

5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts with the King's Bench, the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload, in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary. Reaching <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> medium with the King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist, marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas.|$|E
