5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts.

5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, depicted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His {{hands and feet}} seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards.

5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona.

The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E

5|$|Robert Mark Realty {{bought the}} former station in 1986 and renovated it {{at a cost}} of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the {{architect}} who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor. The building's design follows a Shingle Style architecture and its sidings are both shingle and clapboard. There are bay windows on the east and west faces, and rafters are partly visible. The building served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> estate office.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was in such}} a state of disrepair by the 1980s that it was almost demolished, and the nearby tracks were torn up and sold for scrap by 1984. However, the station avoided demolition and was renovated in 1988. It was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> estate office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. In 1999, the station became an Italian restaurant and received its current name, La Stazione. The {{building was}} expanded in 2003 and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 mob film.|$|E
5|$|The native {{settlement}} of Tegucigalpa was first {{recorded by the}} Spanish in 1536. Spanish miners founded colonial Tegucigalpa in 1578, having headed south from Comayagua and discovered silver and other minerals in {{the mountains to the}} east of the native settlement. The colonial town was established <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> de minas, an administrative centre for controlling the mines, and where the ore was smelted. The town was in a bowl-shaped valley on the upper Choluteca River, close to the convergence of three tributary streams. Spanish Tegucigalpa was next to Comayagüela, which remained a purely indigenous settlement. Thanks to the local mineral wealth, Tegucigalpa grew rapidly in size as it attracted Spanish settlers and their native workers. The Franciscans established a convent there by 1592, and the Mercedarians established their own convent about four decades afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Eduardo Alberto Duhalde {{was born}} in Lomas de Zamora, in the Greater Buenos Aires. He {{graduated}} as a lawyer in 1970. He {{was elected to the}} city legislature the next year, and presided over it. He joined the Justicialist Party (PJ), and soon became leader of its local branch. He was elected to the local legislature of Lomas de Zamora, and appointed its president. The legislature impeached the mayor Ricardo Ortiz, as well as Pedro Turner, who was appointed mayor afterwards. This was part of a political reorganization promoted by President Juan Perón. Duhalde was appointed mayor in 1973 as a result. Many members of the Peronist Youth were killed in Lomas de Zamora during the Pasco massacre, which Duhalde blamed on the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance. He was ousted from office during the 1976 Argentine coup d'état. He worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> estate broker during the following years.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2009, it was {{announced}} that Lyon had reached an agreement with Spanish club Real Madrid for the transfer of Benzema. The transfer fee was priced at €35million with the fee rising to as much as €41million based on incentives. On 9 July, Benzema successfully passed his medical and signed his contract, a six-year deal, later that afternoon. He was presented officially <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> Madrid player later that night at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, similarly to the previous signings of Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo. Benzema made his Real Madrid debut on 20 July in the club's opening pre-season friendly against Irish club Shamrock Rovers in Dublin, appearing as a half-time substitute. He scored the lone goal in the club's 1–0 win, scoring in the 87th minute. On 24 August, Benzema netted two goals in Real Madrid's 4–0 victory over Norwegian club Rosenborg in an annual friendly tournament organized for the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy. The goals brought his total tally in the pre-season with Real Madrid to five, making him the joint top scorer alongside fellow striker Raúl.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{typically}} employed four legions each year, each {{consisting of}} 4,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry. Perceiving the Carthaginian army <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> threat, {{for the first}} time ever the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering the same amount of foot soldiers but 900 cavalry per legion-- more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions--some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry--formed the core of this massive new army. However, some have suggested that the destruction of an army of 90,000 troops would be impossible. They argue that Rome probably had 48,000 troops and 6,000 cavalry against Hannibal's 35,000 troops and 10,000 cavalry. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army. While no definitive number of Roman troops exists, all sources agree that the Carthaginians faced a considerably larger foe.|$|E
