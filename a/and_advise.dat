5|$|After {{a stormy}} debate {{in which the}} {{survival}} of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> on the implementation of social credit.

Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Government {{among the}} Yavapai {{tended to be}} informal. There were no tribal chiefs, such as Chief of the Guwevkabaya or Chief of the Ɖo:lkabaya. Certain men became {{recognized}} leaders based on others choosing to follow them, heed their advice, and support their decisions. Men who were noted for their skills as warriors were called mastava (″not afraid″) or bamulva (″person who goes forward″). Other warriors were willing to follow such men into combat. Some Yavapai men were noted for their wisdom and speaking ability. Called bakwauu (″person who talks″), they would settle disputes within the camp <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> others on the selection of campsites, work ethics, and food production.|$|E

5|$|At de Havilland he {{was awarded}} a salary of £1,500 in a company that had {{expanded}} enormously during the war. The number of employees rose from 5,000 to 38,000. The turnover of the company had gone from £1.5 million before the war to £25 million and was now supported by around 100 factories. Cunningham now took the title of chief test pilot of the de Havilland Engine Company {{under the supervision of}} Geoffrey de Havilland Jr. Cunningham served as a pilot and consultant in a series of deals with the Swedish Air Force and Swiss Air Force. Both countries were keen to employ him but Cunningham visited only to deliver <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> on the de Havilland Vampire and British airborne radar design. In 1990 the Swiss presented him with the spade-grip from the control column mounted on a wooden stand when they withdrew the last of their Vampires. When the Swedes retired the machine in 1997 he was invited to celebrate its 50 years of Swedish service.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> the studios when changes or cuts were required.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, {{as part of}} Operation Okra the Australian Army {{deployed}} a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) {{of approximately}} 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for operations to assist <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> Iraqi Security Forces following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The soldiers {{were expected to be}} deployed to Iraq when a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. The majority of the SOTG was reported to be made up of C Company, 2nd Commando Regiment. It began moving into Iraq in early November. The 2nd Commando Regiment was tasked with training the Iraq government's Counter Terrorism Service. Personnel from SOTG have also been involved in co-ordinating airstrikes remotely to assist Iraqi forces engaged in clearance operations. From September 2015, the strength of SOTG rotations were reduced to approximately 80 personnel.|$|E

5|$|Theobald's {{household}} {{included many}} young men of ability, including his successor Thomas Becket. Theobald {{was instrumental in the}} early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E

5|$|According to plan, Kléber {{made the}} first move, {{advancing}} south from Düsseldorf against Württemberg's wing of the Army of the Lower Rhine. On 1 June 1796, a division of Kléber's troops led by François Joseph Lefebvre seized a bridge over the Sieg from Michael von Kienmayer's Austrians at Siegburg. Meanwhile, a second French division under Claude-Sylvestre Colaud menaced the Austrian left flank. Württemberg retreated south to Uckerath but then fell back farther to a well-fortified position at Altenkirchen. On 4 June, Kléber defeated Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen, capturing 1,500 Austrian soldiers, 12 artillery pieces and four colors. Archduke Charles withdrew the Austrian forces from the Rhine's west bank and gave the Army of the Upper Rhine the principle responsibility to defend Mainz. After this setback, Charles replaced Württemberg with Wilhelm von Wartensleben, much to Württemberg's annoyance: the Duke returned to Vienna and offered the Aulic Council his persistent criticism of Charles' decisions <b>and</b> <b>advise</b> on how they could run the war better from the capital. Jourdan's main body crossed the Rhine on 10 June at Neuwied to join Kléber and the Army of Sambre and Meuse advanced to the Lahn River.|$|E

All of these roles are uniformed and for those volunteer roles from County level downwards training is required in the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion and advanced managerial skills to achieve their Wood Badge.|$|E
