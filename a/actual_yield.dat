Arriving in September, Fermi was {{appointed}} an {{associate director of the}} laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the [...] "Super" [...] (thermonuclear) bomb; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P.

Fermi observed the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. He paced off how far they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the <b>actual</b> <b>yield</b> was about 18.6 kilotons.|$|E
500|$|New Melones Dam has a {{very large}} storage {{capacity}} relative to the watershed that feeds it, as compared to other major reservoirs in California. The potential water yield, and thus the supply contracts, of the Melones Project were calculated based on stream flow data between 1922 and 1978; however, this period may have been somewhat wetter than the long-term average. The Bureau of Reclamation estimated the additional water yield per year as [...] but the <b>actual</b> <b>yield</b> has been closer to [...] As a result, the reservoir is often at a low water level because in most years demand is greater than supply. In the 38 years between 1978 and 2016, New Melones has only reached capacity five times, and only once (in 1983) has it reached {{the level of the}} spillway. Between 1987 and 1992 Reclamation was forced to purchase water from other agencies to fulfill New Melones' water obligations. Even so, the reservoir fell to a record low level of , 3.5% of capacity, on October 1, 1992. Conversely, the great storage capacity also means that New Melones can capture more flood runoff while other major California reservoirs must release it to maintain flood control space.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{yield of}} potato {{is defined as}} the theoretical yield that can be assessed for a well-adapted cultivar, grown from the best possible seed under optimal conditions. More than in crops that are grown from generative seeds, the growth, development, yield and quality of the potato crop are strongly influenced by the quality of the seed tubers, including their genetic, physical and physiological quality and their seed health status. Potato is very variable in maturity type: late cultivars can intercept large quantities of light whereas early cultivars show more efficient resource use. We describe potential and <b>actual</b> <b>yields</b> as well as impact of climate change on these yields, based on simple, robust models. Potential yields may be as high as 160 Mg ha- 1, in production systems with abundant irrigation, high radiation levels and long seasons. In such systems, <b>actual</b> <b>yields</b> of above 120 Mg ha- 1 are feasible. However, potato is also grown as a short-cycle crop and in those conditions potential and <b>actual</b> <b>yields</b> are much lower. Potential yields might not change much in potato over time, but there is still a large gap between <b>actual</b> and potential <b>yields</b> to fill. The ratio between <b>actual</b> and potential <b>yield</b> ranges from 10 to 75 %, but typical values are between 30 and 40 %, although they obviously depend on the level of input. These ratios allow great yield improvements provided inputs are economically feasible in practice and if climate change does not interfere. In most countries, yields of potato might increase by climate change, provided water supply remains adequate. Main changes through climate change will probably occur by changes in the number of growing days per crop cycle. In some areas with abundant potato production, such as the Indo-Gangetic plains, however, climate change might reduce yield because of a reduction in number of growing days, but it has been projected that the effects of climate change on potato will be regionally divers...|$|R

40|$|The precise {{spatially}} explicit {{knowledge about}} crop yield potentials and yield gaps {{is essential to}} guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. In this study, the maize yield potentials from 1980 to 2008 across the major maize production regions of China were firstly estimated by county using ensemble simulation of a well-validated large scale crop model, i. e., MCWLA-Maize model. Then, the temporal and spatial patterns of maize yield potentials and yield gaps during 1980 - 2008 were presented and analyzed. The results showed that maize yields became stagnated at 32. 4 % of maize-growing areas during the period. In the major maize production regions, i. e., northeastern China, the North China Plain (NCP) and southwestern China, yield gap percentages were generally less than 40 % and particularly less than 20 % in some areas. By contrast, in northern and southern China, where <b>actual</b> <b>yields</b> were relatively lower, yield gap percentages were generally larger than 40 %. The areas with yield gap percentages less than 20 % and less than 40 % accounted for 8. 2 % and 27. 6 % of maize-growing areas, respectively. During the period, yield potentials decreased in the NCP and southwestern China due to increase in temperature and decrease in solar radiation; by contrast, increased in northern, northeastern and southeastern China due to increases in both temperature and solar radiation. Yield gap percentages decreased generally by 2 % per year across the major maize production regions, although increased in some areas in northern and northeastern China. The shrinking of yield gap was due to increases in <b>actual</b> <b>yields</b> and decreases in yield potentials in the NCP and southwestern China; and due to larger increases in <b>actual</b> <b>yields</b> than in yield potentials in northeastern and southeastern China. The results highlight the importance of sustainable intensification of agriculture to close yield gaps, as well as breeding new cultivars to increase yield potentials, to meet the increasing food demand.
