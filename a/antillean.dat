5|$|Annual Carnival {{celebrations}} are {{an important}} part of the culture of all the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-Lent, Christmastime or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British <b>Antillean</b> islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as French Saint Martin and elsewhere. The British <b>Antillean</b> Carnivals are also mostly united by the J'ouvert tradition, which involves calypso and soca band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.|$|E
5|$|French Creole {{music is}} most famously {{associated}} with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though {{the islands of}} Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French <b>Antillean</b> music.

The quadrille is a potent symbol of French <b>Antillean</b> culture.|$|E

50|$|Zouk {{was a brief}} experiment; {{an attempt}} to develop a proper local music that should lessen or even {{eradicate}} the méringue-kadans or compas influence from the French Antilles. When the MIDI technology came out, Kassav' used it fully, creating new sound in both their fast zouk béton and kompa. The <b>Antilleans</b> were all over with zouk but as other bands from the Caribbean and Africa added the MIDI technology to their music, people got used to it. Because it was a jump up beat, the fast zouk béton faded away, and <b>Antilleans</b> continue to play and dance méringue-cadence or compas.|$|R

After all, French <b>Antilleans</b> and Dominicans are important players of the style. However, the problem is that musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe have calculatedly labeled compas as zouk in order to remain on the map (keeping in mind Compas was created in 1950 by Haitians); creating a big confusion in Africa, Cabo Verde, Angola, Bresil, Portugal and other places. Kassav', the originator of the zouk béton, is a compas music band that has taken compas to many places, and is the only band that continues to include zouk béton in its repertoire, though to a lesser extent.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} differences in sibling relationships among native Dutch and immigrant {{groups in the}} Netherlands. It uses a large national dataset to compare adult sibling relationships among Moroccan, Turkish, Caribbean and native Dutch groups, focusing on the varying importance of gender composition and age structure for the sibling relationship in the ethnic minority groups and the native Dutch families. Results show that, on average, ethnic minorities in the Netherlands have more involved sibling relationships in adulthood, with more contact, more emotional support, practical support (except Turks and <b>Antilleans),</b> a higher relationship quality, but also more conflict (among the Turks and <b>Antilleans)</b> compared to the Dutch. Gender constellation and hierarchical position were not of equal influence in all groups, although no clear patterns emerged...|$|R
5|$|The Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw or Guadeloupe macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> island region of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term <b>Antillean</b> music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone <b>Antillean</b> music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
50|$|Afrikaanderwijk is a {{neighborhood}} of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. It lies in the Feijenoord district of the city, and is traditionally a working-class neighborhood.

Understandable and truthful as this may be, I argue in this essay that we need to develop a language that does not unwittingly reinforce the ethno-racial divide between Aboriginal Dutch (the so-called natives) and Dutch <b>Antilleans.</b> Employing an autoethnographic account—autobiography enriched by ethnographically based sociological analysis—I present an alternative picture where the agency of Dutch <b>Antilleans</b> in their quest to transform the Netherlands into a hospitable multiculture is highlighted. The richness of life that they are helping bring about, which crosscuts and continuously unravels the racialized Manichean representation of the Netherlands, needs to complement the existing writings on the secondarization of the Caribbean Diaspora in the West...|$|R
5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within the Netherlands Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch <b>Antillean</b> athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch <b>Antillean</b> athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch <b>Antillean</b> athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch <b>Antillean</b> NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from {{abundant}} skeletal elements, which document {{it as the}} largest known oryzomyine, on par with Megalomys desmarestii, another <b>Antillean</b> endemic. Its morphological features indicate that it is distinct from Megalomys, which includes various other <b>Antillean</b> oryzomyines, and derives from a separate colonization of the Lesser Antilles by oryzomyines. In the original description, it was placed close to a species now placed in Nephelomys, but its relationships have not been studied since.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2015, Lenoble {{reviewed}} overlooked historical Spanish and French sources, finding {{references to}} mainly red macaws {{consistent with the}} Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw. The writings of the French missionary Raymond Breton (on Guadeloupe from 1635 to 1654) were especially illuminating, as they showed that both he and the native Island Caribs clearly distinguished between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaws from the mainland, which supports {{the idea that the}} Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw represents an independent species. As the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> Carib language had different words reserved for men and women, Breton gave the name of the bird as Kínoulou (♂) and Caarou (♀). Lenoble furthermore concluded that the supposed violet macaw (named Anodorhynchus purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from Guadeloupe) was based on misidentified references to the also-extinct Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea), and therefore never existed.|$|E
50|$|The Haitian cadence and its compas {{has been}} {{dominating}} the Antilles music scene since its introduction {{in the late}} 1950s. Compas direct is a modern méringue popularized in 1955 by the Nemours Jean-Baptiste, a Haitian saxophone and guitar player, which was appropriated by the <b>Antilleans</b> who labeled their version cadence-lypso and later, zouk or zouk-love.|$|R
50|$|Netherlands Antilles was not {{eligible}} to participate separately in the parade, as its National Olympic Committee {{was no longer}} recognized by the IOC due to the 2010 dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. However, Dutch <b>Antilleans</b> paraded independently under the Olympic flag, together with a South Sudanese runner whose newly independent country {{did not yet have}} an Olympic committee.|$|R
50|$|A large {{percentage}} of the Netherlands <b>Antilleans</b> descended from European colonists and African slaves who were brought and traded here from the 17th to 19th centuries. The rest of the population originated from other Caribbean islands as well as Latin America, East Asia and elsewhere in the world. In Curaçao there was a strong Jewish element going back to the 17th century.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, <b>Antillean</b> {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the <b>Antillean</b> music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|The American {{zoologist}} Austin Hobart Clark {{gave the}} Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw its scientific name, Ara guadeloupensis, in 1905, {{based on the}} contemporary accounts, and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species. He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw (A. macao), {{as well as the}} green-winged macaw (A. chloropterus) and the Cuban macaw (A. tricolor). Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique, based on accounts of red macaws there, as well as on Guadeloupe. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species, and that the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw was confined to Guadeloupe. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population, but this is difficult to prove. Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola. According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume, the similarity between the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives, and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw.|$|E

50|$|Most Netherlands <b>Antilleans</b> were Dutch {{citizens}} and this status permitted and encouraged {{the young and}} university-educated to emigrate to the Netherlands.

5|$|The bat {{species that}} occur in the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico are: greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus), <b>Antillean</b> ghost-faced bat (Mormoops blainvillii), Parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii), sooty mustached bat (Pteronotus quadridens), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), <b>Antillean</b> fruit bat (Brachyphylla cavernarum), buffy flower bat (Erophylla sezekorni bombifrons), Leach's single leaf bat (Monophyllus redmani), red fruit bat (Stenoderma rufum), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), velvety free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus), and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis).|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a {{terminal}} phalanx bone (ungual claw bone) {{attributable to the}} genus Ara from south-western Marie-Galante was described by ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble. It was discovered in the Blanchard Cave during excavations in 2013-2014, in a fossil-bearing deposit dating to the late Pleistocene epoch. The deposit was radiocarbon dated to about 10,690 years ago; the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area has been dated to 5,300 years ago. This confirmed that the Guadeloupe region once had an endemic macaw which {{could not have been}} brought there by humans. All other macaw bones from the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> islands have been recovered from archaeological sites, and could therefore have been the remains of birds brought there by Amerindians. The size of the phalanx bone matched what was described for the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw by contemporary writers, and the authors therefore correlated the two. They conceded that this connection could only be tentative, as there were no remains of the Lesser <b>Antillean</b> macaw to compare with.|$|E

50|$|In November 1903, the {{construction}} of the Panama Canal began. 50,000 workers were imported from Jamaica, Martinique, Barbados and Trinidad. The workers were referred to as <b>Antilleans</b> or derisively as chombos. <b>Antilleans</b> and other black workers were paid less than white workers. Discrimination was rampant. Most supervisors were from the southern US, and implemented a type of southern segregation. The presence of West Indians had other repercussions. Creoles and mestizos who had a social status above blacks were lumped with them. They were deeply offended and engaged in rampant discrimination of all blacks outside the general canal local. This led to great racial tension. Native blacks began to resent the West Indians, who they felt made things worse for them. In 1914, the Panama Canal was completed. 20,000 West Indians remained in the country. They generated a lot of xenophobia. In 1926, Panama passed laws decreasing immigration from the West Indies and later barring non-Spanish speaking blacks from entering the country.|$|R
5|$|The Netherlands Antilles were a {{union of}} five Caribbean islandsCuraçao, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, Saba and Sint Maartenthat, together, {{constituted}} {{a portion of the}} Realm of the Netherlands alongside the Netherlands themselves and Aruba, and held approximately 300,000 residents. The political power of the Dutch colonies was centered at Willemstad, the capital of both Curaçao and of the Netherlands Antilles. The first Dutch <b>Antillean</b> delegation to compete was an eleven-man team that arrived at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Excluding 1956 and 1980, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles had participated at twelve summer games between 1952 and 2004. It had additionally competed at the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992.

40|$|Objective: Previously {{we found}} that the {{incidence}} of anorexia nervosa (AN) in the general population was much lower in the Netherlands Antilles than in the Netherlands. As a follow-up we compared the incidence of AN in the Netherlands in persons from the Netherlands Antilles to native Dutch. Method: A national register of psychiatric hospital admissions was screened for cases of AN. Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed. Results: The IR of AN was 1. 32 per 100 000 person years (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 53 - 2. 71) for Netherlands <b>Antilleans</b> and 1. 09 (95 % CI: 1. 04 - 1. 15) for native Dutch. The age-and sex-adjusted IRR was 1. 21 (95 % CI: 0. 58 - 2. 54). Conclusion: Contrary to the Netherlands Antilles, in the Netherlands AN is as common among Netherlands <b>Antilleans</b> as among native Dutch. Exposure to the Western idealization of thinness is a risk factor for the development of AN, possibly in interaction with migration-related stress.
