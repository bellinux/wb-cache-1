40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{techniques}} {{is being developed}} to postprocess noisy, multifont, nonformatted OCR data on a word basis to 1) determine if a field is alphabetic or numeric; 2) verify that an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>word</b> is legitimate; 3) fetch from a dictionary a set of potential entries using a garbled word as a key; and 4) error-correct the garbled word by selecting the most likely dictionary word. Four algorithms were developed using a technique called vector processing (representing alphabetic words as numeric vectors) and also by applying Bayes maximum likelihood solutions to correct the OCR output. The result was {{the development of a}} software simulator which processed sequential fields generated by the Advanced Optical Character Reader (in use by the U. S. Postal Service in New York City), performed the four functions indicated above, and selected the correct <b>alphabetic</b> <b>word</b> from a dictionary of 62000 entries. 1...|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that the visual analysis of Chinese characters by skilled readers is based upon well-defined orthographic constituents. These functional units are the recurrent, integral stroke-patterns, not the individual strokes as previously thought. The speed of simultaneous "same-different" comparisons of Chinese characters {{is affected by the}} number of these orthographic units and, for "different" judgements, by the proportion of mismatching units, but not by the number of individual strokes. We further define a category of orthographic unit, referred to here as the "lexical radical", which requires strict positional regularity within each composite character. Violation of positional regularity results in illegal non-characters. In contrast, recombination of orthographic units (stroke patterns) with the lexical radical in its regular position forms a regular pseudocharacter. We show that real characters are matched faster than pseudocharacters and non-characters - a word superiority effect in Chinese. Pseudocharacters are matched faster than non-characters, a pseudoword advantage in Chinese. We also present evidence suggesting that individual stroke patterns may be better recognized in real characters than in pseudocharacters and non-characters - a word superiority effect in terms of unit recognition. These results support the hypothesis that the functional orthographic unit in the recognition of Chinese characters, comparable to the letter in <b>alphabetic</b> <b>word</b> recognition, is the recurring integral stroke pattern...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a lexical and {{grammatical}} investigation of the 2   200 instances of swearing in a corpus of 45 plays from the 18 th, 19 th and 20 th centuries, brought together within the re­search project Drama dialogue through three centuries at the Department of Scandinavian Languages at Uppsala University. The report comprises two main sections, the latter being an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>word</b> list, ex­tensively accounting for the different swear words and the conventionalized expressions these words take part in. The articles of the word list include grammatical classifications, meanings/pragmatic functions and etymologies. Being an account of a certain corpus, the articles also list the orthographic variants of the words/expressions used in the plays {{as well as their}} distribution on syntactic functions, with the actual number of instances specified, play by play. Every syntactic function of a word or an expression is also illu­strated by at least one characteristic example from the corpus. The prerequisites of the word list, e. g. the definition of swearing, complicated etymo­logies and the non-standard syntactic functions of swear words, are discussed in the first section of the report. This section also contains a number of diachronic analyses, mainly based on quantitative comparisons between the swearing in plays dating from the six dif­ferent sub periods that constitute the corpus. Thus, the frequency over time of swearing as a whole, {{as well as of the}} relative frequency of different kinds of swear words (e. g. celesti­al words versus diabolic, euphemisms versus non-euphemisms) and the shifting popularity of individual swear words, have been studied. Furthermore, grammatical investigations have been carried through. Among other things, it is shown how some expressions grammaticalize and develop new patterns for their distribution on syntactic functions...|$|E
40|$|In two experiments, we {{investigated}} whether visual field (VF) asymmetries of spatial cueing {{are involved in}} reading parafoveal Chinese characters. These characters are different from linearly arranged <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words</b> {{in that they are}} logograms that are confined to a constant, square-shaped area and are composed of only a few radicals. We observed a cueing effect, but it did not vary with the VF in which the Chinese character was presented, regardless of whether the cue validity (the ratio of validly to invalidly cued targets) was 1 : 1 or 7 : 3. These results suggest that VF asymmetries of spatial cueing do not affect the reading of parafoveal Chinese characters, contrary to the reading of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words.</b> The mechanisms of spatial attention in reading parafoveal English-like words and Chinese characters are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Wholesale {{loans are}} almost {{invariably}} {{discussed in the}} Chinese-language literature under the umbrella term 字母词 zìmǔcí ‘lettered words’ or ‘alphabetic words’. This term basically includes any expression whose written form in Chinese texts contains at least one Latin letter and unfortunately masks some quite important differences between {{the various types of}} words that make up this large and heterogeneous group, differences pertaining to etymology, internal structure and pronunciation. Lettered or <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words</b> {{have been the subject of}} research by numerous linguists; indeed, there has been a veritable spate of literature commenting on this language change phenomenon. The term “lettered words” or “alphabetic words” covers a multitude of sins in the literature and thus is clearly in need of careful and structured analysis. As mentioned above, previous research (Cook 2014; Ding et al. 2017; Huang and Liu 黄居仁,刘洪超 2017) has demonstrated that one fundamental distinction that needs to be made is between <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words</b> that are borrowed directly from a European language and those that are coined by native speakers of Modern Standard Chinese. Within each of these two major groups, further subcategorization is also necessary.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that reading <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words</b> is dominated by phonological (sound-based) processes, whereas phonological processes {{do not appear to}} dominate the processing of Chinese logographs, where visual processes are more pronounced (for reviews, see Tavassoli, in press; Zhou & Marslen-Wilson, 1999). Most previous demonstrations of these linguistic differences have relied on low-level processes that potentially do not involve short-term memory.

40|$|AbstractHow are Chinese {{characters}} {{recognized and}} {{represented in the}} brain of skilled readers? Functional MRI fast adaptation technique was used to address this question. We found that neural adaptation effects were limited to identical characters in bilateral ventral visual system while no activation reduction was observed for partially overlapping characters regardless of the spatial location of the shared sub-character components, suggesting highly selective neuronal tuning to whole characters. The consistent neural profile across the entire ventral visual cortex indicates that Chinese characters are represented as mutually distinctive wholes rather than combinations of sub-character components, which presents a salient contrast to the left-lateralized, simple-to-complex neural representations of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words.</b> Our findings thus revealed the cultural modulation effect on both local neuronal activity patterns and functional anatomical regions associated with written symbol recognition. Moreover, the cross-language discrepancy in written symbol recognition mechanism might stem from the language-specific early-stage learning experience...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{show that}} written English words and Chinese characters require {{different types of}} language processing (Hoosain & Osgood, 1983; Cheng, Yung, & Ng, 1988) as <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words</b> are based on spelling-to-sound rules, contrary to Chinese characters. However, the present experiment suggests that English and Chinese are both processed phonetically in immediate memory tasks and memory traces are represented at the phonemic level, which supports the Auto-Associative Neural Network model of short-term memory (Chappel & Humphreys, 1994). The experiment replicates Tehan and Humphreys' (1998) third experiment but with Chinese characters and English words. Furthermore, the pattern of interference appears to be different for Chinese and English dominant subjects. Particularly, phonological interference is larger for the English dominant group in both Chinese and English tasks. It is suggested that English dominant group used mainly a phonetic coding strategy whilst the Chinese group used a visual/phonetic strategy. A second study {{will be carried out}} to study coding differences between Chinese, mixed and English dominant subjects and the relationship between phonological coding and reading comprehension...|$|R

40|$|We {{used the}} {{activation}} likelihood estimation (ALE) method to quantitatively synthesize data from 19 published brain mapping studies of phonological processing in reading, six with Chinese and 13 with alphabetic languages. It demonstrated high concordance of cortical activity across multiple studies in each written language {{system as well}} as significant differences of activation likelihood between languages. Four neural systems for the phonological processing of Chinese characters included: (1) a left dorsal lateral frontal system at Brodmann area (BA) 9; (2) the dorsal aspect of left inferior parietal system; (3) a bilateral ventral-occipitotemporal system including portions of fusiform gyrus and middle occipital gyms; and (4) a left ventral prefrontal system covering the superior aspect of inferior frontal gyrus. For phonological processing of written <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words,</b> cortical areas identified here {{are consistent with the}} three neural systems proposed previously in the literature: (1) a ventral prefrontal system involving superior portions of left inferior frontal gyrus; (2) a left dorsal temporoparietal system including mid-superior temporal gyri and the ventral aspect of inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal region); and (3) a left ventral occipitotemporal system. Contributions of each of these systems to phonological processing in reading were discussed, and a covariant learning hypothesis is offered to account for the findings that left middle frontal gyrus is responsible for addressed phonology in Chinese whereas left temporoparietal regions mediate assembled phonology in alphabetic languages.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first automatic date processing system developed on a Canadian real-life standard cheque database. This system can process unconstrained handwritten dates written in English or in French, {{and it can}} also be applied to the recognition of any handwritten dates with similar format on many other kinds of documents. A knowledge-based module has been proposed for the date segmentation and a new cursive month word recognition system has also been implemented based on a combination of classifiers. The interaction between the segmentation and recognition stages has been properly established by using a multi-hypotheses generation and evaluation module. In addition, a verification module with two levels is designed in the postprocessing stage to correct some errors and reject invalid results, which further improves the reliability of the system. The segmentation of the date zone can be implemented in the knowledge-based segmentation module, the multi-hypotheses generation and evaluation module, or the verification module. An effective neural network ensemble system is proposed in this knowledge extraction stage to differentiate handwritten <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words</b> from numeric strings (A/N). We investigate the use of effective features extensively, and propose several new methods in the design of neural networks, creation of neural network ensembles, and combination methods for the ensembles created. For date recognition, the new cursive month word recognizer is implemented by combining a Hidden Markov Model classifier (HMM) with two Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to develop and {{implement}} an English language Text-to-Speech synthesis system. This involved a study of mechanisms of human speech production, a review of techniques in speech synthesis, and analysis of tests used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} synthesized speech. It was determined that a diphone synthesis system was the most effective choice for the scope of this project. A method of automatically identifying and extracting diphones from prompted speech was designed, allowing for the creation of a diphone database by a speaker in less than 40 minutes. CMUdict was used to determine the pronunciation of known words. A system for smoothing the transitions between diphone recordings was designed and implemented. CMUdict was then used to train a maximum-likelihood prediction system to determine the correct pronunciation of unknown English language <b>alphabetic</b> <b>words.</b> Then, a Part Of Speech tagger was designed to find the lexical class of words within a sentence. A method of altering the pitch, duration, and volume of the produced voice over time was designed, being a combination of the TD-PSOLA algorithm and a novel approach referred to as Unvoiced Speech Duration Shifting. This minimises distortion of the voice when shifting the pitch or duration, while maximising computational efficiency by operating in the time domain. This approach was used to add correct lexical stress to vowels within words. A text tokenisation system was developed to handle arbitrary text input, allowing pronunciation of numerical input tokens and use of appropriate pauses for punctuation. Methods for further improving sentence level speech naturalness were discussed. Finally, the system was tested with listeners for its intelligibility and naturalness.

40|$|Extract] Recent {{research}} has implicated different mental {{operations in the}} processing of alphabetic and logographic languages. For example, native Chinese (as opposed to English) speakers appear to directly access {{the meaning of a}} written word without the need for phonological coding (Chen et al., 2008; Zhou & Marslen-Wilson, 2009), and different brain structures are involved when processing <b>alphabetic</b> and logographic <b>words</b> (Kim & Kim, 2006). In this chapter, we give a brief overview of two fundamental issues in the representations of languages in memory: (a) the nature of memory representations in alphabetic versus logographic languages, and (b) activation of memory representations in bilingual speakers (and in particular, bilingual speakers of both alphabetic and logographic languages). We illustrate how a proactive interference paradigm has been applied in these areas using English–Chinese bilinguals from Singapore...|$|R

40|$|Hong Kong’s {{language}} education goals {{include the}} achievement of biliteracy in two very different writing systems: traditional Chinese characters and the alphabetic English script. Each of these orthographies poses a completely different cognitive challenge to its learners, yet both are introduced, side-by-side, to pre-school Cantonese-speaking children in the territory’s kindergartens. In the case of English, such premature literacy instruction often occurs without a conversational familiarity with the language, and usually in the complete absence of any pre-literacy phonemic awareness skills. As a consequence, most Hong Kong students have learned to read the English alphabetic script in inefficient, non-phonological ways. In a variety of teaching and testing situations, this study explored the nature {{and the extent of}} these phonological skill-deficits in 778 high-school students {{from a wide range of}} schools. The vast majority of them found difficulty in either reading or spelling pseudowords - a giveaway indicator of a poor grasp of <b>alphabetic</b> principles. <b>Word</b> Wizards©, an action-research teaching intervention programme, was devised to address this apparent paucity of phonological knowledge in a group of 79 fifteen- and sixteen-year-old Hong Kong learners of English. This three-week word-study programme was designed to heighten the students’ meta-linguistic awareness of the internal structures of English words. This study has illuminated a largely unrecognised, but absolutely fundamental problem in language education in Hong Kong – that the government’s espoused goal of biliteracy for all will require two distinctly different pedagogical pathways. The majority of the territory’s English language learners are being taught to follow an inefficient, overly visual, memory-based approach to alphabetic language literacy, which leaves them with very few phonological insights and a widespread inability to decode new words. Such problems have started to come to the attention of language researchers in those overseas universities which have significant numbers of students from Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|This study {{generally}} endeavoured {{to explore}} the development of literacy acquisition in Persian first language learners. To achieve this goal, {{the study did not}} focus on a narrow range of variables. There was a strong need for multivariate research taking into consideration phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge and working memory. The study comprised five phases. Phase One addressed the interrelation and development of two levels of phonological awareness: syllable awareness and phoneme awareness. Phase Two focused on the interrelation and development of various levels of orthographic knowledge including <b>alphabetic</b> knowledge, reading <b>words,</b> reading nonwords, spelling words, spelling nonwords, orthographic choice as well as the use of analogy and phonology in reading and spelling of nonwords. An attempt was made in Phase Three to examine the development of working memory. In Phase Four, the interrelation and contribution of phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge and working memory to reading and spelling achievement were surveyed jointly and individually. In the final phase, Phase Five, the factoring of all variables together and their functions in group distinction were determined. The sample consisted of 156 Persian-speaking students: 21 kindergartners, 121 elementary students enrolled in Grades one to five, and 14 undergraduate university students.

40|$|How {{language}} experience affects visual word recognition {{has been}} a topic of i ntense interest. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study compared the early electrophysiological responses (i. e., N 1) to familiar and unfamiliar writings under different conditions. Thirteen native Chinese speakers (with English as their second language) were recruited to passively view four types of scripts: Chinese (familiar logographic writings), English (familiar alphabetic writings), Korean Hangul (unfamiliar logographic writings), and Tibetan (unfamiliar alphabetic writings). Stimuli also differed in lexicality (words vs. non-words, for familiar writings only), length (characters/letters vs. words), and presentation duration (100  ms vs. 750  ms). We found {{no significant differences between}} words and non-words, and the effect of language experience (familiar vs. unfamiliar) was significantly modulated by stimulus length and writing system, and to a less degree, by presentation duration. That is, the language experience effect (i. e., a stronger N 1 response to familiar writings than to unfamiliar writings) was significant only for alphabetic letters, but not for <b>alphabetic</b> and logographic <b>words.</b> The difference between Chinese characters and unfamiliar logographic characters was significant under the condition of short presentation duration, but not under the condition of long presentation duration. Long stimuli elicited a stronger N 1 response than did short stimuli, but this effect was significantly attenuated for familiar writings. These results suggest that N 1 response might not reliably differentiate familiar and unfamiliar writings. More importantly, our results suggest that N 1 is modulated by visual, linguistic, and task factors, which has important implications for the visual expertise hypothesis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.
