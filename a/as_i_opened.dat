5|$|Marla F. Prather {{observed}} that Whaam!s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its {{position as a}} historic work of pop art. With <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Opened</b> Fire, Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, Whaam! {{is regarded as the}} culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with Drowning Girl, as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, {{as one of the most}} famous works of pop art. Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic pop art images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the World Book Encyclopedia used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and Whaam! to illustrate its Pop art entry.|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein {{studied as}} an artist before and after serving in the United States Army during World War II. He practiced {{anti-aircraft}} drills during basic training, and he was sent for pilot training but the program was canceled before it started. Among the topics he tackled after the war were romance and war. [...] He depicted aerial combat in several works. Whaam! {{is part of a}} series on war that he worked on between 1962 and 1964, and along with <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Opened</b> Fire (1964) is one of his two large war-themed paintings.|$|E

500|$|Whaam! {{is one of}} Lichtenstein's {{series of}} war images, {{typically}} combining vibrant colors with an expressive narrative. Whaam! is very large, measuring 1.7 m × 4.0 m (5ft 7 in × 13ft 4 in). It is less abstract than <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Opened</b> Fire, another of his war scenes. Lichtenstein employs his usual comic-book style: stereotyped imagery in bright primary colors with black outlines, coupled with imitations of mechanical printer's Ben-Day dots. The use of these dots, which were invented by Benjamin Day to simulate color variations and shading, are considered Lichtenstein's [...] "signature method". Whaam! departs from Lichtenstein's earlier diptychs such as Step-on-Can with Leg and Like New, in that the panels are not two variations of the same image.|$|E
