5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tucumán, Tristán garrisoned {{at the city}} of Salta with 2,500 men.

The Battle of Salta, the first battle with the new approved banner, was a decisive victory, ending with the capitulation of Pío Tristán and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> good qualities to have come from his mother and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E

5|$|As with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Brushstrokes works, {{it is in}} part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
