5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (<b>As</b> <b>Much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them {{back from the dead}} they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|Of the 18 presidential candidates, Tihipko has {{declared}} the biggest income to the Ukrainian election Committee. He had {{an income of}} about $2.5 million in 2008 and told Kyiv Post he had spent roughly the same amount on his presidential campaign till December 2009. “I will spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> need.

25|$|Arriving at Oxford {{just after}} the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American {{students}} who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E
25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches.

500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} almost <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience {{was a lot of}} people who didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E

What I could do was getting more limited so the role that I play is so different from what it could have been, due to my surprise pregnancy".

Between that and my four children, I don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E

When Gilligan turned in his script, he told series creator Chris Carter that the episode was [...] "the best work I'm ever gonna [...] do for you." [...] Carter retorted that the writers for the show should always [...] "better yourself" [...] by trying to out-do their last scripting effort.
