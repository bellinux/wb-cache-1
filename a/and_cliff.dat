5|$|Styles {{for these}} sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface <b>and</b> <b>cliff</b> dwellings, {{included}} T-shaped windows and doors. This {{has been taken}} by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, {{as evidence of the}} continuing reach of the Chacoan system.

5|$|The services' {{association}} with 1960s musicians is remembered {{in a set}} of photographs published in 2008 of the Stones stopping at Watford Gap on the way to ATV Studios, Birmingham in 1963. In 2009, Roadchef paid a former employee £1,000 for autographs he had collected while working there, including those of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Dusty Springfield <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> Richard. In July 2011, music journalist Peter Paphides presented Late Nights at the Blue Boar, a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the connection between the services and Britain's 1960s rock bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock <b>and</b> <b>cliff</b> {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{features of the}} park are the sandstone pagoda landscapes <b>and</b> <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> canyons. Limestone outcrops, karsts and elevated swamps are other unusual features.|$|R

5|$|The same year, Arsenal became {{embroiled in}} a scandal; footballers' pay {{at the time was}} limited by a maximum wage, but an FA enquiry found that Charlie Buchan had {{secretly}} received illegal payments from Arsenal as an incentive to sign for the club. Sir Henry Norris was indicted for his part and banned from football, but Chapman escaped punishment, and with the autocratic Norris replaced by the more benign Samuel Hill-Wood, Chapman's power and influence within the club increased, allowing him control over all aspects of the club's business. He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.|$|E
5|$|Whittaker enjoyed {{immediate}} success, {{winning the}} League title in 1947–48; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were {{top of the}} table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given {{the age of the}} Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> Holton. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949–50, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|At Everton, Johnson {{was part}} of a forward line spearheaded by record-breaking goalscorer Dixie Dean. In Johnson's first full season Everton won the Second Division Championship, and in his second the club won the First Division, {{becoming}} the English champions. The following season Everton reached the 1933 FA Cup Final, where Johnson faced his former club Manchester City. Everton were comfortable victors, winning 3–0, and seven years after suffering defeat in an FA Cup final Johnson gained a winners medal. Accounts of the match suggest Johnson had a quiet game, with reports focusing on the play of Dixie Dean <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> Britton. The final was the first to use shirt numbers to identify the players, Johnson becoming the competition's first number 10. During his Everton career Johnson won a further three England caps. Johnson scored twice in a 7–1 victory over Spain in 1931. John William Smith and Sammy Crooks also scored braces while Dixie Dean scored the other goal.|$|E

5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.|$|E
5|$|The {{last game}} of the Browns' regular season was a 66–14 win over the Dodgers. Nine {{different}} Cleveland players scored touchdowns in the game. The Browns' point total set an AAFC scoring record. Groza kicked a field goal to reach 13 for the season, exceeding Driscoll's all-time record. He also kicked four extra points, bringing his total for the season to 45 and beating the previous professional record of 42. Groza, however, injured his left ankle {{in the third quarter}} while making a tackle and had to be carried off the field. Substituting for Groza, Chet Adams kicked through five more extra points. Otto Graham played {{less than half of the}} game as Cleveland built a large lead, <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> Lewis and Bud Schwenk substituted for him in the second half. The Browns ended the game with several injured players at key positions. In addition to Groza, halfbacks Ray Terrell, Don Greenwood and Al Akins had to sit out because of injuries. The win gave Cleveland a 12–2 record as they prepared to face the Yankees in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is {{situated}} on the Isle of Thanet, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became silted up. The area {{to the west of}} the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs <b>and</b> <b>cliff</b> stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
