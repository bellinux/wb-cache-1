40|$|Grid is a {{distributed}} {{high performance}} computing paradigm that offers {{various types of}} resources (like computing, storage, communication) to resource-intensive user tasks. These tasks are scheduled to allocate available Grid resources efficiently to achieve high system throughput and to satisfy user requirements. The task scheduling problem has become more complex with the ever increasing size of Grid systems. Even though selecting an efficient resource allocation strategy for a particular task helps in obtaining a desired level of service, researchers still face difficulties in choosing a suitable technique from a plethora of existing methods in literature. In this paper, we explore and discuss existing resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for resource <b>allocation</b> problems employed in Grid systems.

40|$|Nijkamp for helpful comments. In {{this paper}} we study the {{relation}} between the distribution of income and the distribution of a given housing stock over under various <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In order to study a pure situation the population consists of households which differ only in income. We analyze the effects of various government measures intended to change {{the relation between}} these distributions. We first study a system in which prices are the only allocation instrument and switch later on to more complicated <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in which part of the costs associated with housing are financed by tax payments and a rent subsidy is introduced. Finally we consider a system of income prices. The positive relationship between income and housing quality can only be altered when the rents are dependent on income because of a rent subsidy or income prices. However, even under such <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> the positive relationship holds when housing is a luxury good. In order to judge the effects of the various <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> we employ the theory of fairness as developed by Kolm, Varian and others. It is shown that the distribution of the housing stock under uniform prices, i. e. prices which are independent of income, {{is the only one that}} can be considered as incrementally fair. Allocation systems which use prices that are dependent on income do not have this property. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} the communicational and computational barriers in allocation problems of indivisible items, we propose a novel and general class of allocation problems called categorized domain allocation problems (CDAPs), where the indivisible items are partitioned into multiple categories {{and we must}} allocate the items to the agents without monetary transfer, such that each agent gets at least one item from each category. We focus on the design and analysis of <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for basic CDAPs, where {{the number of items}} in each category is exactly the same as the number of agents. We start with serial dictatorships and characterize them by a minimal set of three properties: strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, and category-wise neutrality. Then, we design and analyze a natural extension of serial dictatorships called categorical sequential <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which allocate the items in multiple rounds so that in each round, the active agent chooses an item from the designated category.
