5|$|The Regent of Madiun, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika, {{participated in}} funding the {{construction}} of Taman Sari. Prawirasentika also beseeched the Sultan to be relieved of Madiun's tax obligation. He offered other <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> payment. The Sultan accepted his proposal. In 1758, the Sultan commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various complements, which {{would be used to}} build a beautiful garden. The sultan wanted a place where he could spend some time to relax after many years of wars that he had just experienced. Raden Tumenggung Mangundipura, under supervision of Raden Arya Natakusuma (who later became Sri Pakualam II), was responsible for the construction. The building was started in 1684 Javanese year (1758 AD). After finding out how large the complex was, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes. He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince Natakusuma who continued the project to completion.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{prior to}} 1840 the postal system was expensive, {{confusing}} and seen as corrupt. Letters were {{paid for by}} the recipient rather than the sender, and were charged according to the distance the letter had travelled and the number of sheets of paper it contained. Sir Rowland Hill reformed the postal system based on the concepts of penny postage and pre payment. In his proposal Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> getting the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{issued its}} {{decision}} on June 29, 1984 {{and in a}} 7-2 majority {{vote in favor of}} the National Park Service, it held that the regulations did not violate the First Amendment. The Court stressed that expression is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, also that the means of the protest went against the government's interest in maintaining the condition of the national parks. The Court felt that the protest was not being threatened altogether and that it could take place in a park where sleeping was permitted. In essence because the demonstrators could find <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> voicing their message their First Amendment right was safe. The regulation in question is also considered to be content neutral meaning the regulation did not have a bias against a particular message.|$|E
25|$|Abstract art uses {{a visual}} {{language}} of shape, form, color and line {{to create a}} composition which may exist {{with a degree of}} independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up {{to the middle of the}} 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.|$|E

500|$|When {{it became}} clear the {{original}} 1944 'Design A' was not technologically feasible, it was abandoned in favour of a simpler modification of the 1942 plans for the Lion class. This was subsequently christened 'Design B'. The 'B' proposal scaled back heavily on underwater protection, top speed and reduced {{the size of the}} citadel to the minimum possible while dramatically increasing freeboard and retaining much of design A's armour and firepower. Two further design series; 'C' and 'D', considered <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> saving weight via reduced armament or belt thickness, but these were quickly deemed unsatisfactory. 'Design B' became the primary focus and seven proposed versions were produced between March 1944 and February 1945, of which B3 became DNC's preference.|$|E
500|$|During its lifetime, Rise of Mana entered {{multiple}} collaborations {{with other}} games both for mobiles and other platforms: these included Final Fantasy Agito, Bravely Default, , Final Fantasy Adventure and Diffusion Million Arthur.

In the release, Square Enix said that a developing imbalance between content quality and revenue, in addition to problems with future content creation, had convinced them that Rise of Mana was no longer a profitable concern. Despite it ending service as a free-to-play title, the company is looking into <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> distributing the title.

500|$|Much of the album's {{sound was}} {{conceived}} by John Cale, who stressed the experimental {{qualities of the}} band. Cale, who was influenced greatly by his work with La Monte Young, John Cage and the early Fluxus movement, encouraged the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> producing sound in music. Cale thought his sensibilities meshed well with Lou Reed's, who was already experimenting with alternative tunings. For instance, Reed had [...] "invented" [...] the ostrich guitar tuning for a song he wrote called [...] "The Ostrich" [...] for the short-lived band the Primitives. Ostrich guitar tuning consists of all strings being tuned to the same note. The method was utilized on songs [...] "Venus in Furs" [...] and [...] "All Tomorrow's Parties". Often, the guitars were also tuned down a whole step, which produced a lower, fuller sound that Cale considered [...] "sexy".|$|E
