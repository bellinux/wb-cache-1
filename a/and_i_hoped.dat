5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
2500|$|Pauling {{attributes}} {{his interest}} in becoming a chemist to being amazed by experiments conducted by a friend, Lloyd A. Jeffress, who had a small chemistry lab kit. He later wrote: [...] "I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> to learn {{more and more about}} this aspect of the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 22, {{after an}} {{involvement}} with Tommy Mottola and Epic Records {{following the end of}} his first deal with Interscope, Thicke resolved himself to work chiefly on material for his debut album, initially titled Cherry Blue Skies, planning to use his own money to fund the project. As Thicke told Billboard, [...] "I decided I was going to save money to make my album, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> to offer it to labels–take it or leave it–so I didn't have to negotiate how to make my music." [...] While piecing his album together, Thicke began working with veteran producer and label executive Andre Harrell and, under his guidance, eventually signed [...] with Interscope for a second time as part of Harrell's and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds' Nu America imprint label in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first volume}} of History, subtitled [...] "from the {{earliest}} times to the Age of Macquarie" [...] appeared in 1962, and five more volumes, taking the story down to 1935, appeared over the next 26 years. In his autobiographical memoir A Historian's Apprenticeship published after his death, Clark recalled that his models were Carlyle, Edward Gibbon and T. B. Macaulay – two conservatives and a Whig – {{and that he was}} inspired by the belief that [...] "the story of Australia was a bible of wisdom both for those now living <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped,</b> for those to come after us". By this time he had rejected all the notions of progressive or Marxist historiography: [...] "I was beginning to see Australian history and indeed all history as a tragedy. Failure was the fate of the individual: success could be the fate of society. If that was a contradiction, I could only reply that it was but one of the many contradictions we must accept {{as soon as we can}} as part of the human condition".|$|E
2500|$|Blomfield, on {{the other}} hand, took a {{different}} approach to the cross. [...] He rejected Kenyon's design, arguing that [...] "runic monuments or gothic crosses {{had nothing to do with}} the grim terrors of the trenches." [...] Blomfield wanted a design that reflected the war, which had stripped away any notions about glory in combat and nobility in death on the battlefield. [...] "What I wanted to do in designing this Cross was to make it as abstract and impersonal as I could, to free it from any association of any particular style, and, above all, to keep clear of any sentimentalism of the Gothic. This was a man's war far too terrible for any fripperies, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> to get within range of the infinite in this symbol..." [...] His design featured an elongated cross of abstract design, on the front of which was a bronze longsword, blade pointed downward. It was intended to be an overtly Christian symbol, in contrast to Lutyen's Stone of Remembrance (which was purposefully stripped of any such associations). Blomfield drew the inspiration for the sword from a sword which hung in his home in Rye.|$|E
