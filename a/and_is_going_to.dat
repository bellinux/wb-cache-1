5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} characters, {{and three of}} them {{basically}} {{changed the course of}} British history. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. So I have an enormous responsibility to that, and then I have a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.|$|E
500|$|A bright blues [...] "stomper" [...] about lovers parting, [...] "Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine" [...] {{is one of}} {{the more}} literal songs Dylan {{recorded}} in his 1965–66 period. The narrator has tired of carrying his lover <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let her [...] "pass". As in [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] and [...] "Absolutely Sweet Marie", he waits until the end of each verse to deliver the punch line, which in this case comes from the title. [...] "Most Likely You Go Your Way" [...] was issued as a single a year later, in March 1967, on the B-side of [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat".|$|E

500|$|Fraser McAlpine of the BBC was {{positive}} {{in his review}} of the song. McAlpine felt that [...] "Dinosaur" [...] was the album's best track, {{and went on to}} note that its conception was enough to [...] "drive rock-bores into a state of spluttering fury." [...] McAlpine's consensus on the song was that [...] "it is made of nothing but sugar and sass and additives, a song from a young girl to an older man who is attempting to pick her up in a club. All she has to offer him is a scattergun spray of insults, and cutie-pie whistling. It’s childish and Parental Advisory Required at the same time, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> infuriate any adult within hearing range." ...|$|E
500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought it was funny as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That {{was a lot of fun}} for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|A rare {{example of}} a {{homosexual}} character not being portrayed in the standard effeminate way, albeit still negatively, was the villain [...] "Murder Legendre", played by Bela Lugosi in White Zombie (1932), the Frenchman who mastered the magical powers of a Bokor (voodoo sorcerer). Legendre is hired by a wealthy plantation owner Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer) to turn the woman he desires into a zombie, only to be informed later that Legendre desires him <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> transform him into a zombie. In films like Ladies They Talk About, lesbians were portrayed as rough, burly characters, but in DeMille's The Sign of the Cross, a female Christian slave is brought to a Roman prefect and seduced in dance by a statuesque lesbian dancer. Fox nearly became the first American studio {{to use the word}} [...] "gay" [...] to refer to homosexuality, but the SRC made the studio muffle the word in the soundtrack of all footage that reached theaters.|$|E

500|$|Marital {{infidelity}} features {{throughout the}} sections of the novel narrated by Sarah. Cleave discussed: [...] "When you are choosing a lover, you're choosing a philosophy; it's not about sex, it's not about marriage. With Sarah, her unfaithfulness {{is just one of}} the symptoms of the fact that she's torn <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to make this strong moral choice." [...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders we draw, and the real damage they inflict".|$|E
500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be {{one hell of a}} player. I was delighted to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E

500|$|Despite being a {{critical}} success throughout its run, criticisms {{began to emerge}} of the series in its third season. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as [...] "disappointing", mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: [...] "most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change, robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an [...] "increasingly extraneous character." [...] Goldman felt that despite the concerns over final five episodes, the series ended with [...] "three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can be, and what a strong character she is." [...] Goldman concluded that although the third season [...] "was very choppy", it still had [...] "plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive [...] "creatively", from [...] "the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines." [...] The reviewer felt that [...] "the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling {{as time went on}} and were too drawn out." [...] Fox News Channel's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had [...] "gone from punky to—dare we say—preppy" [...] in the third season. Byrne further explained that [...] "with her quick, bright wit and sharp eye for life's darker moments [...] has left high school <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> college, doffing her dark threads and spiked tresses for something a little more stylish." ...|$|E

April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting {{telling the story of}} her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an abusive one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year-old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo.
