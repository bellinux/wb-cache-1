40|$|The {{failure of}} guide banks because of scour at {{stratified}} bed conditions {{leads to the}} flow redistribution and an unpredicted scour at the alignment of the bridge crossing; as a result, this can be the reason for failure of piers and/or abutments. In spite of the importance {{and complexity of the}} phenomena, the equilibrium stage of scour at the elliptical guide banks under stratified bed has not been studied yet. Based on the condition that at an equilibrium stage of scour is when the local velocity becomes equal to the critical one, formulas for calculating the equilibrium depth of scour at the head of elliptical guide banks at uniform sand and stratified bed is elaborated. The most critical conditions for structures is when fine-sand layer is under coarse-sand layer. When the coarse layer is scoured away, the depth of scour is rapidly developing in the next fine-sand layer. In this case, the dominant grain size for calculating the depth of scour under stratified bed conditions is the mean diameter of the second layer or of the next one, where the scour stops. According to the analysis results the depth of scour is always greater when a fine-sand layer is under coarse-sand layer(s.) The calculation of scour depth near hydraulic structures in flow by using the grain size {{on the top of the}} river bed and neglecting the stratification can lead to wrong results and finally to considerable damages and losses.

In the present work, new flow modelling strategies have been developed for flow simulation in the inlet header of side entry shell and tube heat exchangers used in alumina plants and minerals processing plants for heat recovery. The traditional approach of treating the tube bundle as a porous plug observing Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s friction law has been replaced by modelling of all tubes individually and application of an inertial model for flow resistance. This better reflects the much higher velocities for the approach into the tube bundle as only about one third of the tube sheet is open area. It also includes the effect of flow separation within the inlet to some tubes which is a flow feature not able to be simulated with the porous plug approach. The traditional use of symmetry for the inlet geometry has been found to suppress the inherent asymmetry found in this flow associated with the large flow expansion from the inlet nozzle to the inlet header space. The results indicate that tube inlet wear is spread across the tube sheet more extensively than indicated by porous plug modelling. The asymmetry of flow uncovered by the new modelling technique leads to less regular wear patterns which may help to explain the difficulty of recognizing clear cut patterns of wear in processing plants. Areas of high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> into tubes, variations of mass flow distributions across tube sheets and a flow component across the geometrical symmetry plane are identified.
