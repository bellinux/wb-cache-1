40|$|Right {{estimating}} of {{the coefficient}} of friction between the wheel and rail is essential in modelling rail vehicle dynamics. Constant value of coefficient of friction is the typical assumption in theoretical studies.

Four <b>axle</b> <b>rail</b> vehicle model were built. The FASTSIM code is employed for calculation of the tangential contact forces between wheel and rail.

40|$|This work {{presents}} initial {{results from}} {{a new approach to}} condition monitoring of <b>rail</b> <b>axle</b> bearings, in particular some early-stage failures. Background: premature failure of <b>rail</b> <b>axle</b> bearings causes a significant increase in train operating costs and can impact on train safety. <b>Rail</b> <b>axle</b> bearings have an anticipated service life; however, some bearings do not achieve this. A new approach to degradation diagnostics is now in use on Southeastern / Bombardier trains and provides real-time vibration condition monitoring. Each independent wireless sensor unit bolts to a wheel bearing housing. The units are self-powered by vibration harvesting. This emerging methodology has been made possible by the decreasing power budget of sensor and wireless technologies. Methods: in this initial study, real ex-situ examples of failures of bearings have been examined. The damaged regions of the bearings are examined using a suite of non-destructive techniques including optical and scanning electron microscopy, computed tomography (CT) and surface profilometry as well as traditional metallographic sectioning methods. Discussion: a new on-board condition monitoring system has made possible the examination of the onset of in-service bearing degradation, allowing identification well in advance of catastrophic destruction of the evidence. Initial results indicate that the vibration sensors are correctly identifying failing bearings. CT damage maps are allowing targeted metallographic sectioning of the samples. Correlation between vibration data and the bearing damage parameters will improve diagnostic accuracy and ultimately improve train safety<br/...|$|R
40|$|Railway axles {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components in rail industry since their failure can lead to the derailment of railway vehicles and loss of lives and properties. These components suffer from a wide range of damage including corrosion, electrical arcing, and fatigue and most importantly wear due to excessive loading. Every year rail operators around the world scrap thousands of railway axles due to the size of their two bearing journals being under tolerances and sizes defined for them. The current standards for manufacturing and maintenance of <b>rail</b> <b>axles</b> only allow for non-thermal processes such as brush plating to be used to repair the worn <b>rail</b> <b>axles</b> as thermal processes as they may create heat affected zones with degraded properties in these components. In this study the possibility of using laser cladding which is a thermal process as a repair technology for refurbishment of railway axles is investigated which was proposed for the first time in 2010 by Hardchrome Engineering Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia. The economic rationale behind this idea was that replacing each worn axle would cost 2500 Australian dollars whereas repairing them with laser cladding would cost only 1000 Australian dollars per axle, provided that the feasibility of this technology and suitability for railway axle applications is proven. Mild steel which is one of the most widely used materials in the manufacturing of <b>rail</b> <b>axles</b> was used to prepare hour glass fatigue samples to be tested under rotary bending fatigue condition using a dedicated testing machine which was designed and used at Hardchrome Engineering. These samples were tested without any laser deposition to demonstrate the fatigue data of axles which were not worn. To simulate worn railway axles, a groove was machined in each fatigue sample which was later filled by laser cladding as a simulation of a refurbished <b>rail</b> <b>axle.</b> Two different cladding materials were used to build up undersize machined samples which were 420 stainless steel and CrMoV. The laser clad samples were then heat treated at a wide range of temperatures to investigate the effect of post-clad heat treatment conditions on the fatigue properties of laser clad samples. The fatigue results of the clad samples were compared to those of the non-clad samples to investigate the effect of laser cladding on the fatigue properties of the samples...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method for producing stepped <b>rail</b> <b>axles.</b> The method {{is based on}} the skew rolling process. With this method, the product is formed by three tapered rolls located every 120 ° on the perimeter of the billet.

At the same time, they get closer together or go apart depending on the desired cross sectional reduction of an axle step. In addition, the workpiece is shifted lengthwise relative to the rolls by the translational motion of the workpiece-holding chuck. In order to verify the designed method for producing <b>rail</b> <b>axles,</b> a series of numerical simulations were performed using the Simufact. Forming v. 12 simulation software.

According to the high-speed axle technical standard for the control of alloy elements in axle steel, optimization experiments of 25 CrMo steel composition were performed by vacuum inductive melting. In order to study the hardenability of high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>axles,</b> an improved end-quench test was put forward.

The hardenability of 25 CrMo axle steels with Mn content of 0. 60 wt. % and 0. 80 wt. % was investigated mainly by means of optical microscopy and hardness tests. The experimental results indicate that the Mn has a pronounced effect on the hardenability of the steel.

In the first place, these inappropriate events lead to the reduction of service life of the railway track. Besides, studying railway systems requires both time-consuming analysis methods and expensive experimental works.

40|$|Under sleeper pads (USPs) are the {{component}} installed under the concrete sleepers generally to improve railway track resilience. Initial development in Europe, particularly in Austria, has encouraged {{the adoption of}} {{the component}} around the world. In practice, the component has commonly been used in certain applications, mainly to moderate track stiffness in special locations such as turnouts, crossings, and level crossing. In heavy haul operation, the heavier wagons result in sturdier bogie structures, higher unsprung mass, and then higher level of wheel-rail interaction forces. Accordingly, the application of USPs to mitigate detrimental impact load consequence on track structure is presented in this paper.

The bearings examined in this work {{have been removed from}} service, following the identification of degradation using on-board condition monitoring techniques. The running surfaces of the bearings were examined and the damage fully characterized using a mixture of metallographic, surface profilometry and high-resolution micro-Computed Tomography (μ-CT) techniques. In this manner the RCF was categorised by initiation mechanism: sub-surface or surface. This work has led to an increased understanding of the propagation of sub-surface and surface initiated RCF and its implications for life and condition of the bearing once failure has initiated. It was determined that the sub-surface initiated RCF damage was the first to occur in service and produced large craters on the bearing running surface. Once material had been lost in this primary manner, further secondary surface-initiating RCF grew from the edges of the large craters. It was deemed that the deep primary sub-surface RCF craters were more life limiting than the secondary surface damage. Therefore maps of the damage were created allowing the two mechanisms to be examined separately, both visually and by quantitative parameters such as volume loss, area, depth, roughness etc...|$|R
40|$|A major {{environmental}} concern related to railway traffic is vibration. A lot of re- search {{has been carried}} out to understand vibration of straight tracks, with less attention been paid to curved tracks. Modelling the dynamic behaviour of a curved railway track is important to understand the physics of generation and propagation of vibration fromtrains at non-straight sections of tracks. Modelling is also important to assess the current and any alternative track designs from an environmental point of view. In this paper a curved track is modelled and the effect of curvature is investigated. Two models have been developed and their results have been compared. In the first, the curved track is modelled using straight beam elements. In the second curved beam elements are used. For both, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory has been adopted to describe their bending behaviour. The elements have 12 degrees of freedom accounting for displacements and rotations in the lateral, transverse and longitudinal directions. The excitation comes from an <b>axle</b> traversing the <b>rails</b> with subcritical velocity, accounting for the wheel-rail contact forces. The describedmodels are solved using the Finite Element Method. The time domain response of the versine of the curved track due to the passage of the axle is computed. A comparison is made on the efficiency of the two models for different curve radii and frequencies. The two models provide very similar results showing that the piecewise straight beam approximation represents the behaviour of the curved track accurately. Also the curved beam model used in this study shows some limitations for the specific application and therefore the straight element method is recommende...|$|R
40|$|The Iron Ore Line (IOL) is a 473 km long {{track section}} {{which is located}} in {{northern}} Sweden and northern Norway, {{and has been in}} operation since 1903. The northern part is located above the Arctic Circle. The IOL is mainly used to transport iron ore and pellets from the mines in Kiruna and Malmberget to Narvik Harbour (Norway) in the northwest and Luleå Harbour (Sweden) in the southeast. The track section on the Swedish side is owned by the Swedish Government and managed by Trafikverket (the Swedish Transport Administration), while the ore wagons are owned and managed by the freight operator (LKAB). The IOL has seen a considerable increase in the axle load and traffic volume recently. Due to the introduction of new vehicles with a 30 -ton <b>axle</b> load, the <b>rails</b> were gradually replaced between 2006 and 2009 with heavier rails, generally with a steel grade of 350 LHT. The rail and wheels suffer from rolling contact fatigue (RCF) due to high friction between the rail and wheel. To control the wheel-rail interface, wayside top-of-rail (TOR) lubrication can be used. The reliability of the TOR lubrication equipment and the lubricants in northern conditions has not been investigated, and the long-term maintenance support required for TOR lubrication is unknown to the infrastructure manager. Furthermore, can TOR lubrication reduce the rail and wheel maintenance costs? This project has been conducted through collaboration between the main operator (LKAB) and the infrastructure manager (Trafikverket); the costs have been shared and the results analysed in collaboration. This paper describes the test period of two years, using two different TOR lubrication systems in two different places on the IOL, one situated in the northern loop and one in the southern loop, each with different operational conditions. The paper shows the actual operational conditions for the pilot test locations, the friction value close to the systems, the rail forces during the test period and some results for the noise measurements.

The second step is project and construction of special narrow-track experimental rail car, that would be used for experiments and verification of the algorithms. The last step should be implementation of developed algorithms to control systems of real tram.

To prevent problems with the capacity along Malmbanan (The Iron Ore Line) {{an increase in the}} maximum permissible axle load is required. The first step is an increase from 30 ton to 32. 5 ton. The vision is {{to increase the}} axle load in 4 steps of 32. 5 - 35 - 37. 5 – 40 ton, where an axle load of 40 ton is the final goal. The report deals with the influence of an increased axle load for each track component. This is in order to present the deterioration of the track quality when the axle load is increased. Different methods of track maintenance and reinforcements will also be discussed. The work is focused on the southern circuit of Malmbanan. Track conditions on individual track sections will not be considered. The work only includes the track structure i. e. signaling systems and power supply systems will not be considered. Economical calculations of reinforcement and maintenance activities is left for future investigations. The working process has included a literature study, field study, computational study and an interview study. This has led to an assessment of to what extent each track component is affected by an increase in maximum permissible <b>axle</b> load. The <b>rail</b> will be exposed to a higher amount of wear, an increased risk for rail defects and plastic deformation of the rail head. Rail damage is most easily prevented by rail grinding and rail lubrication in sharp curves. More extensive measures are to replace the rail with a stronger rail steel or replace with a larger rail profile. The rail fastenings will be affected by higher track forces and are particularly exposed in sharp curves. The rail fastening systems has to be replaced gradually when increasing the permissible axle load. The only fastening device, in use today, that will be approved for 40 ton axle load is the Fastclip and the strongest e-clips with plastic rail pads. The lifetime of the sleepers will be shortened with an increased axle load. A critical factor is the bending moment at the position of the rail {{and in the middle of}} the sleeper. According to the performed calculations all sleeper models eventually have to be replaced, except sleeper model A 22. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sleeper strength for some models. Strength tests for each specific sleeper model should therefore be carried out. It is recommended that a research study is performed to gain knowledge about the track position and model for all the fastening systems and sleepers along the track. This in order to ease future track upgrades. A higher axle load leads to an accelerated deterioration of the ballast. Ballast cleaning is recommended in the near future to reduce the rate of ballast contamination. The ballast thickness should not be less than 50 cm, according to performed calculations. An increased axle load will cause an increased need for maintenance of the track substructure. Reinforcements have to be carried out on several bridges and culverts. This also applies to the geotechnics, which is mainly reinforced by pressure banks at track sections with poor subgrade. A complete investigation of the bearing capacity of the track subgrade should be performed. This in order to find track sections with insufficient bearing capacity. An investigation of the load carrying capacity for all bridges along the southern circuit of Malmbanan should also be performed...|$|R
