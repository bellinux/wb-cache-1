50|$|The WCSB is {{considered}} a mature <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration</b> of petroleum and recent development has tended toward natural gas and oil sands rather than conventional oil. In the WCSB, conventional oil is of two different types: light crude oil and heavy crude oil, each with different costs, prices, and development strategies. Conventional light oil is a mature industry {{with most of the}} recoverable oil reserves already produced and production declining by three to four percent per year. Conventional heavy oil is also past its production peak with a future of long-term decline. Alberta, which contains most of the reserves, expects its light-medium crude oil production to decline by 42% from 2006 to 2016, while it expects heavy crude production to decrease by 35% over the same period. However, it also expects bitumen and synthetic crude oil from oil sands will considerably more than offset the decline in conventional crude oil and account for 87% of Alberta oil production by 2016.|$|E

The problem presents a complex <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration,</b> since it encompasses face acquisition, facial feature tracking, facial expression classification. Facial feature tracking is of the most interest. Active Appearance Model (AAM) enables accurate tracking of facial features in real-time, but lacks occlusions and self-occlusions. In this {{paper we propose a}} solution to improve the accuracy of fitting technique. The idea is to include occluded images into AAM training data.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{virulence}} {{has been}} associated with the production of phenol soluble modulins (PSM). PSM are known to activate, attract and lyse neutrophils. However, the functional characterizations were generally performed in the absence of human serum. Here, we demonstrate that human serum can inhibit all the previously-described activities of PSM. We observed that serum can fully block both the cell lysis and FPR 2 activation of neutrophils. We show a direct interaction between PSM and serum lipoproteins in human serum and whole blood. Subsequent analysis using purified high, low, and very low density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and VLDL) revealed that they indeed neutralize PSM. The lipoprotein HDL showed highest binding and antagonizing capacity for PSM. Furthermore, we show potential intracellular production of PSM by S. aureus upon phagocytosis by neutrophils, which opens a new <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration</b> of the intracellular lytic capacity of PSM. Collectively, our data show that in a serum environment the function of PSM as important extracellular toxins should be reconsidered...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to bacteria, all archaea possess cell walls lacking peptidoglycan {{and a number}} of different cell envelope components have also been described. A paracrystalline protein surface layer, commonly referred to as S-layer, is present in nearly all archaea described to date. S-layers are composed of only one or two proteins and form different lattice structures. In this review, we summarize current understanding of archaeal S-layer proteins, discussing topics such as structure, lattice type distribution among archaeal phyla and glycosylation. The hexagonal lattice type is dominant within the phylum Euryarchaeota, while in the Crenarchaeota this feature is mainly associated with specific orders. S-layers exclusive to the Crenarchaeota have also been described, which are composed of two proteins. Information regarding S-layers in the remaining archaeal phyla is limited, mainly due to organism description through only culture-independent methods. Despite the numerous applied studies using bacterial S-layers, few reports have employed archaea as a study model. As such, archaeal S-layers represent an <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration</b> in both basic and applied research...|$|E

40|$|To {{explore what}} it means to achieve social justice in health is to try and explore two of the most contested and complex {{concepts}} that we have, and to work through to conclusions that are in common with them both. This is a considerable challenge. To try and address it, what follows will take the following strategy. First, we will consider what makes health a distinctive <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration</b> in its own right. In ontological terms, what can we say about health that marks it as a distinctive field? By trying to answer this question, we can then create a starting point for coming up with a range of factors that exploring social justice in terms of health will have to address. Next, having established our distinctive health factors, we can attempt to consider what each, and their combination, means in terms of social justice. This clearly means finding an appropriate theory of social justice that can address them. Once we have found such a theory, we can then attempt to combine the two to come to some conclusions.

Such a condition makes the East Java region an important <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration</b> of the subsurface seismic wave velocity structure, especially in its upper crust. We employed the ambient noise tomography method to image the upper crustal structure under this study area. We used seismic data recorded at 24 seismographs of BMKG spread over East Java and Bali. In addition, we installed 28 portable seismographs in East Java from April 2013 to January 2014 for 2 – 8  weeks, and we installed an additional 28 seismographs simultaneously throughout East Java from August 2015 to April 2016. We constructed inter-station Rayleigh wave Green’s functions through cross-correlations of the vertical component of seismic noise recordings at 1500 pairs of stations. We used the Neighborhood Algorithm to construct depth profiles of {{shear wave velocity}} (Vs). The main result obtained from {{this study is the}} thickness of sediment cover. East Java’s southern mountain zone is dominated by higher Vs, the Kendeng basin in the center is dominated by very low Vs, and the Rembang zone (to the North of Kendeng zone) is associated with medium Vs. The existence of structures with oil and gas potential in the Kendeng and Rembang zones can be identified by low Vs.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{patients with}} contamination-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) {{are characterized by}} sympathetic magic beliefs (i. e., an irrational understanding of how contagion is transmitted). We asked OCD patients (OCs), non-anxious control participants (NACs), and anxious control participants (ACs) to identify a "contaminated" object and rate its degree of contamination on a 0 - 100 scale. Next, we touched a clean pencil to the object, and participants rated {{the degree to which}} the pencil was contaminated. A second pencil was touched to the first pencil and was then rated. This process was continued for 12 pencils (12 degrees of removal from the original object). The same process was repeated using threat-non-relevant stimuli. Results indicated that for threat-relevant stimuli, OCs seemed to perceive a "chain of contagion" in which successive degrees of removal from the original object were not rated as less contaminated. In contrast, NACs and ACs quickly identified the pencils as not contaminated, suggesting that they recognize the contamination as degrading across objects. This difference was not seen using threat-nonrelevant stimuli. We also found that ratings of looming vulnerability (a belief that the contamination is spreading, approaching, or escalating in threat value) mediated the relationship between diagnostic group and the chain of contagion. We suggest that this process may be consistent with the sympathetic magic and disease-avoidance models of disgust, and that disgust may be a fruitful <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploration</b> in the study of OCD...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcquisition of phototrophy {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the eukaryotic tree of life and can involve algal endosymbiosis or plastid retention from green or red origins. Species with acquired phototrophy are important components of diversity in aquatic ecosystems, but there are major differences in host and algal taxa involved and in niches of protists with acquired phototrophy in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Organisms that carry out acquired phototrophy are usually mixotrophs, but {{the degree to which}} they depend on phototrophy is variable. Evidence suggests that `excess carbon' provided by acquired phototrophy has been important in supporting major evolutionary innovations that are crucial to the current ecological roles of these protists in aquatic ecosystems. Acquired phototrophy occurs primarily among radiolaria, foraminifera, ciliates and dinoflagellates, but is most ecologically important among the first three. Acquired phototrophy in foraminifera and radiolaria is crucial to their contributions to carbonate, silicate, strontium, and carbon flux in subtropical and tropical oceans. Planktonic ciliates with algal kleptoplastids are important in marine and fresh waters, whereas ciliates with green algal endosymbionts are mostly important in freshwaters. The phototrophic ciliate Myrionecta rubra can be a major primary producer in coastal ecosystems. Our knowledge of how acquired phototrophy influences trophic dynamics and biogeochemical cycles is rudimentary; we need to go beyond traditional concepts of `plant' and `animal' functions to progress in our understanding of aquatic microbial ecology.
