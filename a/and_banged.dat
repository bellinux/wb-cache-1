5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, <b>and</b> <b>banged</b> the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E

When the audience arrived they would sell sweets {{to the children}} as a fee for the show, which was their main source of income. They would then unfold a butai, a miniature wooden proscenium which held the illustrated boards for the narrator to change as he narrated (and provided sound effects for) the unscripted story. True artists only used hand-painted original art, not the mass-produced kind found in schools or for other communication purposes.|$|E
25|$|During lulls in the shelling, Hemingway {{repeatedly}} told Walton {{how much}} he hated his mother. Hemingway loathed her because she had accepted money from him, even while she condemned the books he wrote on moral grounds. Hemingway later saved Walton's life during the battle. Hemingway recognized {{the sound of an}} oncoming German plane, and threw Walton out of the jeep they were riding in just moments before it was strafed. The two men parted, but met again on New Year's Eve in London. Walton told Hemingway {{that he was going to}} have dinner with Hemingway's wife, Martha Gellhorn. Hemingway and Gellhorn were on the verge of divorce after several rocky years of marriage. Hemingway invited himself to the dinner. Hemingway ridiculed and taunted his wife all night, and Walton stood up for her. In the early hours of the next morning, Hemingway stripped to his underwear, put a bucket on his head, <b>and</b> <b>banged</b> on Gellhorn's door with a mop, demanding to be let in. Walton moved into the Hôtel Ritz in Paris in January 1945, covering the war from the liberated city. Hemingway, now openly dating Mary Welsh even though his divorce was not yet final, was in one of the happiest moods of his life. He bragged openly to Walton about his powerful sex life and happiness.|$|E

500|$|At {{one point}} in December, Thơ could no longer {{withstand}} what the free media were publishing about him and called around 100 journalists into his office. An angry Thơ shouted at the writers <b>and</b> <b>banged</b> his first on the table, assailing them for what he regarded as inaccurate, irresponsible and disloyal reporting. Thơ claimed the media were lying in saying {{that he and his}} civilian cabinet were puppets of the generals, and claimed that one of the journalists was a communist while another was a drug addict. He said that his administration would [...] "take steps to meet the situation" [...] if the media did not behave responsibly. Having already had his Information Minister, General Đỗ Mậu, circulate a list of topics that were not to be reported on, Thơ had Mậu close down three newspapers for [...] "disloyalty" [...] on the following day.|$|E
500|$|On December 5, Chiang Kai-shek paid a {{visit to}} a {{defensive}} encampment near Jurong to heckle his men to keep up the fight, but he was forced to beat a hasty retreat when the Japanese Army burst onto the battlefield guns blazing. On that day the rapidly moving forward contingents of the SEA occupied Jurong and then arrived at Chunhuazhen, a key point of Nanking's outer line of defense which would put Japanese artillery in range of the city. Here China's 51st Division flung its main force into the fighting and repeatedly repulsed Japanese attacks before cracking on December 8 when the main force of the SEA arrived. The SEA also took the fortress at Zhenjiang and the spa town of Tangshuizhen on that day. Meanwhile, {{on the south side of}} the same defense line, armored vehicles of Japan's 10th Army charged the Chinese position at Jiangjunshan and Niushoushan defended by China's 58th Division. Valiant Chinese soldiers armed with hammers jumped onto the vehicles <b>and</b> <b>banged</b> repeatedly on their roofs shouting [...] "Get out of there!", but after darkness fell on the battlefield the 58th Division was finally overwhelmed on December 9 after suffering, according to its own records, 800 casualties.|$|E

Later, about 200 loyalists blocked Albertbridge Road and Castlereagh Street, while a line of riot police separated them from a crowd that had gathered at Short Strand.

2500|$|In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher {{was elected}} {{leader of the}} British Conservative Party. The Institute of Economic Affairs {{arranged}} a meeting between Hayek and Thatcher in London soon after. During Thatcher's only visit to the Conservative Research Department {{in the summer of}} 1975, a speaker had prepared a paper on why the [...] "middle way" [...] was the pragmatic path the Conservative Party should take, avoiding the extremes of left and right. Before he had finished, Thatcher [...] "reached into her briefcase and took out a book. It was Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty.

2500|$|When {{apparently}} the last eminent guest {{had long ago}} taken his place, again those three bugle-blasts rang out, and once more the swords leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table—'MOMMSEN!'—and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped <b>and</b> <b>banged</b> the beer mugs. Just simply a storm! ...|$|E
2500|$|Diaghilev {{was known}} as a hard, demanding, even {{frightening}} taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too afraid to ever look him in the face. George Balanchine said he carried around a cane during rehearsals, <b>and</b> <b>banged</b> it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914–18 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballet Russes and would later say that she had called Diaghilev [...] "Sergypops" [...] and he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{work in the}} Bacchus mythos to be {{published}} by Dark Horse was also the first time Bacchus appeared within a comic published in colour, The Ghost In The Glass, published in 1995.

[...] The Bacchus character's stories came to an end after the Banged Up storyline, and although Campbell eventually finished the reprinting of the previously published material, he continued publishing Eddie Campbell's Bacchus, updating the name to Eddie Campbell's Bacchus Magazine to reflect the growing number of text pieces he was running, before cancelling the book with issue sixty.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{confirmed}} by surviving terrorist Jamal Al-Gashey who revealed that Ladany was spotted racing away from the building leading the terrorists {{to believe that they}} were too late to take any hostages in Apartment number two, though several were still inside the apartment.
