5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

500|$|The news of Washington's successes reached Paris at a {{critical}} time. [...] Britain's ambassador to France, Lord Stormont, was preparing complaints to France's foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, concerning the semi-secret financial and logistical support France had been giving to the rebels. [...] Stormont had learned that supplies bound for America were to be shipped under French flags, where they had previously sent under American colors. [...] He wrote that the French court was extremely happy with the news, and that the French diplomatic position noticeably hardened: [...] "that M. de Vergennes is hostile in his heart and anxious {{for the success of}} the Rebels I have not <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doubt." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{and after}} the {{publication}} of the score in 1922, scholars questioned the work's authenticity, and its attribution to Monteverdi continued to be in some doubt until the 1950s. The Italian musicologist Giacomo Benvenuti maintained, {{on the basis of a}} 1942 performance in Milan, that the work was simply not good enough to be by Monteverdi. Apart from the stylistic differences between Il ritorno and Monteverdi's other surviving late opera, L'incoronazione di Poppea, the main issue which raised doubts was the series of discrepancies between the score and the libretto. However, much of the uncertainty concerning the attribution was resolved through the discovery of contemporary documents, all confirming Monteverdi's role as the composer. These documents include a letter from the unknown librettist of Le nozze d'Enea in Lavinia, which discusses Monteverdi's setting of Il ritorno. There is also Badoaro's preface to the Il ritorno libretto, addressed to the composer, which includes the wording [...] "I can firmly state that my Ulysses is more indebted to you than ever was the real Ulysses to the ever-gracious Minerva". A 1644 letter from Badoaro to Michelangelo Torcigliani contains the statement [...] "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria was embellished with the music of Claudio Monteverdi, a man of great fame and enduring name". Finally, a 1640 booklet entitled Le Glorie della Musica indicates the Badoaro-Monteverdi pairing as the creators of the opera. In the view of conductor and instrumentalist Sergio Vartolo, these findings establish Monteverdi as the principal composer [...] "beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doubt". Although parts of the music may be by other hands, there is no doubt that the work is substantially Monteverdi's and remains close to his original conception.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} provide female {{students}} a permanent place at MIT, she would donate the money to found Stanley McCormick Hall, an all female dormitory that would allow MIT to house 200 female students. Katharine's funding made a tremendous impact {{of the number of}} women at MIT, increasing from 3% to 40%. The ramifications of the hall are best stated by William Hecht '61, {{executive vice president of the}} Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT when he said, [...] "the visible presence of women at MIT helped open up the science and engineering professions to a large part of the population that before had been excluded. It demonstrated beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doubt that at MIT men and women are equal." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 17, 2008, Natonski {{notified}} Peralta's {{family that}} he would receive the Navy Cross instead of the Medal of Honor. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates rejected the Marine Corps recommendation, saying that his panel unanimously confirmed that Peralta's actions {{did not meet the}} Medal of Honor standard [...] "without any possibility of error or doubt". Gates' central argument related to whether the already-mortally-wounded Peralta could have intentionally reached for the grenade, shielding his fellow Marines from the blast. During a Marine Corps investigation of the attack Natonski had said, [...] "I believe beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doubt" [...] that the gravely-wounded Peralta covered the grenade. Doubt arose when some believed that Peralta was clinically dead when the grenade was thrown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} {{diffraction}} are {{often seen in}} everyday life. The most striking examples of diffraction are those that involve light; for example, the closely spaced tracks on a CD or DVD act as a diffraction grating to form the familiar rainbow pattern seen when looking at a disc. This principle can be extended to engineer a grating with a structure such that it will produce any diffraction pattern desired; the hologram on a credit card is an example. Diffraction in the atmosphere by small particles can cause a bright ring to be visible around a bright light source [...] like the sun or the moon. <b>A</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid object, using light from a compact source, shows small fringes near its edges. The speckle pattern which is observed when laser light falls on an optically rough surface is also a diffraction phenomenon. [...] When deli meat appears to be iridescent, that is diffraction off the meat fibers. All these effects are {{a consequence of the}} fact that light propagates as a wave.|$|E
2500|$|Morley viewed imperialism and an interventionist {{foreign policy}} as {{increasing}} {{the power of}} the state. The increase in state expenditure due to the Boer War (1899–1902) disturbed him because it might lead to the state's revenue raising power being used to implement great changes in the social and economic structure of the country. Francis Hirst recorded in October 1899 about Morley: [...] "He is depressed about national expenditure. He fears, when bad times come, that we shall have not retrenchment, but [...] "nefarious attacks on property and reversions to Fair Trade"." [...] Imperialism and the increasing expenditure needed to fund it would lead to a reconstruction of the income tax and in turn would lead to taxing some people more heavily than others, some thing which was against the [...] "maxims of public equity". Morley now regretted Gladstone's budget of 1853 (where the income tax was set [...] "on its legs") because it gave the Chancellor of the Exchequer [...] "a reservoir out of which he could draw with ease and certainty whatever was asked for". Gladstone had [...] "furnished not only the means, but a direct incentive to that policy of expenditure which it was the great object of his life to check". After Joseph Chamberlain came out in favour of Tariff Reform in 1903, Morley defended Free Trade. Morley claimed that it was no coincidence that since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, Britain was the only great country in Western Europe not to experience [...] "even <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil convulsion". Protectionism was conducive to social distress, political corruption and political unrest.|$|E
