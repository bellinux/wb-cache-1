5|$|All whales have <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber. In {{species that}} {{live near the}} poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard}} time getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} aquatic {{life with a}} spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the cold, harsh {{environment}} of the Alps are apparent: distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind Napoleon and his troupe, while a steep cliff face appears on his left, and the path underfoot has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> ice.|$|E
50|$|The report {{recommended}} that Trilcor work with its supplier <b>of</b> laminating <b>layer</b> {{to resolve the}} problem, and indicated that <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> material would likely perform better.|$|R
5000|$|Puerto Fino, made around El Puerto de Santa María. The cooler climate {{near the}} sea results in <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> flor and <b>a</b> more acidic and {{delicate}} flavour than Jerez Fino.|$|R
5000|$|Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped {{up against}} the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{shielding}} before entering the house.|$|R
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|The {{geological}} {{study of}} Antarctica {{has been greatly}} hindered by {{nearly all of the}} continent being permanently covered with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> ice. However, new techniques such as remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several {{of which have been}} observed on the surface.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} is <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layering</b> <b>of</b> fine-grained, altered volcaniclastic sediments. Most of these sediments are ash-rich mudstone, siltstone, and very fine sandstone. There is also coarser sandstone, conglomerate, carbonates, and ash tuff.|$|R
50|$|Variations of {{the drink}} involve {{the use of}} cream instead of milk, and {{flavoring}} with cinnamon or chocolate powder. It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> micro foam.|$|R
50|$|Quaker Run has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layering</b> <b>of</b> iron {{precipitate}} {{along its}} length. The <b>layering</b> is more <b>thick</b> and solidly packed than {{in some other}} nearby streams. Historically, there was a quarry near the stream. Mine complexes also extend under the stream.|$|R
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
50|$|Hypercementosis is an idiopathic, non-neoplastic {{condition}} {{characterized by}} the excessive buildup of normal cementum (calcified tissue) on the roots {{of one or more}} teeth. <b>A</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> cementum can give the tooth an enlarged appearance, which mainly occurs at the apex or apices of the tooth.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, tires {{actually}} have more traction {{when they are}} bald, because there is more surface area making contact with the road. The reason regular tires have treads is to avoid hydroplaning when {{the surface of the}} road is wet. Stock cars driven on professionally maintained NASCAR tracks use tires without treads, and with <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> rubber.|$|R
500|$|A type of soil {{known as}} the Leck Kill soil occurs along Catawissa Creek. Usually, {{cultivated}} Leck Kill soils are topped with <b>an</b> [...] <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> dark brown silt loam, with a subsoil of reddish-brown silt loam that extends {{to a depth of}} [...] Below the subsoil is <b>a</b> [...] <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> clay loam. The bedrock below this type of soil is red shale.|$|R
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing {{much of it}} through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, coated with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting {{has been found}} and {{very little in the}} way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell {{is affected by the}} amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
50|$|The fascia of Camper is <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> {{superficial}} <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{the anterior}} abdominal wall.|$|R
50|$|Neornithischia ("new ornithischians") is a clade of {{the dinosaur}} order Ornithischia. They are the sister {{group of the}} Thyreophora within the clade Genasauria. Neornithischians are united by having <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{asymmetrical}} enamel {{on the inside of}} their lower teeth. The teeth wore unevenly with chewing and developed sharp ridges that allowed neornithischians to break down tougher plant food than other dinosaurs.|$|R
25|$|The acidic capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CPS) is <b>a</b> <b>thick,</b> mucous-like, <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> polysaccharide that surrounds some pathogen E. coli.|$|R
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter {{being among the}} most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream and covered with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fondant icing. The recipe today remains {{identical to the one}} employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to {{hundreds of miles from}} the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
50|$|In {{the recent}} past the common {{explanation}} was based on water absorption in the keratin-laden epithelial skin when immersed in water, causing the skin to expand and resulting in a larger surface area, forcing it to wrinkle. Usually {{the tips of the}} fingers and toes are the first to wrinkle because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> keratin and <b>an</b> absence of hairs which secrete the protective oil called sebum.|$|R
5000|$|Down (or any insulation) {{provides}} warmth by trapping a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{air that}} separates the cold side from the warm side. <b>A</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> trapped air gives more insulation. This thickness is often called [...] "loft." [...] A comforter that uses 550 fill power down, for example, would have to use approximately 40%-50% greater weight of down than a similar item that uses 800 fill power down to provide the same loft.|$|R
2500|$|Bats rely on skin {{on their}} wings to {{generate}} lift and thrust used in flight. Therefore, {{the structure of}} the bat wing skin is different from the skin of the bat body. Bat wing skin consists <b>of</b> two thin <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> epidermis with a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> dermis/hypodermis located between the epidermal layers whereas [...] the skin of the bat body consists <b>of</b> a single <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> epidermis with <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> dermis internal to the epidermis.|$|R
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. <b>A</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced {{by the presence of}} arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E
2500|$|A multicolored print {{could be}} made using {{different}} blocks for different colors. For ceramics, the print was made onto duplex paper, with a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> tissue paper facing <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> paper. <b>A</b> weak varnish was painted on the ceramic surface, which could be slightly curved, then the duplex paper pressed onto the surface. [...] The tissue paper was soaked off before firing. Later techniques were developed to photographically copy images onto lithograph plates.|$|R
