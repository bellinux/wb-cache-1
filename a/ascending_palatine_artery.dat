50|$|The <b>ascending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> is {{an artery}} {{in the head}} that {{branches}} off the facial artery and runs up the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|E
50|$|Branches are {{distributed}} to the gums, the palatine glands, and the mucous membrane of {{the roof of the}} mouth; while in the pterygopalatine canal it gives off twigs which descend in the lesser palatine canals to supply the soft palate and palatine tonsil, anastomosing with the <b>ascending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>ascending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> arises {{close to}} {{the origin of the}} facial artery and passes up between the {{styloglossus}} and stylopharyngeus {{to the side of the}} pharynx along which it is continued between the superior pharyngeal constrictor and the medial pterygoid muscle to near the base of the skull.|$|E
30|$|The {{tonsillectomy}} procedure {{itself is}} not technically demanding, but unexpected excessive hemorrhage is a constant risk due to a surplus of blood supply to the tonsils and surrounding pharyngeal soft tissues. The superior tonsil pole is supplied by the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> (DPA), the midfossa region by the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the inferior pole by the tonsillar and <b>ascending</b> <b>palatine</b> branches of the facial artery and the tonsillar branches of the lingual artery.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy and feasibility of superselective intra-arterial infusion of high-dose cisplatin with concomitant radiotherapy (hereafter RADPLAT) for head and neck squamous cell cancer (hereafter HNSCC) patients with retropharyngeal lymph node (hereafter RPLN) metastasis. Study Design: Retrospective case series review. Setting: University medical center in Japan. Subjects and Methods: Ten HNSCC patients with RPLN metastasis treated by RADPLAT were analyzed. Results: The ascending pharyngeal artery was targeted {{for the treatment of}} RPLN metastasis in 9 patients. The median total dose of cisplatin was 26. 6 mg/m 2 (mean, 31. 5 mg/m 2; range, 11. 7 - 87. 9 mg/m 2). In the remaining patient, the RPLN was supplied by the <b>ascending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> As grade 3 and 4 adverse effects, leukopenia was observed in three, mucositis in four and nausea in one patient. No neurological complications were observed in any patients. Metastatic RPLNs were evaluated as a complete response in all patients. There was no recurrence of RPLN metastasis in any patients. Four patients remain alive without any evidence of disease and six patients died of disease. The 5 -year overall survival rate was 50 %. Conclusions: We have shown that superselective intra-arterial cisplatin infusion for RPLNs was a feasible and effective approach for HNSCC patients with RPLN metastasis...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Understanding {{the anatomy}} of the pterygomaxillary {{junction}} region helps prevent blood loss in Le Fort I osteotomy. Here, we determined {{the location of the}} descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the structure of the pterygomaxillary region. Patients and methods: The study group consisted of 82 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry, with and without maxillary retrognathism or asymmetry. A total of 164 sides were measured and divided into right versus left, men versus women, and bimaxillary osteotomy (B) versus mandibular osteotomy (S). Lateral and frontal cephalograms and computed tomography (CT) were analysed for all patients. The relationship between the cephalometric measurements and the measurements of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and pterygoid plate (PP) were assessed. Results: There were no significant correlations between measurements of cephalograms and those of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and PPs. There were significant differences between right and left in lateral plate length (p = 0. 0014) and thickness of PP (p = 0. 0047). There were significant {{differences between men and women}} in right width of PP (p = 0. 0034), right thickness of PP (p = 0. 0063), left posterior length (p = 0. 0196), and left thickness of PP (p = 0. 0279). The B group had a shorter anterior length than the S group (right: p < 0. 0001, left: p = 0. 0027). Conclusion: These results suggest that the location of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the morphology of the PPs were not significantly associated with any cephalometric measurements.

30|$|The {{success rate}} of cleft palate surgery is {{influenced}} by many factors. The main flap for the cleft palate surgery is fed by the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> [24]. If the palatal defect is wide, the flap width will be narrowed. These long narrow flaps may cause problems with blood circulation, and wide expanses of exposed raw bone surface can cause extensive wound contracture after the operation [24 – 26]. Ischemic damage and wound contracture is {{the main cause of}} postoperative palatal fistula. The incidence of postoperative palatal fistula is reported to be 4.6 – 12.5 % and is dependent on the degree of the tissue defect [27]. Wound contracture after operation can cause shortening of the soft palate and may result in velopharyngeal insufficiency [28].|$|R
50|$|The lesser palatine canals {{start from}} the greater palatine canal, and run with them, also opening into {{the roof of the}} oral cavity.

30|$|The first {{description}} of a technique for closing oroantral fistula using a full-thickness palatal flap based on greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> dates back to Ashley [15]. Advantages of the palatal flap include high vascularity, generous thickness, and quality of tissue. Moreover, this flap is more resilient, less prone to infection, very resistant to lacerations, and {{does not lead to}} lowering of the vestibule. However, the most significant disadvantages are flap necrosis [15], exposed bony surface, pain, and development of surface irregularities as a result of secondary epithelialization post operatively [2]. In 1980, Ehrl employed this technique with wide fistulas of 1  cm in diameter [16]. The technique consists of excising the epithelium from its edges and incising the palatal fibro-mucosa so as to create a flap with a posterior base, supplied by the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> The anterior extension of the flap must be wide enough to exceed the diameter of the bony defect and long enough to allow lateral rotation. Tension-free suturing should be performed [8].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{separation}} of the pterygomaxillary region at the posterior nasal spine level after Le Fort I osteotomy in Class III patients. Patients and Methods: The study group consisted of 37 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry, with maxillary retrognathism or asymmetry. A total of 74 sides were examined. Le Fort I osteotomy was performed without a pterygoid osteotome, with an ultrasonic curette used to remove interference at the pterygomaxillary region. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) was analyzed for all patients. The separation of the pterygomaxillary region and the location of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> were assessed. Results: Although acceptable separation between the maxilla and pterygoid plates was achieved in all patients, an exact separation of the pterygomaxillary junction at the posterior nasal spine level was found in only 18 of 74 sides (24 %). In 29 of 74 sides (39. 2 %), the separation occurred anterior to the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> In 29 of 74 sides (39. 2 %), complete separation between the maxilla and lateral and/or medial pterygoid plate was not achieved, but lower level separation of the maxilla and pterygoid plate was always complete. The maxillary segments could be moved to the postoperative ideal position in all cases. Conclusion: Le Fort I osteotomy without an osteotome does not always induce an exact separation at the pterygomaxillary junction at the posterior nasal spine level, but the ultrasonic bone curette can remove the interference between maxillary segment and pterygoid plates more safely. © 2009 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons...|$|R

25|$|Internally, {{the lateral}} nasal wall is {{supplied}} with blood by the sphenopalatine artery (from behind and below) {{and by the}} anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery (from above and behind). The nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery, and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> These three (3) vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the Kiesselbach plexus (the Little area), which is a region in the anteroinferior-third of the nasal septum, (in front and below). Furthermore, the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation. The nasal veins are biologically significant, {{because they have no}} vessel-valves, and because of their direct, circulatory communication to the sinus caverns, which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose. Hence, because of such an abundant nasal blood supply, tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise post-operative healing.|$|R
