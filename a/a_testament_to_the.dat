5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, {{he did not believe}} in winning at any costs; he truly believed that {{the most important aspect of}} college football was the college football player. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character's {{enduring}} popularity, Irish bookmakers humorously {{began collecting}} bets on whether Dougal would succeed Pope John Paul II upon his death. The odds were 1,000-1 (better odds than some genuine candidates), and some small stakes were actually received.|$|R
50|$|Being {{born on a}} {{small island}} close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian Royal Navy based in Lumut, Dr. Zambry has a special rapport with <b>the</b> Malaysian Navy. <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> special camaraderie, the Malaysian of Armed Forces Council has conferred him with the Honorary First Admiral status in 2010.|$|R
2500|$|Situated on an oxbow in the Ohio River, {{the city}} is often {{referred}} <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> [...] "Crescent Valley" [...] or [...] "River City". <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ohio's grandeur, early French explorers named it La Belle Riviere ("The Beautiful River"). The area has been inhabited by various cultures for millennia, dating back at least 10,000 years. Angel Mounds was a permanent settlement of the Mississippian culture from 1000 AD to around 1400 AD. The city was founded in 1812.|$|R
5|$|Zahir {{allowed the}} Franciscan {{community}} of Nazareth to build churches in 1730, 1741 and 1754 on sites Christians associated with Jesus's life. He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth, and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest {{church in the}} city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built {{under the auspices of}} Zahir's less tolerant successors.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill in town and is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. It was around this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama conceived of creating a grand construction project as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> loyalty of Oyasama's followers.|$|E
50|$|And {{although}} marginalized {{within the}} ranks of the revolution with the ascendancy of a rival faction, Alvarez continued <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> cause of the revolution - <b>a</b> true <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character of this Caviteño.|$|R
25|$|Mining, {{although}} totally absent today, {{was once}} a major industry in the northern ranges. The copper mine at Kapunda, {{just north of the}} Barossa, operated from 1842 to 1877 and was a major boost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infant State's economy, but was soon overshadowed by the large workings at Burra, further north. The mine here operated from 1845 to 1877 with a few minor interruptions, and was superseded by even larger workings on <b>the</b> Yorke Peninsula. <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volume of copper at Burra, however, the mine re-opened as an open-cut in 1971, before closing again ten years later.|$|R
50|$|Canadas FIRST soldier Apprentice Harold Swain of Saskatchewan {{was sworn}} in December 1952, {{he went on to}} become a {{helicopter}} pilot, <b>a</b> further <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outstanding success of this program for young boys of Canada during the Cold War years.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a Pax Byzantina in these heartland territories.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San José {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This {{seems to be the case}} at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E
50|$|Craggy Island is a bleak, desolate {{community}} with no redeeming features whatsoever and where nothing ever happens, populated by various lunatics, a small Chinese community and one Māori. The weather is often harsh {{and just about}} every house and business is shoddily built. <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island's enduring unpopularity, the Irish state have given the British government permission <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> island's coast for dumping nuclear waste. The island isn't mentioned on any map and is frequently used by sailors as a navigational device (because, {{in the words of}} Father Ted Crilly, the general consensus is that, if you're heading away from the island, you're heading in the right direction).|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) {{postdoctoral}} fellowship programme {{was initiated}} in 1992 {{with the goal}} of promoting excellence in Canadian gastroenterological research. With backing from multiple pharmaceutical partners and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 87 fellows were funded {{over the next ten years}} for a total investment of $ 8, 730, 101. Between 1992 and 2000, fellows authored 247 articles; 176 being original research articles, 31 (17. 5 %) of which appeared in journals with impact factors of greater than 10. <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> program’s success in developing young scientists, 31 former fellows (36 %) have progressed <b>to</b> faculty positions. <b>The</b> fellowship programme continues to be an outstanding success and the flagship of CAG research activities...|$|R
25|$|It {{is notable}} that {{throughout}} the entire development process, which took place over twelve years, from 1935 through to 1948, there were no outstanding failures of the basic design: this is <b>a</b> real <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original genius of Reginald J. Mitchell, his successor Joseph Smith, and the design teams they led.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
5|$|With vastly {{superior}} numbers the Chinese {{had attacked}} {{on a broad}} front, and had initially overrun {{a number of the}} forward UN positions. Regardless, the 27th Brigade had ultimately prevailed despite being outnumbered by a factor of five to one. Indeed, despite their numerical advantage the Chinese had been badly outgunned and they could not overcome the well-trained and well-armed Australians and Canadians. The battlefield was littered with the corpses of Chinese soldiers, <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discipline and firepower of the defenders. And yet, despite their ultimate defeat, the battle once again demonstrated that the Chinese were tough and skillful soldiers capable of inflicting heavy casualties on the Australians and forcing their eventual withdrawal, albeit both intact and orderly. As a result of the fighting Australian losses were 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured, while Canadian casualties included 10 killed and 23 wounded. American casualties included three men killed, 12 wounded and two tanks destroyed, all from A Company, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. The New Zealanders lost two killed and five wounded. In contrast, Chinese losses were far heavier, and may have included 1,000 killed and many more wounded. The Canadians were finally relieved on Hill 677 by a battalion of the 5th US Cavalry Regiment on the evening 26 April.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of career choices is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{flexibility of the}} law degree that is awarded by the leading National Law Schools in India.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in October 1929, Midway Gardens {{was closed}} {{permanently}} and demolished. <b>A</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Wright's design, <b>the</b> building was so solidly constructed that tearing it down sent the wrecking company into bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{treatment}} <b>to</b> {{this point}} has been classical. It is <b>a</b> <b>testament,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> generality of Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics {{that the treatment}} can be made quantum mechanical with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities. The reinterpretation {{is based on the}} theories of Max Planck and the interpretation by Albert Einstein of those theories and of other experiments.|$|R
50|$|Brücius {{is known}} for using styles of blackline-work, {{scientific}} illustration and etching to create his tattoos. New York Artist and tattrx.com creator Morgan English wrote, “Brücius draws daily inspiration from endless sources: medieval engravings, wood-cut etchings, taxidermy, architecture, astronomy, as well as biological, nautical and anatomical illustrations. His work is <b>an</b> ever-evolving <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majesty {{of nature and the}} fascinating history of all humanity.|$|R
25|$|The Stanthorpe Soldiers Memorial is a {{memorial}} to those {{who served in the}} Great (and other later) wars but is also <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> community who built the memorial and remain as its custodians.|$|E
25|$|Ancestor worship {{is common}} in Vietnamese culture.

25|$|Jewish history, {{like all}} history, {{is a human}} saga, <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{significance}} of human power and human responsibility.

50|$|He {{has written}} operas, orchestral and chamber works, {{including}} the opera Winnie The Opera based on anti-apartheid activist Winnie Mandela. South Africa's liberation struggle {{seems to be}} a major theme in his orchestral works such as his piano concerto Mzilikazi: Emhlabeni, the short opera Hani on the anti-apartheid activist Chris Hani and more recently the oratorio Credo, <b>a</b> musical <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Freedom Charter.|$|R
2500|$|Toda died on April 2, 1958. The {{funeral was}} held at his home, but the coffin was {{afterwards}} carried past weeping, chanting crowds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ikebukuro temple Jozaiji, where he was buried. The then prime minister Nobusuke Kishi attended the funeral - something that scandalized [...] "quite a few Japanese" [...] but was <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> Gakkai had grown to {{a force to be}} reckoned with under Toda.|$|R
2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> its popularity, <b>the</b> novel {{went through}} four {{immediate}} editions.

25|$|It is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{good design}} and {{workmanship}} {{that went into}} his steam engines, that several of his big mill engines ran for over eighty years, and one of them, installed second-hand at the locomotive repair works at King's Cross, ran for over a century.|$|E
25|$|Two {{impressive}} viaducts {{remain on}} the completed part of the line between Royston Junction and Dewsbury as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Midland's ambition to complete a third direct Anglo-Scottish route. The line served two goods stations and provided a route for occasional express passenger trains before its eventual closure in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Hideaway Resorts CEO Mark Campbell and Director Andrew Menzies flew via {{helicopter}} to Dunk Island on 3 February 2011 {{to access the}} damage.

25|$|In {{addition}} to her fiction, Le Guin's book Out Here: Poems and Images from Steens Mountain Country, a collaboration with artist Roger Dorband, is <b>a</b> clear environmental <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural beauty of that area of Eastern Oregon.|$|R
50|$|Fluxton FC {{are known}} for their fluidic passing and high {{pressing}} game which gave them success last season as their 3-5-2 formation adopted by player manager Chris Sercombe forced a late surge to promotion.
