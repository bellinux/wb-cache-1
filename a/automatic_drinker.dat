30|$|Two hundred, 1 -day-old male Ross broiler {{chickens}} weighing 42  g {{on average}} {{were obtained from}} a commercial hatchery. Each treatment (or diet) included 50 birds randomly assigned with five replications of ten animals each. During the entire experiment, birds were housed in 20 floor pens with wood shavings as litter. Twenty-four hours of light per day were provided during the entire trial. Each pen had an <b>automatic</b> <b>drinker</b> and a feeder filled manually. Space allocation was at 10 birds per square meter. Water and feed were offered ad libitum. Birds were vaccinated on day 7 of the trial against fowlpox (by wing puncture) and against Newcastle (ocular) using the La Sota strain.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine parameters related to cattle’s health and the environment in which they live in cowsheds oriented at beef and milk production. The study included 70 cattle breeders from the pilskie county, Wielkopolskie province. Twenty of the surveyed farmers produced milk, 31 beef, and 19 produced both. The majority of the surveyed farmers worked on family run farms: taking up the area of up to 50 ha and the with up to 50 animals. Approximately 70 % of the surveyed farmers kept their animals tethered. Only more or less 40 % declared they owned a designated isolation area. <b>Automatic</b> <b>drinkers</b> were, unsurprisingly, present mostly at farms where either milk or both milk and beef were produced (over 60 %). Deworming was significantly more frequent on farms producing only beef (68. 97 %). Measurements of the intensity of harmful gases, airflow speed, humidity, and lighting intensity were conducted in only few cowsheds (up to 9 % of the analysed). The results of our study point to greater need of education among farmers, and improving environmental conditions in which cattle are maintained...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate, determine nutrient digestibility and nutritive value of lemon pulp and orange pulp. The citrus by-products were replaced for yellow corn in the basal diet at 3 levels (20, 40 and 60 %) for each by-product. A total number of 21 White New Zealand rabbits (NZW) at 8 weeks of age were individually weighed and randomly assigned individually into seven groups representing the seven experimental groups. Each group was divided into three replicates of one rabbit each. All animals were kept under the same management and hygienic conditions and were housed in metal battery cages supplied with separated feeders. Diets were offered ad-libitum and fresh water was available all times from <b>automatic</b> nipple <b>drinkers.</b> The experimental period lasted for 11 days. All rabbits were vaccinated against diseases and they were under veterinary control. The result showed that lemon and orange pulps are rich in CF, NDF, ADF, ADL, Hemi-cellulose and cellulose compared to yellow corn but CP and GE content for lemon and orange pulps are similarly equal compared to yellow corn. The content of vitamin C in lemon pulp and orange pulp was 0. 068 g/ 100 g and 0. 144 g/ 100 g compared with yellow corn 0. 030 g/ 100 g, respectively. The anti-oxidant content of lemon pulp and orange pulp was 11. 60 l and 12. 2 l compared the yellow corn (8. 29 l) at 25 l and 17. 9 l and 16. 4 l compared with 15. 24 l at 50 l, respectively. The total saturated fatty acids content of lemon pulp and yellow corn was approximately equal but its content in orange pulp was higher than the yellow corn. Total unsaturated fatty acids content of lemon pulp and orange pulp were to be lower than that in yellow corn. There were insignificant differences in DM and Organic Matter (OM) digestibility among the experimental diets and control diet. The obtained results also that 40 % substitution level of lemon pulp recorded the highest (p 0. 05) value for CP digestibility (84. 77 %) compared others substitution levels of lemon pulp and control diet. The digestibility of Crude Fiber (CF) was recorded highest (p 0. 05) value for 60 % substitution level of orange pulp when compared to the control diet and other tested levels of lemon pulp and orange pulp. The Ether Extract (EE) digestibility was recorded the lowest (p 0. 05) value with 60 % substitution of lemon and orange when compared to the control diet and other substitution levels of lemon pulp. The diet containing 20 % substitution level of orange pulp recorded highest (p 0. 05) digestibility of NFE. While, the diet containing 60 % substitution recorded lowest (p 0. 05) value of DCP when compared to control diet and other substitution levels of lemon pulp. The different substitution levels of orange pulp showed insignificant differences when compared to the control diet. The Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) and Digestible Energy (DE) recorded insignificant difference among control diet and 20, 40 and 60 % substitution levels of lemon pulp. The diet containing 20 % substitution level of orange pulp was higher in TDN and DE than the control diet. The diets containing 40 and 60 % substitution levels for orange pulp recorded insignificant differences when compared to the control diet. Conclusively, replacing lemon pulp at levels of 20 and 40 % and orange pulp at levels of 20 and 60 % for yellow corn in rabbit diets achieved best nutrients digestibility and nutritive value...|$|R
