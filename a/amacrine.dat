500|$|An {{additional}} {{group of}} dopamine-secreting neurons {{is found in}} the retina of the eye. [...] These neurons are <b>amacrine</b> cells, meaning that they have no axons. [...] They release dopamine into the extracellular medium, and are specifically active during daylight hours, becoming silent at night. [...] This retinal dopamine acts to enhance the activity of cone cells in the retina while suppressing rod cellsâ€”the result is to increase sensitivity to color and contrast during bright light conditions, at the cost of reduced sensitivity when the light is dim.|$|E
2500|$|Most neurons send signals via their axons, {{although}} some types {{are capable of}} dendrite-to-dendrite communication. [...] (In fact, the types of neurons called <b>amacrine</b> cells have no axons, and communicate only via their dendrites.) [...] Neural signals propagate along an axon {{in the form of}} electrochemical waves called action potentials, which produce cell-to-cell signals at points where axon terminals make synaptic contact with other cells.|$|E
2500|$|The {{grain of}} a {{photographic}} mosaic has just as limited resolving power as the [...] "grain" [...] of the retinal mosaic. In {{order to see}} detail, two sets of receptors must be intervened by a middle set. The maximum resolution is that 30 seconds of arc, corresponding to the foveal cone diameter or the angle subtended at the nodal point of the eye. In order to get reception from each cone, {{as it would be}} if vision was on a mosaic basis, the [...] "local sign" [...] must be obtained from a single cone via a chain of one bipolar, ganglion, and lateral geniculate cell each. A key factor of obtaining detailed vision, however, is inhibition. This is mediated by neurons such as the <b>amacrine</b> and horizontal cells, which functionally render the spread or convergence of signals inactive. This tendency to one-to-one shuttle of signals is powered by brightening of the center and its surroundings, which triggers the inhibition leading to a one-to-one wiring. This scenario, however, is rare, as cones may connect to both midget and flat (diffuse) bipolars, and <b>amacrine</b> and horizontal cells can merge messages just as easily as inhibit them.|$|E
2500|$|In sensory neurons, an {{external}} signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is {{coupled with the}} opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage. These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials. [...] Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and Meissner's corpuscle, which are critical for the sense of smell and touch, respectively. [...] However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon! Instead, they may convert the signal into {{the release of a}} neurotransmitter, or into continuous graded potentials, either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. [...] For illustration, in the human ear, hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels, which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some <b>amacrine</b> cells and the third layer, the ganglion cells, produce action potentials, which then travel up the optic nerve.|$|E
5000|$|Around 15% of <b>amacrine</b> {{cells are}} neither GABAergic or glycinergic. These <b>amacrine</b> cells are {{sometimes}} known as nGnG <b>amacrine</b> cells, {{and it is}} thought that transcription factors that act on progenitors decide the fate of <b>amacrine</b> cells. One transcription factor that was found to be selectively expressed in nGnG <b>amacrine</b> cells is Neurod6 ...|$|E
5000|$|Glycinergic <b>amacrine</b> cells aren't as {{extensively}} {{characterized as}} GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> cells. All glycinergic <b>amacrine</b> cells though, {{are marked by}} the glycine transporter GlyT1. One very well characterized glycinergic <b>amacrine</b> cell is the <b>Amacrine</b> cells. These cells {{are present in the}} INL. One importance function of the AII <b>amacrine</b> cells is that they capture cellular input from rod bipolar cells and redistribute it to cone bipolar cells using the synaptic endings of cone bipolar cells as adaptors ...|$|E
50|$|Length of {{dendritic}} arbors:Based on length, {{spread of}} dendritic arbors, <b>amacrine</b> cells {{can be categorized}} as narrow field <b>amacrine</b> cells (around 70 micrometers in diameter), medium field <b>amacrine</b> cells (around 170 micrometers in diameter) and wide field <b>amacrine</b> cells (around 350 micrometers in diameter). These different lengths lend to different specific functions that the <b>amacrine</b> cells can accomplish. Narrow field <b>amacrine</b> cells allow vertical communication among different retinal levels. They also aid in creating functional subunits in the receptive field of ganglion cells. These narrow field <b>amacrine</b> cells and their overlap in these subunits can allow certain ganglion cells to detect small amounts of movement of a very small spot {{in a field of}} vision. One type of narrow field cells that does this is the starburst <b>amacrine</b> cell.|$|E
50|$|GABAergic, glycinergic, or neither:Amacrine {{cells can}} be either GABAergic, glycinergic or neither {{depending}} on what inhibitory neurotransmitter they express (GABA, glycine, or neither). GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> cells are usually wide field <b>amacrine</b> cells and {{are found in the}} ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL). One type of GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> cell that is fairly well studied is the starburst <b>amacrine</b> cell. These <b>amacrine</b> cells are usually characterised by their expression of choline acetyltransferase, or ChAT and are known {{to play a role in}} direction selectivity and detection of directional motion. Acetylcholine is also released from these <b>amacrine</b> cells, but its function is not completely understood. Another subtype of GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> cells are those that are dopaminergic. These are all TH expressing and these <b>amacrine</b> cells modulate light adaption and circadian rhythm. These are widely spreading <b>amacrine</b> cells, and they diffusely release dopamine, while still releasing GABA and carrying out all normal synaptic release. Many other divisions of GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> cells have been noted, but those listed above are some of the most extensively researched and discussed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amacrine</b> cells {{operate at}} the inner plexiform layer (IPL), the second {{synaptic}} retinal layer where bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells form synapses. There {{are at least}} 33 different subtypes of <b>amacrine</b> cells based just on their dendrite morphology and stratification. Like horizontal cells, <b>amacrine</b> cells work laterally, but whereas horizontal cells {{are connected to the}} output of rod and cone cells, <b>amacrine</b> cells affect the output from bipolar cells, and are often more specialized. Each type of <b>amacrine</b> cell releases one or several neurotransmitters where it connects with other cells.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, the subtype of the <b>amacrine</b> cell {{speaks to}} its {{function}} (form leads to function), but some specific {{functions of the}} retinal <b>amacrine</b> cells can be outlined.|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} <b>amacrine</b> cell {{are likely to}} play modulatory roles, {{allowing}} adjustment of sensitivity for photopic and scotopic vision. The AII <b>amacrine</b> cell is a mediator of signals from rod cells under scotopic conditions.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Neural mechanism: starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Amacrine</b> cells (also brachine cells (short) and shortine cells) are interneurons in the retina. They {{are named}} from the Greek roots a- ("non"), makr- ("long") and in- ("fiber"), {{because of their}} short neuritic processes. <b>Amacrine</b> cells are {{inhibitory}} neurons, and project their dendritic arbors to the inner plexiform layer (IPL), there interacting with retinal ganglion cells and/or bipolar cells.|$|E
50|$|Bipolar cells {{effectively}} {{transfer information}} from rods and cones to ganglion cells. The horizontal cells and the <b>amacrine</b> cells complicate matters somewhat. The horizontal cells introduce lateral inhibition and {{give rise to}} the center-surround inhibition which is apparent in retinal receptive fields. The <b>amacrine</b> cells also introduce lateral inhibition, however, its role is not yet well understood.|$|E
50|$|There {{is still}} much to be {{discovered}} {{about all of the}} different functions of all of the different <b>amacrine</b> cells. <b>Amacrine</b> cells with extensive dendritic trees are thought to contribute to inhibitory surrounds by feedback at both the bipolar cell and ganglion cell levels. In this role they are considered to supplement the action of the horizontal cells.|$|E
50|$|Retinal neurons include {{photoreceptor}} cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, <b>amacrine</b> cells, and ganglion cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{four types}} of retinal neurons are bipolar cells, {{ganglion}} cells, horizontal cells, and <b>amacrine</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} (published March 2011) {{relying on}} serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) {{has led to}} identification of the circuitry that influences directional selectivity. This new technique provides detailed images of calcium flow and anatomy of dendrites of both starburst <b>amacrine</b> (SAC) and DS ganglion cells. By comparing the preferred directions of ganglion cells with their synapses on SAC's, Briggman et al. provide evidence for a mechanism primarily based on inhibitory signals from SAC's based on an oversampled serial block-face scanning electron microscopy study of one sampled retina, that retinal ganglion cells may receive asymmetrical inhibitory inputs directly from starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells, and therefore computation of directional selectivity also occurs postsynaptically. Such postsynaptic models are unparsimonious, and so if any given starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells conveys motion information to retinal ganglion cells then any computing of 'local' direction selectivity postsynaptically by retinal ganglion cells is redundant and dysfunctional. An acetylcholine (ACh) transmission model of directionally selective starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells provides a robust topological underpinning of a motion sensing in the retina.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{there are}} several different ways to divide the {{many different types of}} <b>amacrine</b> cells into subtypes.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, the {{horizontal}} and <b>amacrine</b> cells {{play a significant}} role in this process but that is not represented here.|$|E
50|$|The five basic {{classes of}} neurons within the retina are {{photoreceptor}} cells, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and <b>amacrine</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|The six {{types of}} retinal neurons are bipolar cells, {{ganglion}} cells, horizontal cells, retina <b>amacrine</b> cells, and rod and cone photoreceptors.|$|E
5000|$|Inner nuclear layer - {{contains}} the nuclei and surrounding cell bodies (perikarya) of the <b>amacrine</b> cells, bipolar cells and horizontal cells.|$|E
5000|$|Inner plexiform layer - {{contains}} the synapse between the bipolar cell axons and the dendrites of the ganglion and <b>amacrine</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{ganglion}} {{cell layer}} (ganglionic layer) is {{a layer of}} the retina that consists of retinal ganglion cells and displaced <b>amacrine</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|While some non-spiking neurons are {{specifically}} involved in neuromuscular modulation, studying <b>amacrine</b> cells has created opportunities {{to discuss the}} role of non-spiking neurons in neuroplasticity. Since <b>amacrine</b> cells, which are a type of non-spiking neurons, undergo a transformation from spiking to non-spiking cells, {{there have been many}} studies that try to identify the functional reasons for such a transformation. Starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells use action potentials during retinal development, and once the retina is mature, these cells transform into non-spiking neurons. The change from a cell that can generate action potentials to solely functioning off of a graded potential is drastic, and may provide insight into why the two kinds of neural networks exist. The cells lose sodium channels. The loss of the sodium channels is triggered by the opening of the eye correlating to the possibility of the environment playing a crucial role in determination of neural cell types. The rabbit animal model was used to develop this particular study. This transition is not quite understood but heavily concludes that the spiking and non-spiking statuses occupied by the starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells are vital to the maturation of the eyes.|$|E
50|$|Cholinergic wave {{activity}} eventually dies out and {{the release}} of glutamate in bipolar cells generates waves. Bipolar cells differentiate later than <b>amacrine</b> and ganglion cells which could be the cause for this switch in wave behavior.The change from cholinergic mediation to glutamatergic mediation occurs when bipolar cells make their first synaptic connections with ganglion cells. Glutamate, the neurotransmitter contained in bipolar cells, generates spontaneous activity in ganglion cells. Waves are still present after bipolar cells make synaptic connection with <b>amacrine</b> and ganglion cells.|$|E
5000|$|Ganglion {{cell layer}} - {{contains}} nuclei of ganglion cells, the axons of which become the optic nerve fibres for messages and some displaced <b>amacrine</b> cells ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Amacrine</b> {{cells and}} other retinal interneuron cells {{are less likely}} to be near {{neighbours}} of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in 'exclusion zones' that separate them. Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements. MEGF10 and MEGF11 transmembrane proteins have critical roles in the formation of the mosaics by starburst <b>amacrine</b> cells and horizontal cells in mice.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>amacrine</b> {{cells are}} placed in the inner part of the inner nuclear layer, and are so named {{because they have not}} yet been shown to possess axis-cylinder processes.|$|E
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{expression of}} Med27 mRNA suggests a universal requirement for Med27 in transcriptional initiation. Loss of Crsp34/Med27 decreases <b>amacrine</b> cell number, but increases {{the number of}} rod photoreceptor cells.|$|E
50|$|Medium field <b>amacrine</b> cells also {{contribute}} to vertical communication in {{the cells of the}} retina, but much of their overall function is still unknown. Due to the fact that their dendritic arbor size is pretty similar to that of ganglion cells, they could blur the edge of the ganglion cell visual field. Similarly, wide field <b>amacrine</b> cells are hard to research and even discover because they span the entire retina so there aren't many of them. In light of their size though, one of their main functions is lateral communication within a layer, though some also communicate vertically among layers.|$|E
5000|$|Scotopic {{vision is}} {{dominated}} by retina <b>amacrine</b> cells, specifically AII-amacrine cells. AII-amacrine cells capture rod bipolar cell input and redistribute it to cone bipolar cells since rod-driven bipolar cells do not synapse on ganglion cells.|$|E
50|$|The inner nuclear layer or {{layer of}} inner granules, of the retina, {{is made up}} of a number of closely packed cells, of which there are three varieties, viz.: bipolar cells, {{horizontal}} cells, and <b>amacrine</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|A retinal {{ganglion}} cell (RGC) {{is a type}} of neuron {{located near}} the inner surface (the ganglion cell layer) of the retina of the eye. It receives visual information from photoreceptors via two intermediate neuron types: bipolar cells and retina <b>amacrine</b> cells. Retina <b>amacrine</b> cells, particularly narrow field cells, are important for creating functional subunits within the ganglion cell layer and making it so that ganglion cells can observe a small dot moving a small distance. Retinal ganglion cells collectively transmit image-forming and non-image forming visual information from the retina in the form of action potential to several regions in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon, or midbrain.|$|E
