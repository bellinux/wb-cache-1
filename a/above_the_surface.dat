5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20â€“30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100km <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind drape over Mars, into the atmosphere, and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E

5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E

There are multiple Waterfire events that are accompanied by various pieces of classical and world music. The public art displays change on a regular basis, most notably the sculptures.|$|E

5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} be {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species.

5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. They formed when {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer {{at the bottom of}} the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> forming raised bogs.|$|E

5|$|The {{troposphere}} on Venus contains 99% of {{the atmosphere}} by mass. Ninety percent {{of the atmosphere}} of Venus is within 28km of the surface; by comparison, 90% of the atmosphere of Earth is within 10km of the surface. At a height of 50km the atmospheric pressure is approximately equal to that at the surface of Earth. On the night side of Venus clouds can still be found at 80km <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|While breathing, {{they hold}} just their {{nostrils}} <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> sometimes standing on their tails to do so. Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, {{but have been}} known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish. Males typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating. Sirenians are K-selectors, and display parental care.|$|E

40|$|DE 102009050426 B 3 UPAB: 20110418 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{providing a}} carrier substrate with metallization surfaces i. e. pads, having hydrophilic or lipophilic characteristics, where areas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> are hydrophobic or lipophobic. Components are applied on fluid assembling medium i. e. conductive adhesive, provided at <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> components are {{held at a}} <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> medium based on <b>surface</b> tension of <b>the</b> medium to align <b>the</b> components <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> aligned components are fixed on the substrate by electrostatic force by applying electrical holding voltage <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of <b>the</b> substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing a carrier substrate with metallization surfaces. USE - Method for aligned application of microelectronic components i. e. silicon chips with switching structures, on a carrier substrate e. g. wafer substrate, glass substrate, polymer substrate and flexible film substrate, for assembling a target substrate with the components. Can {{also be used for}} applying mechanical components and optical components such as LEDs. ADVANTAGE - The method durably and reversibly fixes the components on the carrier substrate, and facilitates alignment of the components on the substrate...|$|R

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the planet is nearly {{the same as that}} of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} of sustained winds {{recommended by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies {{is that of a}} 10-minute average at a height of 10m (33ft). However, the Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10m (33ft) <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
