Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

25|$|Particulates, {{alternatively}} {{referred to}} as particulate matter (PM), <b>atmospheric</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the {{burning of fossil fuels}} in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, altered lung function and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|As the Games began, {{air quality}} in Beijing {{improved}} significantly against prior expectations. Air quality throughout the Games recorded API scores under 100, the official target.

The materials used for supporting PM samples, desorption temperature and time, and types of sample injection were investigated for the detection of sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nine n-alkanes. The limits of detection of the proposed TD-GC method were in the range of 0. 014 - 0. 094 ng for PAHs, and 0. 016 - 0. 026 ng for n-alkanes, with coefficients of correlation above 0. 9975. The TD-GC method was applied to the determination of trace PAHs and n-alkanes on PM 10 samples from three cities. The recoveries were in the range of 95 %. 135 % (PAHs) and 95 %- 115 % (n-alkanes). Finally, the TD was coupled to GC-MS for comparison of the contents of PAHs and n-alkanes on PMx with different particulate size (x = 10, 5, 2, 1, 0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 1) ...|$|R

In both of the sampling sites, the highest concentration of PM was observed during the summer season (521. 6, 329. 1, 42. 6, and 36. 5 for TSP, PM 10, PM 2. 5, and PM 1, respectively). A total of 11 inorganic water-soluble ions in the TSP and PM 10 were identified by ion chromatography (IC). No statistically significant difference was found between PM’s ions concentrations of two sampling sites. The average of the total measured water-soluble ions in the sampling sites was 28. 75 ± 12. 9 μg/m 3 (11. 9 ± 4. 8 % of total TSP mass) for TSP and 14. 65 ± 7. 1 μg/m 3 (8. 7 ± 4. 4 of total PM 10 mass) for PM 10. Among all detected ions, sulfate was the dominant constituent followed by nitrate and sodium. This study showed that the water soluble salts compose 3 – 20 % of the total mass of TSP and PM 10.

Methods: Data on hospital admissions for COPD and PM 2. 5 levels were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research database (NHIRD) and the Environmental Protection Administration from 2008 to 2010, respectively. The lag structure of relative risks (RRs) of hospital admissions for COPD was estimated using a Poisson regression model. Results: During the study period, the overall average hospitalization rate of COPD and mean 24 -h average level of PM 2. 5 was 0. 18 % and 39. 37 μg/m 3, respectively. There were seasonal variations in PM 2. 5 concentrations in southwestern Taiwan, with higher PM 2. 5 concentrations in both spring (average: 48. 54 μg/m 3) and winter (49. 96 μg/m 3) than in summer (25. 89 μg/m 3) and autumn (33. 37 μg/m 3). Increased COPD admissions were significantly associated with PM 2. 5 in both spring (February–April) and winter (October–January), with the relative risks (RRs) for every 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2. 5 being 1. 25 (95 % CI = 1. 22 – 1. 27) and 1. 24 (95 % CI = 1. 23 – 1. 26), respectively, at a lag zero days (i. e., no lag days). Lag effects on COPD admissions were observed for PM 2. 5, with the elevated RRs beginning at lag zero days and larger RRs estimates tending to occur at longer lags (up to six days, i. e., lag 0 – 5 days).

Trace metals were extracted from filters with digestion method using a mixture of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2. The average concentration of the determined trace metals of As, Cd, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr, Fe, Mn, Zn, Sband Se were 3. 06, 6. 28, 3. 77, 11. 98, 305. 6, 9. 2, 2057. 0, 42. 2, 303. 3, 5. 47 and 2. 43 ng·m- 3, respectively. Arsenic concentration is much lower in the atmosphere of Dhaka, though Bangladesh has severe arsenic problem in the ground water. Lead and cadmium concentrations showed decreasing trend in Dhaka compared than previous measurements—but still they have very high levels compared than Europe and USA. There is very limited information for Mn, Sb and Se concentrations in Dhaka air. Correlation studies showed that several trace metals had potential joint sources of origin, e. g., manganese is highly correlated with iron (r 2 = 0. 97) and nickel (r 2 = 0. 84), copper (r 2 = 0. 86); lead with arsenic (r 2 = 0. 79) and antimony (r 2 = 0. 78). Enrichment factors analysis was also done with the data base for the respective metals in earth crust and coal fly ash. As and Cu both have combined sources, whereas Cd, Pb and Zn were from coal fly ash. Trace metals concentrations in Dhaka city air were much higher than Europe and USA but comparable or slightly lower than other south Asian countries.
