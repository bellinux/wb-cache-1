50|$|<b>Charge</b> in <b>the</b> {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates {{positive and negative}} charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the metal plate (or other storage conductor), and <b>the</b> opposite <b>charge</b> is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the metal plate). This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects.

50|$|After a cell has {{established}} a resting potential, that cell {{has the capacity to}} undergo depolarization. During depolarization, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> within <b>the</b> cell rapidly shifts from negative to positive. For this rapid change to take place within the interior of the cell, several events must occur along the plasma membrane of the cell as well. While the sodium potassium pump continues to work, the voltage gated ion channels that had been closed while the cell was at resting potential have been opened by an electrical stimulus. As the sodium rushes back into the cell the positive sodium ions <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> inside <b>the</b> cell from negative to positive.

40|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a {{regulatory}} hormone widely expressed, {{along with its}} receptors, in organs and body tissues. ANP is well known to inhibit aldosterone secretion from mammalian adrenals, but its effect on glucocorticoid-hormone production is controversial. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged ANP <b>administration</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> plasma concentration of cortisol in both normal and dexamethasone/captopril-treated guinea pigs (i. e. in animals with pharmacologically interrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system). ANP did not affect cortisol secretion from dispersed guinea pig zona fasciculata-reticularis cells, but enhanced catecholamine release from adrenomedullary cells. ANP stimulated cortisol output from guinea pig adrenal slices containing medullary chromaffin tissue, and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol blocked this effect. The conclusion is drawn that ANP, when the structural integrity of the adrenal gland is preserved, is able to enhance glucocorticoid secretion in guinea pigs, through an indirect mechanism involving {{the rise in the}} catecholamine release, which in turn, acting in a paracrine manner, stimulate secretion of inner adrenocortical cells...|$|R

30|$|Regarding branch-free rods, less {{accumulation}} on {{the electrode}} layer leads to poor electrolyte filling, improving the recombination pathway and <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> transport resistance. <b>The</b> surface <b>charge</b> density and trap {{level of the}} ZnO layer also {{play an important role}} in deciding <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> transport resistance by depleting <b>the</b> space <b>charge</b> layer. <b>The</b> drift transport that occurs when a 1 D photoanode contacts electrolyte redox carriers is detrimental to efficacious charge transport. This requires further discussion [22, 12]. EIS measurement was used to obtain the Bode plots of the lifetimes displayed in Table  1. This table shows that the tree-like ZnO structure DSSCs exhibit a longer electron lifetime (τeff[*]=[*] 3.91  ms) than that of the NRs DSSCs (τeff[*]=[*] 3.28  ms). The longer lifetime implies lower recombination rate and increased electron-collection efficiency, and thus the parameter can be related to the improvement in cell efficiency.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{diesel engines}} are seeing {{increasing}} system and after-treatment complexity {{which can lead}} to significant increases in the exhaust back pressure (EBP). This increases the amount of trapped residuals, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> temperature but reducing the oxygen concen-tration. In this work, these effects of the EBP on diesel engine performance and emissions under conventional and low-temperature diesel combustion (LTC) regimes were investigated. Increasing the EBP resulted in higher pumping work for both combustion modes. While for conventional diesel combustion the effect of the EBP on combustion and emissions were not significant, for LTC the higher back pressures influenced the combustion and emissions for-mation processes. At low-load conditions, the increase in <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> temperature advanced combustion; at intermediate-load conditions, the reduction in the oxygen concentration delayed it. Smoke emissions were significantly reduced by a higher back pressure at intermediate-load conditions...|$|R

40|$|In the {{scientific}} literature, {{little attention has}} been paid to the disposition of fipronil, a phenyl pyrazole insecticide. In this study, the tissue distribution, the metabolic fate, and the elimination of fipronil was investigated in rats using radiolabeled fipronil. When a single oral dose of (14) C-fipronil (10 mg kg(- 1) b. w.) was given to rats, the proportion of dose eliminated in urine and feces 72 h after dosing was ca 4 % for each route. At the end of the experiment the highest levels of radioactivity were found in adipose tissue and adrenals. The main part of the radioactivity present in investigated tissues (adipose tissue, adrenals, liver, kidney, testes) was due to fipronil-sulfone. Five additional metabolites, isolated from urine were characterized by LC-MS/MS. Most of them are formed by the loss of the trifluoromethylsulphinyl group and subsequent hydroxylation and/or conjugation to glucuronic acid or sulfate. In conclusion, the retention of the metabolite fipronil sulfone in tissues following fipronil <b>administration</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> question of the potential toxicity of this insecticide...|$|R
