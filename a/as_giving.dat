5|$|In a World Tomorrow episode {{broadcast}} on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia {{not to sell}} arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain, and in July, shortly before Rajab's arrest, {{he noted that the}} presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made the struggle against the monarchy more difficult because US support, accompanied by the support, or silence, of the international community, was seen <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> the green light for repression and attacks on human rights defenders.|$|E

5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E

5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} Sycorax, a foil for Prospero, {{is closely related}} to the Medea of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Postcolonialist writers and critics see Sycorax <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> voice to peoples, particularly women, recovering from the effects of colonisation. Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of the Vortigaunt has been popular enough to inspire {{the creation of a}} Vortigaunt plush toy. The toy was designed by Dhabih Eng and was sold and distributed via Valve's online store. The toy was released in December 2006 and due to the proximity to Christmas, the Vortigaunt was accompanied by a to-scale Santa Claus hat. Reviews of the plush toy were favorable, praising the toy as sturdy, as well <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> credit for its articulation and detail.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E

5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

He consecrated Herewald as Bishop of Llandaff at a council held at London in 1056, although this information is only attested in the Book of Llandaff, a sometimes unreliable source. In 1059 he, along with Earl Tostig and Æthelwine Bishop of Durham, escorted King Malcolm III of Scotland to King Edward's court at Gloucester when Malcolm came south, probably to thank Edward for his help in restoring Malcolm to the Scottish throne, and perhaps to acknowledge the English king as Malcolm's lord.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E

5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such <b>as</b> <b>giving</b> the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score. Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E
