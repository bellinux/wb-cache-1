2500|$|During May 1988 Hussey was {{the record}} {{producer}} and arranger on Daryl Braithwaite's comeback solo album, Edge, which was issued in November. He also played keyboards, programmed the drum machine and wrote or co-wrote four tracks: [...] "You Could Be Wrong" [...] (by Hussey), [...] "Let Me Be" [...] (from Cats Under Pressure, by Hussey and David Reyne), [...] "All the Same" [...] (by Hussey, Bade and Greig) and [...] "Edge" [...] (by Hussey and Jef Scott). Edge peaked at No.1 on the ARIA Albums Chart {{for three weeks}} in mid-1989. Kathryn Whitfield of The Canberra Times felt the album was [...] "Verging on noddy-land, this piece of plastic is soft-sell. Easy listening, inoffensive, palatable, commercial pop music." [...] She explained that [...] "Hussey (keyboards) {{appears to have been}} the one to roll up his sleeves <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on material for this offering." [...] Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, opined that the album and singles had [...] "captured a wonderful summer-filled mood, and a sense of freedom and happiness". Four tracks on Edge had John Farnham on backing vocals.|$|E

6000|$|... "Instead of hurrying home <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> himself, Mr. Rabbit {{stopped a}} while after each call and sat with his arms folded, {{watching}} the one he was calling on work. Mr. Rabbit was very fond of sitting with folded arms. It was very comfortable. But this {{was no time to}} be doing it, and Mr. Skunk told him so.|$|R

6000|$|The men {{leaped to}} their feet; in another moment they had {{snatched}} picks, pans, and shovels, and, the foreman leading, with a {{coil of rope}} thrown over his shoulders, were all flying down the trail to the highway. Their haste was wise. The spring was not on THEIR claim; it was known to others; it was doubtful if Parkhurst's discovery with his knife amounted to actual WORK on the soil.

6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I only {{propose to}} write a single line to say we are still around. Ah, I have such a deep, grateful, unutterable sense of being [...] "out of it all."

When people tell me England has declared war, I drop the subject, feeling that it is none of my business; when they tell me Mrs. Tilton has confessed and Mr. B. denied, I say both of them have done that before, therefore let the worn stub of the Plymouth white-wash brush be brought out once more, and let the faithful spit on their hands <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> again regardless of me--for I am out of it all.|$|E

That little monkey of a Jims took so much time. But he was growing--he was certainly growing.

6000|$|Five {{more days}} passed, all too quickly, {{and once more}} Monday came round. It was the 22nd of October, and the Michaelmas Sittings began on the 24th. On the morrow, Tuesday, Geoffrey was to return to London, there to meet Lady Honoria <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at Chambers. That very morning, indeed, a brief, the biggest he had yet received--it was marked thirty guineas--had been {{forwarded}} to him from his chambers, with a note from his clerk {{to the effect that}} the case was expected to be in the special jury list {{on the first day of}} the sittings, and that the clerk had made an appointment for him with the solicitors for 5.15 on the Tuesday. The brief was sent to him by his uncle's firm, and marked, [...] "With you the Attorney-General, and Mr. Candleton, Q.C.," [...] the well-known leader of the Probate and Divorce Court Bar.

And, do you know, Uncle, that it might be well to double that [...] little army of yours that you are arranging for Rupert? Indeed, the [...] boy told me himself {{that he was going to}} write to you about it. I [...] think old Lachlan and his wife, Sandy's Mary, had better be in charge [...] of the maids when they come over.
