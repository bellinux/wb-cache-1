O. Box TL 1882 N, Ghana, Email:gordanak@gmail. com Transcript Vohman	My name is Erika Vohman. I am the Founder and Executive Director of the Equilibrium Fund. The maya nut tree {{is one of the largest}} trees in the rainforest. It grows to be about 45 metres tall. It is one of the most important species for biodiversity. Almost all the wildlife in the rainforest eat the maya nut seed and it also happens to be a nutritious, delicious and native food that can be harvested by rural communities for food and income. Oladele 	I am Oladele O Idowu from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. I work on neglected food crops, contribution to household food security and health among rural dwellers in the rural states of Nigeria. Bitter Kola is found on farmlands and then at some other times is propagated and once it starts fruiting a lot of fruit can be obtained and it has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> shelf life. Berisavljevic 	My name is Gordana Kranjac-Berisavljevic and I work with the University for Development Studies in northern Ghana in the savannah area where a lot of neglected crops are grown. There are two interesting crops. One is African rice, Oryza glaberrima which is grown mostly by women in the northern part of Ghana and then also processed by women. It is a major women?s industry. The second interesting crop is yam which is grown solely by men. Le Breton	My name is Gus Le Breton, I am from PhytoTrade Africa which is the Southern African Natural Products Trade Association and I am based in Zimbabwe. A species that we have been working with for the last several years is marula, and the marula tree is found, it is spread all over Africa but particular concentrations in southern Africa and it is a traditional fruit which is harvested mostly by women for eating and also for brewing beer. Vohman	The women of Central America and Mexico are able to harvest the seed from the maya nut tree and use that for food and also as a source of income. Oladele	Households are generally involved because apart from the propagated ones, most of these are trees that have been there for years so they serve a purpose for the household because maybe it is located on the family land, on individual land and even sometimes on individual land there are other parts of the family or the household that can still lay claim to it. Berisavljevic	People grow yam not necessarily only for commercial reasons but for various cultural, spiritual and religious reasons and they strongly believe that women can only sell yam but they cannot cultivate it because traditional knowledge is embodied in it. It has also to do with the social structure where, as you grow older, you gradually learn more and more about how to cultivate yam. Le Breton	In Namibia, for the women in northern Namibia, it is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> big deal every year when they harvest marula. It is a business that is pretty much exclusively controlled by women. In many countries in southern Africa there is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high cultural value associated with the species and there are special marula ceremonies during the harvesting season which is about two or three months, January, February, March. Vohman	Most of the women in Central America and Mexico that are working with the maya nut are marketing it locally, because they are not so interested in dealing with all the paperwork and legalities involved in export. Oladele	Women are still able to market and get income but essentially the household benefits from these crops in terms of the consumption of the crops and then incomes that they are able to make from it. Most of the leaves or the fruits that are harvested are taken to local markets for sale, and income derived can be used in paying school fees, for social meetings and for some other things. Berisavljevic	Increasingly yam is exported from Ghana to the foreign markets and specially to diaspora. There are a lot of Ghanaians living all around the world. Much more yam is grown for domestic use, it is grown for social reasons, like there are special big types of yam that you give to your father-in-law. Le Breton	They formed a cooperative and they have built their own factory and they have oil processing facilities at this factory. So the producers sell the kernel to the cooperative, the cooperative processes it into oil and the oil is then sold through export channels to international cosmetic companies. Vohman	I think when we are working with underutilised species and also with rural communities it is important to be very patient because rural communities are often in a process of development. It is as much as a personal development as economic development, and personal human development can often be very slow, especially when communities are not used to taking charge of their lives. Oladele	Things that are regarded useless or weeds or unusable can tapped into, either as human foods or animal feeds or things like that. Berisavljevic	There are many more crops we should grow than those we are actually using and probably the culture and the social set up of people has a major role to play and we should try to promote what we locally have. Le Breton	I think the key lesson is not to rush into it, not to try to do too many things at once, keep it simple, work in a steady direction towards a single goal and ultimately we can achieve tremendous things. Because this marula for example, one day we might be able to sell two or three thousand tonnes of marula oil a year, into the cosmetics industry but at the moment we are selling probably less than ten tonnes a year. So we still have <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go. End of track. Traditional crops often have cultural significance beyond their value as a source of food. In southern Africa, marula fruit are traditionally harvested by women, and there are special ceremonies during the harvesting season. In northern Ghana, yams have cultural and spiritual significance and are only grown by men. Four researchers discuss the social significance of traditional food plants in Africa and Central America...|$|R

2500|$|A non-competitive {{adventure}} activity involving {{riding the}} biggest waves possible (known as [...] "rhino hunting") is also popular with some surfers. [...] A practice popularized in the 1990s has seen big wave surfing revolutionized, as surfers use personal watercraft to tow {{them out to}} {{a position where they}} can catch previously unrideable waves (see tow-in surfing). These waves were previously unrideable due to the speed at which they travel. Some waves reach speeds of over 60km/h; personal watercraft enable surfers to catch up to the speed of the wave, thereby making them rideable. Personal watercraft also allow surfers to survive wipeouts. In many instances surfers would not survive the battering of the [...] "sets" [...] (groups of waves together). This spectacular activity is extremely popular with television crews, but because such waves rarely occur in heavily populated regions, and usually only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> out to sea on outer reefs, few spectators see such events directly.|$|E

2500|$|A giant called Gwendol Wrekin ap Shenkin ap Mynyddmawr with {{a grudge}} against {{the town of}} Shrewsbury decided to flood the town and kill all its inhabitants. So he {{collected}} a giant-sized spadeful of earth and set off towards the town. When {{in the vicinity of}} Wellington he met a cobbler returning from Shrewsbury market with a large sackful of shoes for repair. The giant asked him for directions, adding {{that he was going to}} dump his spadeful of earth in the River Severn and flood the town. [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to Shrewsbury," [...] replied the quick-thinking shoemaker. [...] "Look at all these shoes I've worn out walking back from there!" [...] The giant immediately decided to abandon his enterprise and dumped the earth on the ground beside him, where it became the Wrekin. The giant also scraped the mud off his boots, which became the smaller hill Ercall Hill nearby. Ironically Shrewsbury is subjected to flooding from the River Severn on frequent occasions naturally."All around the Wrekin" [...] or [...] "Running round the Wrekin" [...] is a phrase common in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, Herefordshire, the Black Country, Birmingham to mean [...] "the long way round", in the same way that [...] "round the houses" [...] is used more widely.

2500|$|A {{larger and}} more {{controversial}} change occurred as from 2 June 2002, when the discount level was changed: a minimum adult fare of £10.00 was imposed for weekday journeys, and children now received an 81% discount on the full adult fare (equivalent to a 60% on the full child fare, and subject to a minimum fare of £1.00) instead of the former £1.00 flat fare for all journeys. [...] This meant that on a weekday, holders would receive no discount if the standard adult full fare was £10.00 or less, and a discount of less than 34% on fares between £10.05 and £15.00. [...] Longer journeys for children would also become more expensive. [...] Transport pressure group Transport 2000 and environmental organisation Friends of the Earth condemned the proposals, and Reading East MP Jane Griffiths tabled an Early Day Motion in the British Parliament opposing the changes. [...] This gained the support of 38 other MPs from all major parties. [...] Research commissioned by Transport 2000 indicated that 90% of journeys typically made in the railcard area would no longer gain any discount (as {{a result of the}} full adult fare being £10.00 or below), a further 3.5% would attract a discount of less than 34%, and only 6.5% would still be subject to the full 34% discount as before. [...] This reflects the fact that many journeys undertaken in the area are short and [...] "local" [...] in nature, and that the area as a whole is fairly small in size (as [...] shows, it does not extend <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from London in any direction).|$|E
