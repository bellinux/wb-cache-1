5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth.

5|$|A {{network of}} tunnels exists under the prison, built {{to provide the}} prison, and later the town of Fremantle, with <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> fresh water. Other {{elements}} of the site include the hospital building, prisoner workshops, open spaces, and a limestone ramp on the axis of the gatehouse, heading down towards the port area of Fremantle. Archaeological zones and sub-surface remains of varying levels of significance are found throughout {{the area of the}} convict grant.|$|E
5|$|A {{park was}} {{established}} {{next to the}} castle; a park was highly prestigious and it enabled Thomas to engage in hunting, provided the castle with <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> venison as well as generating income. Most of the village of Wittenham had to be destroyed {{to make way for}} the park and the site eventually became a deserted village. A new parish church, St Leonard's Chapel, was built by Thomas just outside the castle, after he had demolished the earlier, simpler 12th-century church during the construction of the inner court. Thomas died in 1397 and was buried in the newly built St Anne's Chapel, forming the north transept of St Leonard's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> 929 M249 SAWs {{was issued}} to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E
5|$|After a final {{check of}} the weather reports for Germany and the North Sea, Hess took off at 17:45 on 10 May 1941 from the {{airfield}} at Augsburg-Haunstetten in his specially prepared aircraft. It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{study how}} two {{dimensions}} of market conditions affect behavior in experimental gift-exchange markets with repeated interaction. First, {{we consider the}} impact of competitive imbalance, by varying whether there is <b>an</b> excess <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> firms or <b>an</b> excess <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> workers in the market. Second, we impose a minimum wage in the market with <b>an</b> excess <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> workers, and study the overall effect on wages and productivity. Perhaps surprisingly, the state of competition {{does not appear to}} have strong effects in our data; however, there is some evidence of lower productivity when a minimum wage is imposed...|$|R
5|$|Arabian horses also {{spread to}} the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully {{dominated}} the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|As unrest grew the 64th {{took place}} in an {{incident}} which lays a claim to the first blood of the American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> weapons and ammunition {{was known to be}} in Salem. The 64th, under their commander Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were ordered to seize the weapons. American patriots in Salem were forewarned and tried to prevent the 64th from carrying out their orders. In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E

5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E
5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> ready money to pay for more troops.|$|E

With a bombing party of 10 men, who voluntarily undertook this duty, he conveyed <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> 96 bombs to within 20 {{yards of the}} enemy's position over exceptionally dangerous ground, after the attempts of two other parties had failed. Lieutenant Smyth succeeded in taking the bombs to the desired position {{with the aid of}} two of his men (the other eight having been killed or wounded), and to effect his purpose he had to swim a stream, being exposed the whole time to howitzer, shrapnel, machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E

5|$|In June 1838 Barry {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain to locate <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London {{it proved to be}} problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found itself with <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, {{except for the}} propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E

Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E
