40|$|Flight {{experiment}} was designed primarily {{to determine the}} extent to which steady-state maneuvers influence characteristic vibration patterns measured at the input pinion and output <b>annulus</b> <b>gear</b> locations of the main transmission. If results were to indicate that maneuvers systematically influence vibration patterns, more extensive studies would be planned to explore the response surface. It was also designed to collect baseline data for comparison with experimental data to be recorded at a later date from test stands at Glenn Research Center. Finally, because this was the first vibration flight study on the Cobra aircraft, considerable energy was invested in developing an in-flight recording apparatus, as well as exploring acceleration mounting methods, and generally learning about the overall vibratory characteristics of the aircraft itself...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} Restricted Access. It was {{published}} in the journal, International Journal of Numerical Methods in Engineering [© John Wiley and Sons] and is available at: [URL] paper presents the development of a design algorithm for epicyclic gear systems. The criterion on which the design performance is assessed is the maximum tensile stress induced in the fillets of the sun, planet and <b>annulus</b> <b>gears.</b> From an initial set of prescribed real and integer design parameters the finite element method is used to determine the maximum tensile fillet stresses in each gear. An objective function is formulated to represent the total stress in the system by combining the maximum fillet stresses in each component. A sequential procedure is then used to minimize the objective function subject to equality, inequality and integer function constraints. The finite element method is used to evaluate the stresses in the gear teeth and iterative application of the analysis and optimization stages converges to produce a design vector such that the maximum stress produced in all components of the system is minimized. Since the effectiveness of each design is assessed using the finite element method, the factorized stiffness matrix is reused to calculate the design derivatives. This makes the processes very efficient in its use of computer resources...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} new method and device for continuously variable speed change management via compound epicyclic gearing with composite planet gears and closed circuit hydrosystem, when the speed control element is either outer ring <b>gear</b> (<b>annulus)</b> or the carrier or sun gear. In each case, the control element connected to closed circuit hydrosystem {{and can be}} in motion or immovable depending on the bandwidth of hydrosystem’s regulating throttle. We had held theoretical research and received graphic dependences between velocities of driving, control and driven elements by means of computer programing...|$|R
