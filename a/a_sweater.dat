According to the principal of Central, the two students had argued over ownership of <b>a</b> <b>sweater,</b> and the white student was assaulted.

Her remains were identified by a couple from Florida, who had allowed her to stay with them for a period of time. Nichols may have been murdered after leaving a truck stop along the highway and may have attempted to hitchhike.|$|E

25|$|Following Collins' arrest, {{a section}} of a red-and-white belt bearing the same {{distinctive}} floral pattern {{was found in the}} trailer he and Manuel had towed to Salinas on June 21. Moreover, <b>a</b> <b>sweater</b> found in Collins' closet was found to contain 22 pubic hairs which had not originated from Collins or any of the seven Michigan victims. At the request of Michigan authorities, Phillips' body was exhumed in Oregon in order that pubic hair samples could be obtained from her for comparison with those found upon Collins' sweater: The pubic hairs upon Collins' sweater proved to be a precise match to those obtained from Phillips' body, and investigators believe they may have transferred from her body to Collins' sweater as she was carried to the location in which her body was discarded. In addition, prior to his returning to Michigan, Collins is known to have visited a California hospital to receive treatment for poison oak anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|References to the Leafs in {{literature}} includes Foster Hewitt juvenile hockey novel, He Shoots, he scores!. Published in 1949, it featured {{the members of}} the team, including actual managers and players. In 1963, Scott Young wrote A Boy at the Leafs' Camp, a children's book giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the sport. In 1971, Young and George Robertson co-wrote an adult hockey-romance novel, Face-off, about the experiences of a star rookie player, Billy Duke, with the Leafs. The novel became a movie in 1971 with Art Hindle as Billy Duke. The film featured many of the players. Jim McKenny, body-doubled for Hindle for the on-ice action scenes because of his resemblance to Hindle. Owner Ballard had a part as the team doctor. In 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the short story The Hockey Sweater about a boy whose mother forces him to wear the hated the Maple Leafs sweater he has been given as a present, instead of <b>a</b> <b>sweater</b> for his beloved Montreal Canadiens. In 1980, the story was turned into an animated short by the National Film Board of Canada.|$|E

500|$|Female {{swimming}} {{was introduced}} at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Silent films such as The Water Nymph (1912) saw Mabel Normand in revealing attire, and this was followed by the daringly dressed Sennett Bathing Beauties (1915–1929).

The first annual bathing-suit day at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1916 was a landmark.
