5|$|The Alsos Mission was an {{organized}} effort {{by a team}} of United States military, scientific, and intelligence personnel to discover enemy scientific developments during World War II. Its chief focus was on the German nuclear energy project, but it also investigated both chemical <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> and the means to deliver them.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> {{programs}} {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

25|$|Several known {{deaths have}} been {{associated}} with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. Olson, a United States Army biochemist <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.|$|E

Professional publications in the field of international law, political science, military, medicine and others were used to achieve the objectives of the research.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the international regime of the prohibition of <b>biological</b> <b>weapons.</b> It theoretically delimits the regime by defining the terms international regime <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapon.</b> The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the effectivity of the international regime of the prohibition of <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> to delineate its presumable evolution in the future. The thesis presents the historical development {{and the use of}} <b>biological</b> <b>weapons,</b> their prohibition until the completion of the international regime of the prohibition of <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> in its narrowest form. It also focuses on the analysis of the normative pillars which support the narrowly defined regime. The pillars are the Geneva Protocol (1925) <b>and</b> the <b>Biological</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention. This thesis summarizes the most important events that occurred during the negotiations over the lifetime of the regime. It provides an assessment of the international regime of the prohibition of <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> based on the criteria of efficiency, which in this case is seen as the ability to enforce compliance with the regime, verify that it is respected and if not, as the ability to punish the violators. Given the current regime condition and the ongoing discussions relevant to the topic, the presumable evolution of the regime in the future is delineated. In conclusion, based on the chosen methodology, the international regime of the prohibition of <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> seems to be rather ineffective, however, in the future there may be an improvement...|$|R
25|$|Intelligence {{indicated}} that chemical <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> stocks {{may have been}} located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along {{the shore of the}} al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached - engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.|$|E

500|$|Many {{experts at}} the time, {{including}} Arthur Galston, opposed herbicidal warfare due to {{concerns about the}} side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions {{were introduced to the}} United Nations charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which regulated the use of chemical <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons.</b> The U.S. defeated most of the resolutions, arguing that Agent Orange was not a chemical or a biological weapon as it was considered a herbicide and a defoliant and it was used in effort to destroy plant crops and to deprive the enemy of concealment and not meant to target human beings. The U.S. delegation argued that a weapon, by definition, is any device used to injure, defeat, or destroy living beings, structures, or systems, and Agent Orange did not qualify under that definition. It also argued that if the U.S. were to be charged for using Agent Orange, then Britain and its Commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In 1969, Britain commented on the draft Resolution 2603 (XXIV): [...] "The evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by international law." ...|$|E
