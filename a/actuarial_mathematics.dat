This paper presents an unified approach {{so as to}} deal with minimax convex problems. In particular, we will yield a dual problem providing necessary and sufficient optimality conditions that easily apply in practice. Both, duals and optimality conditions are significantly simplified by using a new Mean Value Theorem. Important applications in risk analysis are given...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. S. M. Ulam, 1940, {{proposed}} the well-known Ulam stability problem and in 1941, {{the problem for}} linear mappings was solved by D. H. Hyers. D. G. Bourgin, 1951, also investigated the Ulam problem for additive mappings. P. M. Gruber, claimed, in 1978, {{that this kind of}} stability problem is of particular interest in probability theory {{and in the case of}} functional equations of different types. F. Skof, in 1981, was the first author to solve the Ulam problem for quadratic mappings. During the years 1982 - 1998, the author established the Hyers-Ulam stability for the Ulam problem for different mappings. In this paper we solve the Ulam stability problem by establishing an approximation of approximately quadratic mappings by quadratic mappings. Today there are applications in <b>actuarial</b> and financial <b>mathematics,</b> sociology and psychology, as well as in algebra and geometry...|$|R
40|$|International audienceQuantiles {{are basic}} tools in extreme-value theory in general, and in <b>actuarial</b> and {{financial}} <b>mathematics</b> in particular. The alternative class of expectiles {{has recently been}} receiving {{a lot of attention}} in actuarial science, econometrics and statistical finance. Both of these notions can be embedded in a more general class of M-quantiles by means of $L_p$ optimization. These generalized $L_p$ quantiles can in some sense, for $p$ between 1 and 2, interpolate between ordinary quantiles and expectiles. We investigate here their estimation from the perspective of extreme values in the class of heavy tailed distributions. We construct estimators of intermediate and extreme $L_p$ quantiles and establish their asymptotic normality in a dependence framework motivated by financial and actuarial applications. We also investigate the potential of extreme $L_p$ quantiles as a tool for estimating the usual quantiles and expectiles themselves. We show the usefulness of extreme $L_p$ quantiles and elaborate the choice of $p$ through applications to some simulated and financial real data...|$|R

40|$|We investigate, using questionnaires, {{the use of}} {{spreadsheet}} software in the financial sector workplace by recent graduates {{and the benefits of}} spreadsheets in the teaching and learning of <b>actuarial</b> and financial <b>mathematics</b> at postgraduate level. This study investigates the nexus between learning and work in order to modify the university curriculum. We aim to equip graduates with skills applicable in the workplace and to improve the learning of actuarial and financial theory. The results indicate that the use of spreadsheets in the workplace is ubiquitous and that graduates find them relatively easy to learn, easy to use and very useful for their work. Spreadsheet skills are considered very valuable. Little or no formal training had been provided during their university studies and graduates mostly learned on the job. The surveys of postgraduate students and of employers support the conclusions reached from the graduates’ survey. There is considerable justification for university courses to include training in the use of spreadsheets. 12 page(s...|$|R
