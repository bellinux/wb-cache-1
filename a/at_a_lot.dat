And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt.

500|$|The Documentary {{received}} generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, The Documentary {{received an}} aggregate score of 72 out of 100 based on 19 reviews. Pitchfork Media called it [...] "the best West Coast street-rap album since DJ Quik's 2002 LP Under tha Influence" [...] {{and described the}} production as [...] "a rich, triumphant sonic tapestry". Allmusic wrote the album was an [...] "excellent debut" [...] that [...] "hints <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of potential" [...] and observed the [...] "most remarkable aspect of the Game is how he can be such a blatant product of gangsta rap... and leave a mark so fast." [...] Rolling Stone noted The Game was [...] "going for emotional impact rather than dazzling wordplay or laughs" [...] and PopMatters described him as [...] "a self-conscious, malicious, nihilistic gangsta rapper with a heart and lyrical content". On the other hand, Robert Christgau believed the album was [...] "dull even when he isn't describing his medical problems, this no-talent is masscult rock at its most brazen". The A.V. Club praised the production for being [...] "a sonic classic of slow-rolling G-funk and glossy hyper-soul", but panned The Game for his name dropping, suggesting if he [...] "cut all the references to rappers and albums... it'd be a good 15 to 20 minutes shorter—and probably a lot more compelling." [...] Billboard declared it [...] "one of the best rap albums of the year" [...] and Entertainment Weekly suggested [...] "with the brightest hip-hop stars aligning for him, the Game may have willed himself a popular masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

He later moved to a house famous for its status {{as the site of}} the gruesome Tate murders, on July 4, 1992, and created a studio space there, calling it Le Pig. When asked about the building where production on the song was done, Reznor responded that he chose it merely for space considerations, claiming not to have been aware of the house's connection to the murders until after he chose it.

[...] She contacted John Waters, who gave her his blessing, then acquired the rights from New Line Cinema.

2500|$|Nine Inch Nails' second {{full-length}} album, The Downward Spiral, {{entered the}} Billboard 200 chart in 1994 at number two, and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America. To record the album, Reznor rented {{and moved into}} the 10050 Cielo Drive mansion, where the 1969 Manson Family murders took place. He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled {{on the front door}} in Sharon Tate's blood by her murderers. Reznor told Entertainment Weekly that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because he [...] "looked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most". He has also explained that he was fascinated by the house due to his interest in [...] "American folklore," [...] but has stated that he does not [...] "want to support serial-killer bullshit." ...|$|E

I showed [...] some references from the classic rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, but when you get into Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get into places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [...] There's less order and more chaos. So we looked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." [...] "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," [...] he said. [...] "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing.

2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw hat was a size too small. [...] "It was impossible {{to look at this}} vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of friends up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them.

2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers to mix and match them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. I wanted something with more flair and elegance. I remember looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of old Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E
