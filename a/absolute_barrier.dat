40|$|AbstractThis article {{builds on}} an action {{research}} process involving Ugandan smallholder farmers in collaborative experimentation {{on the use}} of human urine as a crop fertilizer. The aim is to explore farmers' perceptions and evaluation of the practice as a potential and partial solution to soil productivity problems. Findings show that urine fertilization is valued as a low-cost and low-risk practice contributing to significant yield increases, suggesting important contributions to food security and income, especially for those who have few options in soil nutrient management. Weaknesses identified by farmers relate mainly to limitations in collection and storage capacity rather than to inherent traits of the practice. In conclusion, urine fertilization should be acknowledged as a valuable strategy for supporting sustainable agricultural intensification. Furthermore, the importance of social norms and cultural perceptions should be recognized but not treated as <b>absolute</b> <b>barriers</b> to diffusion of the practice. Collective action, where groups of farmers jointly develop new procedures and adapt practices, serves as an important arena for social change and negotiation of norms and taboos, which can otherwise limit the acceptance and diffusion of alternative soil management practices.

40|$|Abstract Background Ecological {{processes}} {{are increasingly being}} viewed as an important mode of diversification in the marine environment, where the high dispersal potential of pelagic organisms, {{and a lack of}} <b>absolute</b> <b>barriers</b> to gene flow may limit the occurrence of allopatric speciation through vicariance. Here we focus on the potential role of ecological partitioning in the diversification of a widely distributed group of marine protists, the planktonic foraminifera. Sampling was conducted in the tropical Arabian Sea, during the southwest (summer) monsoon, when pronounced environmental conditions result in a strong disparity in temperature, salinity and productivity between distinct northern and southern water masses. Results We uncovered extensive genetic diversity within the Arabian Sea planktonic foraminifera, identifying 13 morphospecies, represented by 20 distinct SSU rRNA genetic types. Several morphospecies/genetic types displayed non-random biogeographical distributions, partitioning between the northern and southern water masses, giving a strong indication of independent ecological adaptations. Conclusions We propose sea-surface primary productivity as the main factor driving the geographical segregation of Arabian Sea planktonic foraminifera, during the SW monsoon, with variations in symbiotic associations possibly playing a role in the specific ecological adaptations observed. Our findings suggest that ecological partitioning could be contributing to the high levels of 'cryptic' genetic diversity observed within the planktonic foraminifera, and support the view that ecological processes may {{play a key role in}} the diversification of marine pelagic organisms. </p...|$|R
40|$|Questions on {{computing}} have fascinated mathematicians for centuries. Arguably, {{the most}} famous of these questions is the problem of computing the zeros of a polynomial. In particular, can one com-pute the zeros using only finitely many arithmetic operations and radicals of the coefficients? The negative answer to this problem for the quintic has had an enormous impact on the theory of com-putations, as mathematicians had to search for other approaches to compute zeros of polynomials. In particular one had to resort to approximations and then take limits. This was the birth of computational mathematics. This project addresses some of the fundamental barriers in the theory of computations. This is done via the concept of the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) [2] and towers of algorithms [1]. The SCI is the smallest number of limits needed in order to compute a desired quantity (spectra of operators, roots of polynomials, solutions to linear equations etc.). Intriguingly, several of the fundamental problems in computations have SCI greater than one (i. e., more than one limit is needed). While this may come as a surprise, this fact touches onto the fundamental boundaries of computational mathematics. In several cases (spectral problems, inverse problems) one can provide sharp results on the SCI, and it is therefore possible to establish the <b>absolute</b> <b>barriers</b> for what can be achieved computationally...|$|R

In mountainous areas, roads and trails may be particularly deserving of study because they are concentrated in the valley bottoms where they can impede animal movement both across and between valleys. In this study, we tracked wolf (Canis lupus) movement in the snow for two winters in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada to examine how wolves navigate through or around human-use features. We quantified the effects of human development and topography on the tortuosity of wolf paths and then tested the permeability of roads, trails, and a railway line to wolf movement by comparing the frequency with which actual wolf paths and a null model of random paths crossed these features. Wolf path tortuosity increased near high-use trails, within areas of high-trail and road density, near predation sites, and in rugged terrain. Wolves crossed all roads, trails, and the railway line 9. 7 % less often than expected, but avoided crossing high-use roads more than low-use trails.

The reactions of cells to single steps on a substratum were examined using time-lapse videorecording and scanning electron microscopy. BHK cells and chick embryonic neural cell processes exhibited gradual inhibition of crossing steps with a concomitant increase in alignment at steps dependent on increasing step height. Comparison of these cells' reactions, with those of chick heart fibroblasts and rabbit neutrophils, at a 5 fan step revealed that the influence of topography is also dependent on cell type, the neutrophils being relatively unaffected. The presence of an adhesive difference at {{a series of steps}} altered BHK cells' reactions such that the frequency of crossing was dependent on the direction of approach to a step. Although our data are consistent with Dunn & Heath's proposal (1976) that the inflexibility of the cytoskeleton of a moving cell's protrusion is the cellular property determining such reactions to topography, we have found that, on encountering a topographical feature, the response of a cell may be predictable on a probabilistic basis, i. e. the topographical feature reduces the probability of a cell making a successful protrusion and contact in a given direction, that even the largest features tested did not act as <b>absolute</b> <b>barriers</b> to cell locomotion since a small proportion of a population of cells were able to overcome them, and that other guidance cues could significantly alter a cell's response.

40|$|Marine organisms inhabit an {{environment}} where there are few <b>absolute</b> <b>barriers</b> to movement. In addition, a planktonic larval stage is common to most marine fishes and invertebrates. Consequently, marine organisms are often characterized by little genetic differentiation over large geographic distances, and the factors that might generally promote genetic divergence are not well understood. Here, contributions to population structure from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors were investigated in Gulf of California blennioid fishes. In Appendix A, population structure was estimated from mtDNA control region sequences for three species, Axoclinus nigricaudus, Malacoctenus hubbsi, and Ophioblennius steindachneri, that differ in predicted dispersal patterns (based on ichthyoplankton distribution and abundance patterns relative to rock reefs). FST ranged widely among low to high predicted dispersal species, in the same rank order predicted by larval distribution patterns. In A. nigricaudus (low predicted dispersal), phylogenetic, population genetic, and general linear model analyses of mtDNA (Appendix B) showed that variation was significantly partitioned between two biogeographic regions, and that geographic distance and unsuitable habitat also contributed to mtDNA differentiation. In contrast, allozyme variation in A. nigricaudus showed less partitioning than mtDNA {{and there was no}} break between biogeographic regions (Appendix C). In Gulf of California blennies, I find that population structure varies among fishes that have a planktonic larval stage in a manner that can be predicted from larval distribution patterns. The correlation between larval distribution and population structure suggests that some fish larvae, such as A. nigricaudus, actively maintain a position close to their natal reef, preventing substantial gene flow among many populations. In addition, patterns of population subdivision in A. nigricaudus (low dispersal) indicate that when dispersal is restricted, substantial population subdivision due to a combination of factors can occur, despite having a planktonic larval stage. The discordance between mtDNA and allozymes in A. nigricaudus is consistent with non-equilibrium conditions following a population perturbation, selection on allozymes or mtDNA, or some combination of these factors. These results emphasize that multiple genetic markers should be examined when making inferences about the genetic structures of natural populations...|$|R
