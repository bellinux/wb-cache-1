In this country the sum was about £44,000, and during 1909 about £1,800 had been paid here in pensions.

60|$|It is {{along that}} line that I feel {{a large part}} of our labour reorganisation, over and beyond that conscription, must {{ultimately}} go. The community as a whole would, I believe, get far more out of a man if he had such a comparatively brief passion of toil than if he worked, with occasional lapses into unemployment, drearily all his life. But at present, with our existing system of employment, one cannot arrange so comprehensive a treatment of a man's life. There is needed some State or quasi-public organisation which shall stand between the man and the employer, act as his banker and guarantor, and exact his proper price. Then, with his toil over, he would have an <b>adequate</b> <b>pension</b> and be free to do nothing or anything else as he chose. In a Socialistic order of society, where the State would also be largely the employer, such a method would be, of course, far more easily contrived.|$|E

6000|$|To lift up {{the man who}} {{has been}} {{stricken}} on the battlefield, restore him to the utmost of health and agility, give him an <b>adequate</b> <b>pension,</b> and re-equip him with an occupation suited to the forces left him--that is a process which does not cease till the sufferer fronts the future keen, hopeful, and secure. And such restoration is at least as much a matter of spirit as of body. Consider what it means to fall suddenly out of full vigour into the dark certainty that you can never have full strength again, though you live on twenty, forty, sixty years. The flag of your courage may well be down half-mast! Apathy--that creeping nerve disease--is soon your bed-fellow and the companion of your walks.

Then we shall teach him how to tread the road of it, so that he fits again into the national life, becomes once more a workman with pride in his work, a stake in the country, and the consciousness that, handicapped though he be, he runs the race level with his fellows, and is by that so much the better man than they.

40|$|The {{accentuation}} of {{the trend}} of demographic aging and the alarming deterioration of the economic dependency rate significantly affected the financial sustainability of the public pension system and {{stressed the need for}} a mixed system, public and private. Frank Fandenbrouke 1 declared, with justifiable concern, that we are not sufficiently aware of the unprecedented scale of these social changes that will press very hard in the balance our future in the next 20 - 30 years. In this context, reforming pension systems should consider two major objectives, namely: long-term financial viability of the systems and ensuring <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions</b> towards maintaining a reasonable retirement income to prevent poverty and social exclusion of older people. This explains the fact that over the last decade, a growing number of states, as part of reforms to improve the sustainability of pension systems, attempted to directly involve social partners and individual citizens in ensuring the pensions, by expanding the future role of the pre-funded systems, privately managed. The impact of the financial crisis on private pensions and financial constraints of the state have highlighted some shortcomings of pre...|$|R
40|$|The {{issues of}} old age, once {{neglected}} {{in terms of}} reflection and research on this period of life, in recent years took on another dimension.

Of particular interest are those aspects of life that have a direct impact on the sense of well-being of the elderly, namely: family, health, finances. The aspect of health is however considered mostly in the context of an overall psychophysical fitness, access to health care, <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions</b> enabling the purchase of medicines, rehabilitation, etc. In contrast, they less frequently deal with issues related to sexual attractiveness of the seniors and their erotic needs. Old age still does not go hand in hand with the sexual appeal. Elderly women are seen as unnecessary, invisible. They are not perceived as being able to evoke sexual desire. This social reception affects the senior women’s perception of themselves. In the eyes of a community an elderly woman may still be attractive intellectually, but not physically. Stereotypes built around the old age also assume that people in late adulthood have no sexual needs...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{cross-border}} portability of supplementary (occupational) pension rights for ED workers and self-employed {{has been discussed}} for more than fifteen years. The free movement of persons {{is one of the}} fundamental goals of the ED. Currently labour mobility is impeded by the lack of a clear framework protecting supplementary pension entitlements for workers and self-employed persons who move across different Member States for employment purposes. The challenge of providing enhanced social security and <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions,</b> in the light of demographic changes, further puts emphasis on the need for the ED working population {{to be able to move}} to different Member States for employment without being penalised, through reduced pension entitlements. The aim of this study is to identify the legal framework on portability of supplementary occupational pension rights for ED workers and self-employed persons who move or seek to move between the Member States for employment purposes. The examination of this framework is not limited to the analysis of actual legislative measures adopted at ED level, on safeguarding supplementary occupational pension rights for migrant workers and self-employed persons, but further tries to assess how this framework, and consequently cross-border portability of supplementary occupational pension rights, is being formed and could be further developed, and how, consequently, cross-border portability of relevant rights could be enhanced.

He {{played a key role in}} regulating relations between the wartime government, the coal owners, and the unions. His force of character and intellectual abilities were recognised by civil servants and ministers in the wartime coalition government, who used his enthusiasm and tactical finesse to great advantage to maximise coal production. In August 1946, Horner was elected General Secretary of the unified National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) into which the coalfield unions had merged. Horner’s reputation was such that he was in a commanding position to direct the union's strategy on the nationalisation of the industry and thereafter during the period of post-war reconstruction.This strategy linked a commitment to increased productivity to a series of demands set out in the 1946 Miners’ Charter. These included: a five-day working week without loss of pay; a guaranteed weekly wage average wage not to fall below that of any other sector of British industry; two weeks paid holiday; <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions</b> at the age of fifty five; modernisation at existing pits together with the sinking of new ones; adequate training for young people; new safety laws; proper compensation payments for industrial injury and disease; the construction of new towns and villages with good housing in mining areas.|$|R

40|$|As {{opposed to}} defined benefit pension schemes, which are showing {{sustainability}} problems around the world, individual capitalization systems {{are seen as}} financially solvent. However, {{there has been some}} controversy during the last years with respect to this system´s ability to provide <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions.</b> Nevertheless, in any contributory system, defined benefit or defined contribution, the performance of labor markets is crucial. The lack of contributions in the first case would imply financial problems (or exclusion) and lower pensions in the second. This article presents an analysis of how different variables affect the pension level in an individual capitalization scheme, assessing their relative importance. Then, individual level administrative data combined with survey information, is used to project pension benefits. The results show that a considerable percentage of the population {{would not be able to}} self-finance an old age pension higher than the level of the minimum pension guarantee, in expected terms. Moreover, most of them would not be entitled to get state funding to obtain a pension of that amount. However, the heterogeneity of individuals implies that there are very different situations and that not all of those who receive a low pension are vulnerable when old. There are cases in which individuals have other types of savings or, in the case of women; they might live of their husband´s pension or widow pension benefit if diseased. Additionally, two possible reforms are explored, and their potential impact is evaluated-the default contribution for self-employed and the extension of the minimum pension guarantee for a broader range of contribution periods, not just 20 years. pension schemes, individual capitalization, determinants on pensions level, Chile...|$|R

40|$|Multipillar {{pension reform}} {{is a global}} phenomenon. First {{implemented}} in Chile in 1981, multipillar reforms, involving the partial or full replacement of pay-as-you-go (PAYG) state pensions by systems of privately managed individual accounts, have spread rapidly in Latin America, Western Europe, and the post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The first instances of multipillar reform in Asia are now evident. This chapter puts these developments in perspective by comparing the current spread of multipillar reform with the earlier diffusion of first pension system adoptions between 1889 and 1994. This chapter will suggest that viewing this phenomenon as the diffusion of a new policy idea helps us better understand the global context of pension reform, {{as well as the}} reasons for and mechanisms of its spread.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the three tiers of pensions {{provision in the}} UK, and examines the shift in emphasis from public to private sector provision over the last twenty years. Up to the nineteen eighties {{the second and third}} tiers of pension support consisted of SERPS and defined benefit occupation schemes. The introduction of personal pensions in the late `eighties has eroded the importance of SERPS, and has illustrated that funded private sector schemes are viable as pension providers. The paper reports that eighty per cent of the working population has access to a second or third tier scheme, though whether this represents sufficient depth of coverage is more difficult to ascertain. In the case of occupational pensions, contribution rates are determined by actuaries.

40|$|The global {{economic}} recession {{has hit the}} U. K. service economy hard; less remarked on has been the recession’s effect on the British pension system.

The government, which in 2005 announced plans for a universal (citizen’s) state pension, has now shifted its focus to a new system of personal accounts to impel medium- and low-income workers without pensions to save for retirement. In this article, the author argues that only a system built on a universal pension in the “first pillar” can guarantee an <b>adequate</b> <b>pension</b> for all, especially part-time and/or temporary workers, carers, and those with interrupted careers. Many such women are workers, and many are in service-sector jobs.

40|$|How are hospitals, schools, GPs {{and social}} workers funded? How do the poor pay for their housing? • Is the tax payer {{prepared}} to pay <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions</b> to the growing numbers of old people? Will {{we all have to}} work longer? • Can western welfare states survive in an increasingly competitive world economy? These are some of the questions that the second edition of this best-selling textbook tries to answer. It begins by reviewing the range of ways in which basic human needs can be met and summarises in an accessible way the economic literature on why markets and even governments can fail in this respect. In a series of chapters "Understanding the finance of welfare" describes and assesses in detail the ways in which health care, personal social services, education, housing, pensions and social security are funded in the UK. In each case what happens in the UK is compared with the means used in other countries. Since demand always outruns supply, the book considers how these services are rationed and concludes by asking what future there is for the funding of western welfare states. Much has happened to the funding of social policy and the economy since the first edition of this book, especially in pensions and social care. New devolved assemblies have taken responsibility for setting social policy and their funding has become an issue. In response, much of the book has been revised and all the figures and tables have been updated. "Understanding the finance of welfare" has been designed to fit the needs of social policy student syllabuses where it has become an essential text. It is also important to students of public policy and economics and those training as teachers, medical students {{and social workers}}.

40|$|The current {{literature}} about old-age pensions can be characterised by the numerous analyses of pension system reforms {{in developed countries}} {{as well as in}} developing ones. Although the radical change in economic and social values during the process of transition from command economy to market economy offers many special cases for economists as well as social scientists, only some of them have analysed the developments of pension systems in Central and Eastern European countries. Therefore, {{the purpose of the present}} paper is to analyse the adjustments in publicly managed pillar as well the implementation of the funded component of pensions in Estonia, described by previous analyses in general as successful reforms in comparison with the other transition countries. Firstly, in the working paper the aims and the design of the pension system as well as main factors determining pension reform are studied on a theoretical basis. Next, the general overview of the reforms and more specific assessment of the changes in publicly managed scheme and the implementation of the funded scheme in Estonia are given. Finally, the challenges of the multi-pillar pension scheme in Estonia are described and in order to cope successfully with these challenges, some suggestions are made. The study explains that the undervaluation of the social dimension in comparison with the economic one has taken place during the transition period. The pension reform has to some extent ensured the financial sustainability of the pension system, but not fulfilled the two other objectives defined in 2001 by the European Council in Göteborg as a basis of sustainability of the pension system – to guarantee safe and <b>adequate</b> <b>pensions</b> and to respond to the changing needs of society and individuals. The present old-age pensioners (as well as the pensioners in the future) are directly placed at the risk of poverty and the opportunities of elderly people to participate in the societal life are very limited in comparison to the active population. The changes in publicly managed scheme as well as the implementation of the mandatory funded system (II pillar) and supplementary funded system (III pillar) during the period 1997 – 2002 have not been successful in avoiding potential demographic and macroeconomic risks in the near future. pension reform, transition economies, multi-pillar approach...|$|R

40|$|If {{the intent}} of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, was to assure that {{beneficiaries}} of insolvent pension plans receive <b>adequate</b> <b>pension</b> benefits, sharp increases in nominal rates of interest have blunted that purpose. Without an increase in these rates, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, the insurance agency established to guarantee benefits, faced large liabilities on the terminations of pension plans. We examine the economics of pension funds and the funding of pension funds before and after the enactment of ERISA. The Act changed the economics of pension funds. The PBGC, the employer, and the employees have interests in the assets of the pension plan. The PBGC can tax corporations to pay off liabilities and to fund guaranteed benefits; employers can terminate pension plans or overfund them; employees can ask for more benefits or claim the assets in the fund. Although the PBGC insures benefits, the insurance agent forbears, not acting quickly to protect its own interests. To prevent potential huge increases in its liabilities, the PBGC could require that employers hedge the guaranteed benefits, and fund their increases in promised benefits. Given its policies, these requirements could protect the PBGC. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} pension reforms under population ageing. The {{concepts of}} “implicit pension debt”, “implicit tax ” and “internal {{rate of return}} ” are first intro-duced {{with the help of}} a three-period model. Using stylised facts, ageing is traced to low fertility and increasing longevity. Formulating a benchmark for intergenerational fairness leads to a framework for designing pension reforms such that leaving an unfair burden to future generations is avoided. Secondly, a yearly simulation model is used to arrive at the following main results for reform blueprints: (1) In a Defined Benefit (DB) system, partial pre-funding is needed to achieve inter-generational fairness unless benefits are sufficiently reduced; partial privatisa-tion is an option for the management of the accumulating funds. (2) Transition from a DB to a Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) system is an-other reform option; it reduces the replacement rates to levels which match pre-scribed contribution rates; an NDC public pillar can be accompanied by a sec-ond pillar, managed by the private sector. (3) An effective increase in the retirement age is necessary to moderate the increase in pension expenditure and to preserve <b>adequate</b> <b>pension</b> levels. (4) Pension reforms have important effects on public finance target setting. (JEL H 1...|$|E

40|$|Icelandic {{women have}} {{through the years}} earned less {{occupational}} and supplemental pensions and depended more than men do on the basic pension of social security. Although women’s labour market participation has increased, the gender pay gap, unpaid labour in homes, and women’s fewer working hours in paid labour results in {{the extension of the}} labour market gender discrimination into old age. The structure of Icelandic pension funds is fundamentally male biased because of its tight connection to employment, despite the absence of direct discrimination factors.
