The large size of the tephra (up to 50 mum) requires rapid <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transfer</b> from the volcanic centers to East Antarctica.

40|$|The {{pathways}} {{leading to}} the volatilisation and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transfer</b> of selenium from oceanic environments are poorly understood.

In this paper we describe the results of experiments which provide a reasonable estimate of the global selenium budget. Gaseous selenium compounds were determined in the North Atlantic Ocean during a Spring bloom of phytoplankton species which are known to be a large source of atmospheric sulphur. The results demonstrate that significant concentrations of gaseous selenium species occur in surface ocean waters, and their production is closely linked to the gaseous sulphur species turnover. Selective uptake and biotransformation of dissolved selenium in seawater by phytoplankton is a major pathway for the production of gaseous selenium compounds in marine environments and their emission to the atmosphere. It is therefore suggested that such a major selenium source supplies the terrestrial environment with selenium that can be used as an essential nutrient for animal and human life...|$|E

The PAHs displayed a range of partitioning behaviors in the atmosphere from exclusively gas phase to exclusively particle bound, resulting in different modes of deposition to the plant surface. The different pasture species had different plant and sward characteristics, e. g., leaf morphologies, yields, etc. For the majority of PAHs, the plant species displayed a seasonality in concentrations, with concentrations being higher in the winter than in the summer. For the lighter PAHs, this seasonality was absent with soil outgassing and/or summer sources of PAHs being implicated. Air−plant transfer factors (scavenging coefficients, with units m 3 /g dw) typically ranged between 4 and 52 during the summer, increasing to 8 − 88 during winter. Despite different plant and sward characteristics, the mixtures and concentrations of PAHs were similar for all the plant species.

In this study, we first simulated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance using FluorMODgui 3. 1 and MODTRAN 5 code. Based on the simulated dataset, we analyzed the sensitivities of five potential Fs retrieval bands (Hα, K I, Fe, O 2 -A, and O 2 -B) to different <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transfer</b> parameters, including atmosphere profile, aerosol optical depth (AOD 550), vertical water vapor column (H 2 O), vertical ozone column (O 3), solar zenith angle (SZA), view zenith angle (VZA), relative azimuth angle (RAA) and elevation. The results demonstrate that the Hα, O 2 -A and O 2 -B bands are the most sensitive to these atmospheric parameters. However, only the O 2 -A and O 2 -B bands {{were found to be}} sensitive to the imaging geometric parameters. When the spectral resolution was sufficient, the K I and Fe bands proved to have the best potential for space-based Fs retrieval given the current available accuracies of atmospheric products, while the O 2 -A band was shown to perform better at lower spectral resolutions. The band sensitivity analysis presented here will be useful for band selection and atmospheric correction for space-based Fs retrieval...|$|E

Comparisons of simulated surface energy fluxes among models showed that the net radiation and surface temperature generally had the best agreement among the schemes. On an average (annual and monthly) basis, the estimated latent heat fluxes agreed (to within approximate estimation errors) with the latent heat fluxes derived from a radiosonde-based atmospheric budget method for {{slightly more than half}} of the schemes. The sensible heat fluxes had larger differences among the schemes than did the latent heat fluxes, and the model-simulated ground heat fluxes had large variations among the schemes. The spatial patterns of the model-computed net radiation and surface temperature were generally similar among the schemes, and appear reasonable and consistent with observations of related variables, such as surface air temperature. The spatial mean patterns of latent and sensible heat fluxes were less similar than for net radiation, and the spatial patterns of the ground heat flux vary greatly among the 16 schemes. Generally, there is less similarity among the models in the temporal (interannual) variability of surface fluxes and temperature than there is in the mean fields, even for schemes with similar mean fields...|$|E
40|$|Manuscript {{received}} in final form October 29, 2006) Abstract—In this work the theoretical {{relationship between the}} clear-sky outgoing infrared radiation and the surface upward radiative flux is explored by using a realistic finite semi-transparent atmospheric model. We show that the fundamental relationship between the optical depth and source function contains real boundary condition parameters. We also show that the radiative equilibrium is controlled by a special <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transfer</b> function and requires {{the continuity of the}} temperature at the ground surface. The long standing misinterpretation of the classic semi-infinite Eddington solution has been resolved. Compared to the semi-infinite model the finite semi-transparent model predicts much smaller ground surface temperature and a larger surface air temperature. The new equation proves that the classic solution significantly overestimates the sensitivity of greenhouse forcing to optical depth perturbations. In Earth-type atmospheres sustained planetary greenhouse effect with a stable ground surface temperature can only exist at a particular planetary average flux optical depth of 1. 841. Simulation results show that the Earth maintains a controlled greenhouse effect with a global average optical depth kept close to this critical value. The broadband radiative transfer in the clear Martian atmosphere follows different principle resulting in different analytical relationships among the fluxes. Applying the virial theorem to the radiative balance equation we present a coherent picture of the planetary greenhouse effect. Key-words: greenhouse effect, radiative equilibrium. 1...|$|E
