5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis {{without regard to the}} risks.|$|E

5|$|Practitioners of Falun Gong have {{launched}} {{a number of}} other campaigns to bring attention to the treatment of Falun Gong in China. Notable examples include the Human Rights Torch Relay, which toured to over 35 countries in 2007 and 2008 ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The relay was intended to draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> range of human rights issues in China in connection with the Olympics, especially those related to Falun Gong and Tibet, and received support from hundreds of elected officials, past Olympic medallists, human rights groups and other concerned organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} takes a brief detour as Martin and Rustin {{direct their}} <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> five-year-old missing-persons case, {{a little girl}} named Marie Fontenot, after she was mentioned {{by one of the}} locals. Authorities believe she is in the care of her father, and during a visit to see her uncle Danny Fontenot (Christopher Berry), his caretaker echoed their beliefs. Rustin searches the property for potential evidence, and while in a shed, stumbles upon a twig sculpture eerily similar to those discovered at the Dora Lange murder scene.|$|E
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E

5000|$|Declarative - {{this type}} of deictic gesture {{develops}} later than imperative gestures and directs <b>an</b> adult's <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> object or event to indicate its existence (the speech equivalent would be saying [...] "look at that"). Declarative pointing is expressive {{and can be used}} by the child <b>to</b> draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> interesting object and share this interest with another person. Declarative pointing can also be informative where the child is providing the other person with information. This type of gesture is typically absent in autistic children's gesture repertoires.|$|R

5|$|While the Chief and Cortana {{head to the}} Autumn, Alpha Base is evacuated. Silva {{decides to}} retake the Truth and Reconciliation and pilot the ship away {{in order to avoid}} being on Halo when the Autumn blows. The ship is taken successfully, but McKay realizes that Silva is blinded by the thought of {{promotion}} and glory to the danger of the Flood; if even one Flood specimen escaped containment on Earth, the entire planet could fall. Jenkins draws McKay's <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vital energy line on the ship, and realizing that the destruction of the Flood is more important than Silva's promotion, cuts the cable, sending the Truth and Reconciliation crashing into Halo, killing all aboard.|$|E
5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E
50|$|In music, a buzz {{single or}} advance single is a track or promotional song, {{released}} by the label (typically) preceding the album's release. The song(s) are released in order <b>to</b> bring <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> album's release. Buzz singles are not typically issued to radio as promotional singles, {{due to the fact}} that they are only intended <b>to</b> attract minor <b>attention</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regular single.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs {{alleged that the}} project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E

40|$|Often {{when there}} is no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> object, there is no {{conscious}} perception of it either, leading some to conclude that conscious perception is an attentional phenomenon. There is a well-known perceptual phenomenon—visuo-spatial crowding, in which objects are too closely packed for <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> single out one of them. This article argues that there is a variant of crowding—what I call ‘‘identity-crowding’’—in which one can consciously see a thing despite failure of <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it. This conclusion, together with new evidence that <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> object occurs in unconscious perception, suggests there may be a double dissociation between conscious perception of <b>an</b> object and <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> that object, constraining the extent to which consciousness can be constitutively attentional. The argument appeals <b>to</b> <b>a</b> comparison between the minimal resolution (or ‘‘grain’’) of object-attention and object-seeing. DOI: 10. 1002 /tht. 2...|$|R
