The company remained intensely private and, {{despite an}} active <b>advertising</b> <b>schedule,</b> wary of publicity. As Ben Dunne explained, in what the Times described as a rare interview in 1971, [...] "If there is one thing I hate it is publicity. No one is allowed to write about Ben Dunne. The people I do not like are the people who talk about what they have done and the people who talk about {{what they are going to}} do." [...] In that same interview, Dunne reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining family control of his business, saying: [...] "Public companies are like the government. The government has the privilege of spending money foolishly and public companies are no better." [...] Dunnes Stores concentrated instead on expanding its growing retail empire. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, the company had built up a network of more than 60 stores. It also had moved beyond the Republic of Ireland, adding its first stores in Northern Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Advertising is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of marketing and an important way for companies {{to raise awareness of}} goods and services in the marketplace. Advertising campaigns are designed to convey a marketing image or message to an audience of potential consumers and television commercials can be an effective way of transmitting these messages to a large audience. In order to meet the requirements for a typical advertising order, television content providers must provide advertisers with a predetermined number of "impressions" in the target demographic. However, because the number of impressions for a given program is not known a priori and because there are a limited number of time slots available for commercials, scheduling advertisements efficiently can be a challenging computational problem. In this case study, we compare a variety of methods for estimating future viewership patterns in a target demographic from past data. We also present a method for using those predictions to generate an optimal <b>advertising</b> <b>schedule</b> that satisfies campaign requirements while maximizing advertising revenue.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three essays {{that study}} {{the implications of}} online search activity for new-product marketing. Using the U. S. motion picture industry as a test case, the first essay examines the dynamic causal relationship between traditional media, consumers' media generation activity, media consumption activity, and market demand of movies. Consumers' media generation and consumption activities around movies are operationalized by the blog volume and search volume of those movies. I develop three separate models [...] a pre-launch period model, a post-launch period model, and an opening-week model [...] and {{examine the relationship between}} them separately for each period. As the focal variables are jointly determined, I introduce instruments and explain how to correct for endogeneity bias. I find that consumer searching activity is a key mediator between advertising, consumer blogging activity, and market demand. The second essay examines the pre-launch advertising effectiveness of new products using online search indexes as the response variable. I model the relationship between the <b>advertising</b> <b>schedule</b> and the online search volume process during the pre-launch period of movies. The model incorporates consumers' willingness-to-search and the time-varying effectiveness of advertising as key elements that influence online search volume at specific times. The model is represented in a Bayesian dynamic linear model framework and applied to the U. S. movie industry. The empirical analysis reveals important features of consumers' pre-launch interest development for new products. First, consumers' pre-launch responses to advertising are substantially influenced by the timing of advertising. Second, advertising effectiveness varies over time as a function of past advertising outlay. Third, the time-to-launch effect and time-varying advertising effectiveness vary substantially across movies. The estimation results are used to suggest a more effective pre-launch <b>advertising</b> <b>schedule.</b> The third essay provides an explanation of the varying predictive power of online search volume by examining the effects of consumers' quality perception on the search activity for and actual demand of new products. I hypothesize that both the perceived quality and quality uncertainty of a new product increase consumers' search activity for the new product, while only perceived quality positively influences the conversion of search activity into actual demand. Using the U. S. movie industry as a test case, I find that both perceived quality and quality uncertainty are positively associated with the pre-launch search volume of movies, whereas only perceived quality positively influences the conversion of pre-launch searches into opening-week revenue. Similar findings are maintained in the post-launch period analysis. These findings imply that systematic over-/under-prediction of market success may occur if managers use an online search index without considering the effects of quality and quality uncertainty of new products...|$|E

40|$|Ride-sharing schemes {{attempt to}} reduce road traffic by {{matching}} prospective passengers to drivers with spare seats in their cars. To be successful, such schemes require {{a critical mass of}} drivers and passengers. In current deployed implementations, the possible matches are based on heuristics, rather than real route times or distances. In some cases, the heuristics propose infeasible matches; in others, feasible matches are omitted. Poor ride matching is likely to deter participants from using the system. We develop a constraint-based model for acceptable ride matches which incorporates route plans and time windows. Through data analytics on a history of <b>advertised</b> <b>schedules</b> and agreed shared trips, we infer parameters for this model that account for 90 % of agreed trips. By applying the inferred model to the <b>advertised</b> <b>schedules,</b> we demonstrate that there is an imbalance between riders and passengers. We assess the potential benefits of persuading existing drivers to switch to becoming passengers if appropriate matches can be found, by solving the inferred model with and without switching.
