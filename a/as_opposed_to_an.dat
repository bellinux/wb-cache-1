5|$|Without the cost-sharing subsidies, the {{government}} estimated that premiums would increase by 20 percent to 30 percent for silver plans.

5|$|New backup oxygen {{generators}} and filters have been {{installed on the}} aircraft. The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the season}} — nearly two months earlier than the first storm {{formation}} in 2004 — a low-pressure area formed and persisted north of Honduras. Despite significant shear, the low managed to become Tropical Depression One on June 8 just north of Honduras. The depression began to head north towards western Cuba that day, but {{as it was a}} very large and poorly organized system under the influence of heavy shear, the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the official forecasts were highly accurate in predicting the storm's track. As the shear dropped, the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles (240km) east of the center. Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50mph (85km/h) winds. Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life, with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> inner convective core.|$|E
