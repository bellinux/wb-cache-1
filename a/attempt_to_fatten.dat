They then stage a musical number about the other horrible plans they have for him. Gabby, a sharpshooting cowboy, presents North with a souvenir from his act—a silver dollar with a bullet hole shot through its center—and advises him to move on.|$|E
25|$|The term ethical {{foie gras}} or humane foie gras {{is also used}} for gavage-based foie gras {{production}} that {{is more concerned with}} the animal's welfare (using rubber hoses rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment, as earlier <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> produce <b>fattened</b> livers without gavage have not produced satisfactory results.|$|R

50|$|Semi-intensive farming {{corresponds}} <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> of ovine, bovine, caprine, porcine. It is {{the most}} dominant, due mainly {{to the lack of}} space and the predominance of the fattening of livestock farrow.|$|R

50|$|After the Corps of Discovery, {{the next}} major event in the area was the arrival of Texas cattle coming <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> up on the local grass after their long cattle drives. The cattle drives lasted from 1866 until the late 1880s.|$|R

40|$|An {{existence}} and uniqueness result, up <b>to</b> <b>fattening,</b> for crystalline mean curvature flows with forcing and arbitrary (convex) mobilities, is proven. This {{is achieved by}} introducing a new notion of solution to the corresponding level set formulation. Such a solution satisfies the comparison principle and a stability property {{with respect to the}} approximation by suitably regularized problems. The results are valid in any dimension and for arbitrary, possibly unbounded, initial closed sets. The approach accounts for the possible presence of a time-dependent bounded forcing term, with spatial Lipschitz continuity. As a by-product of the analysis, the problem of the convergence of the Almgren-Taylor-Wang minimizing movements scheme to a unique (up <b>to</b> <b>fattening)</b> "flat flow" in the case of general, possibly crystalline, anisotropies is settled...|$|R

50|$|The {{farm was}} used for {{military}} parades during the First World War and as the site for victory celebrations in 1919. Before the Second World War, the Frusher family used the farm <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> pigs {{in the winter and}} as a popular recreation site in the summer.|$|R
40|$|Reports {{from several}} {{experiment}} stations have aroused {{much interest in}} the value of “steam processing” or “flaking” grain for beef cattle. During the process, some gelatinization or cooking of the grain occurs. This trial studied the addition of various amounts of completely gelatinized sorghum grain <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> steers rations...|$|R
50|$|Miles City {{was always}} a {{stopping}} point on the cattle drives from Texas, a place <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> the herd before market. In 1881 the Northern Pacific Railroad extended its line through the city, and in 1844 the Montana Stockgrowers Association was formed there making it a leading cattle market.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 {{the station}} was owned by the New South Wales based Harris family. A trial for wet season {{cropping}} {{on a large scale}} was conducted in 2010 with 480 ha of sorghum being planted. The crop in turn will be used <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> the cattle prior to export.|$|R
50|$|Tree {{species such}} as oak, hickory, and beech produce a hard mast—acorns, hickory nuts, and beechnuts.

40|$|Animal fats {{often are}} added {{in small amounts}} (1 - 2 %) to mixed {{commercial}} feeds primarily to reduce dustiness and to lubricate machinery. High-energy poultry rations often contain higher levels of animal fat. This test was conducted to obtain more information on fat’s value when added <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> lamb rations...|$|R

50|$|The {{opportunity}} came at last, when Porter took Palmyra. That the villains, with Porters assent, satiated their {{thirst for}} his blood by the deliberate and predetermined murder of their helpless victim no truly loyal man doubts. When they killed him, or how, or where, are {{items of the}} act not yet revealed to the public. Whether he was stabbed at midnight by the dagger of the assassin, or shot at midday by the rifle of the guerrilla; whether he was hung and his body hidden beneath the scanty soil of some oaken thicket, or left as food for hogs <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> upon, or whether, like the ill-fated Wheat, his throat was severed from ear to ear, and his body sunk beneath the wave, we know not. But that he was foully, carelessly murdered it is useless <b>to</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> deny.|$|R

50|$|Livestock {{speculation}} brought {{thousands of}} cattle {{to the open}} ranges in the late 1880s, the railroad was extended through the area, and Texas drove numerous cattle to Miles City <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> them on free grass and move them to {{where they could be}} loaded on trains bound for the slaughterhouses in Chicago.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} settlers in Fawkner was Michael Dowling and his family, who settled on their property at Major Road near Merri Creek in September 1902, grazing cattle <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> for market.
