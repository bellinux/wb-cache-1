2500|$|While {{the process}} is secret, the general method for making yeast extract on a {{commercial}} scale is to <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> to a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, {{which leads to the}} cells shrivelling up; this triggers [...] "autolysis", in which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are sieved out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free glutamic acids, which are analogous to monosodium glutamate.|$|E
2500|$|Jewitt {{describes}} {{in some detail}} the physical appearance, clothing and hats, jewellery, and face and body painting of the Nootka. He explains the household implements (baskets, bags), simple furniture (wooden boxes, tubs, trays) and food, describing it as constantly either feasting or fasting. Herring spawn, dried fish, clams, oysters, sea mammal blubber and [...] "train oil" [...] (whale oil) were staples of the diet (the oil was even added to strawberries). Venison and bear meat were eaten fresh, but fish was often fermented; a delicacy was salmon roe. Jewitt had metal cooking pots from the ship, but was forbidden from preparing his own food—Maquinna insisted that his captives lived and ate as the Nootka did (p.51), i.e. boiling and steaming their food (p.69). The Nootka did not eat salted food or <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> to anything, and Maquinna forbade his captives to make salt (p.51). Jewitt found a box of chocolate and a case of port wine (p.47) from the ship's stores, which gave him much comfort, as the Nootka did not like these delicacies, although they did appreciate molasses, rum, and other spirits. The men became completely intoxicated when they had access to alcohol, but the women drank only water (p.48), and Jewitt feared for his safety when his captors were drunk.|$|E

And added to the incurable dulness of the mess was the irksome feeling of being merely an overgrown schoolboy at the beck and call of every incompetent and foolish senior. Life was too short to waste in such solemn trifling, masquerading in a ridiculous costume which had to be left at home when any work was to be done. But he was young, with the world before him; there were many careers free to the man who had no fear of death.

But just those ties which every man may divide of his own free will are the most oppressive; they are unfelt, unseen, till suddenly they burn the wrists like fetters of fire, and the poor wretch who wears them has no power to help himself.|$|E

40|$|This study’s {{objective}} was to study how much the salt (NaCl) content of cooked sausage can be reduced without violating the perceived taste pleasantness. 34 assessors evaluated seven cooked sausages made with <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations of 1. 05; 1. 20; 1. 35; 1. 50; 1. 65; 1. 80 and 1. 95 %.

The saltiness and pleasantness intensity of different salt concentrations was rated against a reference sausage, which contained 1. 5 % <b>added</b> <b>salt.</b> A reference sample was also hidden among the samples. The assessors were able to rank sausages based on the saltiness into the right order.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of Hypertension {{as a major}} cardiovascular threat is increasing. The best known diet for hypertensives is 'no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> diet'. In this study we evaluated the effect of 'no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> diet' on a hypertensive population with high dietary sodium intake by measuring 24 hour urinary sodium excretion. Methods In this single center randomized study 80 patients (60 cases and 20 controls) not on any drug therapy for hypertension with mild to moderate hypertension were enrolled. 24 hour holter monitoring of BP and 24 hour urinary sodium excretion were measured before and after 6 weeks of 'no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> diet'. Results There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between age, weight, sex, Hyperlipidemia, family history of hypertension, mean systolic and diastolic BP during the day and at night and mean urinary sodium excretion in 24 hour urine of case and control groups. Seventy eight percent of all patients had moderate to high salt intake. After 6 week of 'no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> diet' systolic and diastolic BP significantly decreased during the day (mean decrease: 12. 1 / 6. 8 mmhg) and at night (mean decrease: 11. 1 / 5. 9 mmhg) which is statistically significant in comparison to control group (P 0. 001 and 0. 01). Urinary sodium excretion of 24 hour urine decreased by 37. 1 meq/d ± 39, 67 mg/dl in case group which is statistically significant in comparison to control group (p: 0. 001). Only 36 % of the patients, after no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> diet, reached the pretreatment goal of 24 hour urinary sodium excretion of below 100 meq/dl (P: 0. 001). Conclusion Despite modest effect on dietary sodium restriction, no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> diet significantly decreased systolic and diastolic BP and so it should be advised to every hypertensive patient.

40|$|Multiple {{exposures}} {{have been}} shown to increase preference for novel foods or flavours. This "mere exposure" effect is also well known anecdotally for changes in preference for tastants within foods, for example reducing sugar in tea or coffee. However, to date, this phenomenon has received little scientific attention. The present study addressed this issue in relation to changes in preference for salt within soup. Following an initial assessment of liking, familiarity and saltiness of six soups varying in salt content (0 - 337 mg NaCl/ml), thirty-seven participants, previously assessed for their preferred salt level in soup, were allocated to either an exposure group that received 20 ml soup samples with no <b>added</b> <b>salt,</b> to a group that received a 280 ml bowl of this soup, or to a control group that received 20 ml soup samples containing salt at 280 mg/ 100 g (within normal, commercial range). Soups were presented on eight occasions, at approximately daily intervals. The two groups receiving the no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> soup showed increases in liking starting at the third exposure, and also evident in a repeat assessment following the exposures. Increases in familiarity of the no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> soup were also evident during exposure. Rated saltiness of all soups increased as a function of exposure, so a change in saltiness perception could not account for changes in liking for just the no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> soups. These data suggest that simple exposure to the taste of the no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> soup was sufficient to increase liking to a level equivalent to the initially more preferred salt level...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a scaling {{argument}} to quantify the role of <b>added</b> electrolyte <b>salt</b> in affecting the stability and the morphology of preformed surface nanobubbles on hydrophobic substrates like the water-OTS-silicon or the water-HOPG interfaces. The <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> controls the electric double layer formation as well as affects the zeta (ζ) potential at the air-water and solid-water interfaces. The resulting electrostatic wetting tension acts in conjunction with the air-water surface tension (analogous to electrowetting scenarios), thereby affecting the nanobubble morphologies. Weak ζ potential of the water-HOPG interface or the water-OTS-silicon interface at acidic pH ensures that the <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> will have imperceptible effect on the corresponding preformed surface nanobubbles, validating the experimental observations. However, at alkaline buffer pH for the OTS-silicon substrate, under certain system conditions, salt-induced ζ potential can be substantially high so that the properties of preformed surface nanobubbles will be affected. This paper will thus readdress the long-held universal notion that <b>added</b> <b>salt,</b> no matter in what concentration, will not influence the properties of preformed surface nanobubble...|$|R
