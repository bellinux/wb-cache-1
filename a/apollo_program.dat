5|$|The <b>Apollo</b> <b>program,</b> {{or certain}} missions, have been dramatized in Apollo 13 (1995), Apollo 11 (1996), From the Earth to the Moon (1998), The Dish (2000), Space Race (2005), and Moonshot (2009).|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order {{to implement the}} <b>Apollo</b> <b>program</b> to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal {{by the end of}} the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program</b> by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E
5|$|Three {{adjacent}} {{parks in}} Fullerton, California, are each named for Grissom, Chaffee and White. The parks are located near a former Hughes Aircraft {{research and development}} facility.

He joined the Honeywell Corporation where he worked on the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program.</b> He and his wife Carol adopted two children, Scott and Sally.|$|E
5|$|Landing {{men on the}} Moon {{by the end of}} 1969 {{required}} the most sudden burst of technological creativity, and the largest commitment of resources ($24 billion) ever made by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program</b> employed 400,000 people and {{required the}} support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{budget has}} {{generally}} been approximately 1% {{of the federal budget}} from the early 1970s on, after briefly peaking at approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program.</b> Public perception of NASA's budget has differed significantly from reality; a 1997 poll indicated that most Americans responded that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Apollo</b> <b>program</b> also {{affected}} environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos {{taken by the}} astronauts. The most famous, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is The Blue Marble. This image, which was released during a surge in environmentalism, {{became a symbol of}} the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.|$|E
5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit {{the federal government to}} a program to land a man on the Moon {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which effectively launched the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the accident, NASA {{decided to}} give the flight the {{official}} designation of Apollo 1 and then skip to Apollo 4 for the first unmanned orbital test of the CSM, counting the two unmanned suborbital tests AS-201 and 202 {{as part of the}} sequence. The spacecraft problems were corrected, and the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program</b> carried on to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon successfully.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 17 was {{the last}} of the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program,</b> landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan {{commanded}} Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the <b>Apollo</b> <b>program,</b> Kraft retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning. In 1972, he became director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps of}} his mentor Robert R. Gilruth. He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in Mission Control.|$|E
50|$|The Lohner-Porsche's {{design was}} studied by Boeing and NASA {{to create the}} <b>Apollo</b> <b>program’s</b> Lunar Roving Vehicle.
