40|$|International audienceIn alpine and arctic ecosystems, the snowpack {{has been}} shown to {{insulate}} soils from the winter climatic harshness. Ongoing climate change modifies snowpack quantity and quality, but the consequences of these changes on the soil functioning remain largely unknown. We benefited from a subalpine landscape of the French Alps where, 700 years ago, agricultural practices {{led to the formation of}} terraces. Subsequently, on each terrace, snow thickness patterns significantly differed between the bank and the front areas inducing strong divergence in their soil microclimatic conditions. Using this framework, we measured <b>abundances</b> <b>and</b> activities of nitrifiers and denitrifiers, together with a set of environmental variables, on three grassland terraces between December and May to test the following hypotheses: (i) soil N-related microbial <b>abundances</b> <b>and</b> activities are sensitive to soil microclimatic variations and differ along the terrace snow depth gradient during winter, (ii) a thicker snowpack favors higher <b>abundances</b> <b>and</b> activities, and (iii) the driving forces for nitrification <b>and</b> denitrification <b>abundances</b> <b>and</b> activities vary along the snow depth gradient. Our results showed significantly and changing N-related microbial activities <b>and</b> <b>abundances</b> during winter despite partly frozen soils, and suggested the selection and/or adaptation of psychrophilic microbial communities. Moreover, activities as well as <b>abundances</b> of ni-trifiers <b>and</b> denitrifiers were significantly higher under a weak or absent snowpack during winter, and mostly related to soil water content and soil surface temperature according to our models. We suggest that strongly variable soil abiotic conditions at the front stations enabled the release of nutrients from soil organic and inorganic compounds favoring psychrophilic bacterial <b>abundances</b> <b>and</b> activities. Contrastingly, a thicker and permanent snowpack maintained circum-zero soil temperatures during winter which limited the microbial community's turnover and release of organic and inorganic N. This created N-limited conditions and N-competition between microbial populations resulting in lower <b>abundances</b> <b>and</b> activities. Overall, changes in the snowpack depth strongly affect the soil microbial functioning of subalpine grasslands with potential consequences on nutrient dynamic and other trophic levels...|$|R
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The <b>abundance</b> <b>and</b> importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the <b>abundance</b> <b>and</b> range of B.prionotes.|$|E

Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case.

5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton <b>abundance</b> <b>and</b> this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E

In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E
