5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he <b>always</b> <b>does</b> around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E

Charon <b>always</b> <b>does</b> things by the book and is extremely perceptive, {{despite the fact that}} his king always manages to sneak away undetected until it is too late. Charon is deeply concerned with the King's recent activities, especially as the King still has not chosen a queen and worries the King may die before this occurs.|$|E
25|$|Not unexpectedly, {{the idea}} came up in bureaucratic circles {{that it would be}} useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, {{including}} university professors. Not <b>always</b> <b>does</b> history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last Rites and died of a bronchial condition at 4a.m. on May 23, 1857.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition has a point over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has no particular reason to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E

25|$|Both Gold and Belle set off {{to search}} for Gideon's heart. Henry helps Emma escape from Gideon (knocking him out with a fire extinguisher) with Emma placing a {{protection}} spell to contain him temporarily. The others realize that Fiona has crafted the perfect trap: If Gideon kills Emma, Light will be destroyed. And if Emma kills Gideon, she will turn dark and Light will still be destroyed. Regina consoles Emma and encourages her to find another way like she <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> Emma attempts to hold off Gideon as Gold finds Gideon's heart. When Gold finds Gideon's heart he is tempted by {{a manifestation of the}} Darkness, which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart, Rumplestiltskin. The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he can finally have it all: power and love. The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him, that if Emma dies his Dark Magic will increase exponentially. After it's all over he can spend 100 years exploring the world with Belle, and spend the next 200 years destroying it. Gold resists and chooses {{to do the right thing}} and tries to use Gideon's heart to stop him from killing Emma. However Fiona's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon and instead Gideon's heart stops beating and dims. The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing and Gold heads out to Belle who consoles him for trying to do the right thing. Back at the intersection, Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves, protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost. Realizing what she must do, Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her releasing an enormous blast of light magic, ending the Final Battle.|$|E
25|$|During 1985, Den and Angie {{celebrate}} their seventeenth wedding anniversary {{but it soon}} becomes clear that their marriage is a sham. Behind the scenes of their great business partnership, {{there is not much}} of a relationship going on. Den has a posh mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), a fact that Angie is all too aware of. Early in the year, Den even manages to get on holiday to Spain with Jan, telling Angie that he is checking out a possible time-share holiday home purchase. With Den gone, Angie does what she <b>always</b> <b>does</b> in times of trouble, and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows. She also sets about trying to seduce the men of Walford in a bid to get back at her philandering husband. Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and even Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) are all subject to Angie's not-so-subtle flirting, but her only successful conquest is local builder, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). Tony falls for Angie, but she is only using him to get back at Den. The affair is conducted in secret, but they are caught in a passionate clinch in the middle of The Queen Vic by Sharon. Angie has to bribe her daughter to ensure her silence, and even informs her about Den's infidelity. Sharon is disgusted that both her parents are guilty of adultery. Upon Den's return from his holiday, Angie calls off the affair, but it isn't long before Sharon gives Den the impression that her mother has been up to no good. Den confronts Angie, and she admits to the affair, but unfortunately for her, Den isn't concerned about her infidelity, more about his reputation, which upsets Angie even more.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{depiction}} of Hindus caused controversy in India, {{and brought it}} {{to the attention of the}} country's censors, who placed a temporary ban on it. The {{depiction of}} the goddess Kali as a representative of the underworld and evil was met with much criticism, as she is almost exclusively depicted as a goddess of change and empowerment (Shakti), meaning that while she does destroy, she almost <b>always</b> <b>does</b> so in order to effect positive change. The depiction of Indian cuisine was also criticized, as dishes such as baby snakes, eyeball soup, beetles, and chilled monkey brains are not actual Indian foods. Shashi Tharoor has condemned the film and has criticised numerous parts of the film as offensive and factually inaccurate. Yvette Rosser has criticized the film for contributing to negative stereotypes of Indians in Western society, writing [...] " [...] seems to have been taken as a valid portrayal of India by many teachers, since a large number of students surveyed complained that teachers referred to the eating of monkey brains." ...|$|E

[...] It has received positive reviews from critics, and has been noted for its appeal to different age groups. James Poniewozik of the Time magazine described the titular character as [...] "the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, {{and he has a}} personality to matchconscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him." [...] On the other hand, The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said that the show [...] "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears.

500|$|Dale's {{characters}} {{on most of}} the American television shows he has appeared on have shared similar character traits, which Dale describes as the [...] "go-to powerful guy" [...] role. Following his appearance as Senator Eaton in The Killing in 2011, reviewers commented on his tendency to play powerful, wealthy and mysterious characters in many shows. Maureen Ryan of TV Squad wrote that it was [...] "lovely to see Alan Dale playing a typically Alan Dale-ian character. He's always so great at playing That Sketchy Wealthy Guy With a Hidden Agenda, which he has now played on, I believe, 87 different shows. And he <b>always</b> <b>does</b> it well." [...] Coincidentally, Dale's characters in Neighbours, The O.C. and Ugly Betty have all been killed off by a fatal heart attack. Christopher Rosen of The New York Observer wrote in 2008 that [...] "with his square jaw and seemingly no nonsense attitude, Mr. Dale is the go-to actor when casting directors need a conservative-looking authoritarian. When he comes onto the screen, audiences immediately take him seriously, since he radiates rich, smug and serious. He demands your respect." [...] Rosen says that Dale is [...] "not even...a particularly good actor" [...] but is [...] "fine enough" [...] and [...] "bring a no frills, no gimmicks style to his roles," [...] and [...] "manages to give a consistent performance in every show he appears on." ...|$|E

I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
