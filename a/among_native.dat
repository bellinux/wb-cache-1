5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.

5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} is a {{full contact}} outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team.

5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars <b>among</b> <b>Native</b> Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region.

On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined the boundaries of the region's tribes.|$|E

In line with previous research we find a higher incidence and a lower return to overeducation among immigrants indicating that immigrants lose more from being overeducated. We find a high degree of state dependence in overeducation both <b>among</b> <b>natives</b> and immigrants, but considerably higher among immigrants.|$|R

5|$|In many cultures, {{including}} in Europe, bats {{are associated with}} darkness, death, witchcraft, and malevolence. Because bats are mammals, yet can fly, they are liminal beings in many traditions. <b>Among</b> <b>Native</b> Americans such as the Creek, Cherokee and Apache, the bat is a trickster spirit. In Tanzania, a winged bat cryptid known as Popobawa, {{is believed to be}} a shapeshifting evil spirit that assaults and sodomises its victims. In Aztec mythology, bats symbolized the land of the dead, destruction, and decay. An East Nigerian tale tells that the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat, and now hides by day to avoid arrest.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those <b>among</b> <b>native</b> North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America <b>among</b> <b>Native</b> Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular <b>among</b> <b>native</b> audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low profit margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism <b>among</b> <b>Native</b> Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
30|$|Even {{if it is}} {{difficult}} to compare estimates across groups we can say something about the state dependence <b>among</b> <b>natives</b> as compared to immigrants. First, we note that the standard errors of the estimates are small which makes the 95 percent confidence interval rather narrow. As a result, the confidence intervals of the same estimate for the two groups are not overlapping making the estimates of the lagged dependent variable for natives and immigrants being significantly different from each other. It might thus seem reasonable to conclude that state dependence is a more severe problem among non-Western immigrants than <b>among</b> <b>natives</b> but that it is exists and is fairly large also for natives. The estimates for Western immigrants are between those for natives and non-Western immigrants.|$|R

5|$|The Native Americans {{played the}} first folk music {{in what is}} now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near {{universal}} <b>among</b> <b>Native</b> American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{credible}} {{descriptions of}} smallpox-like {{disease in the}} Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century AD. Smallpox was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1509, and into the mainland in 1520, when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico bringing smallpox with them. Smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was {{an important factor in}} the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards. Settlement of the east coast of North America in 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox <b>among</b> <b>Native</b> American populations, and subsequently among the native-born colonists. Case fatality rates during outbreaks in Native American populations were as high as 80–90%. Smallpox was introduced into Australia in 1789 and again in 1829. Although the disease was never endemic on the continent, it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs <b>among</b> <b>Native</b> Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E
