60|$|In short, Mr Blandois {{found that}} to pour port wine into the reticent Flintwinch was, not to open him but to shut him up. Moreover, {{he had the}} {{appearance}} of a perfect ability to go on all night; or, if occasion were, <b>all</b> <b>next</b> day and <b>all</b> <b>next</b> night; whereas Mr Blandois soon grew indistinctly conscious of swaggering too fiercely and boastfully.

60|$|All {{night and}} <b>all</b> <b>next</b> day the snow {{continued}} to fall; the next day, and the <b>next,</b> it kept <b>on.</b> Old folks down in Castleton said they never remembered such a storm.

For the first two days the wind had tried its best to keep the hills clear, but it had tired of the work, and for the last two had ceased to blow, and the great feathered flakes formed steadily and silently.|$|R

40|$|Dysfunction of the {{cardiovascular}} {{system is a}} common complication of chronic renal insufficiency. Many factors can cause left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and hyperten-sion and anemia are among them. They {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of LVH as well as in the development of cardiac dysfunction. Echocardiography enables early detection of functional macrocirculatory changes as well as adequate measuring of cardiac structures and LV mass. Anemia of end-stage chronic renal insufficiency (ESRD) is only one among its many complications and has complex pathogenesis; one of the primary factors causing anemia is insufficient production of erythropoietin, a leading factor in the production of erythropoiesis. Anemia correction with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in ESRD has a positive effect on {{the cardiovascular}} system. In this study the authors examined the hemodynamic effect of erythropoietin in anemic patients undergoing hemodialysis and observed its positive effect on the cardiovascular system. Twenty-two patients were included in the study (13 men and 9 women) mean age x= 39. 5 years. All patients were dialyzed three times a week for 4 hours and were <b>all</b> (continued <b>on</b> <b>next</b> page...|$|R
