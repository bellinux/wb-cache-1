5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Will's (Eric McCormack) apartment, Grace and Leo reveal to their friends, Will, Jack (Sean Hayes), and Karen (Megan Mullally), {{that they have}} gotten married. The friends' reactions to the news are not positive; in particular, Grace's gay best friend Will is uneasy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea. Leo and Grace, however, assure Will {{that they will have}} a wedding reception in honor of him, which improves Will's relationship with both Grace and Leo.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 2014, the Peruvian {{government}} announced that Van der Sloot would face extradition to the United States {{in the year}} 2038 to face charges of extortion and wire fraud, after completion of his 28-year sentence in Peru {{for the murder of}} Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez (see below). In February 2016, an undercover reporter filmed Van der Sloot confessing to Natalee Holloway's murder. The film shows Van der Sloot, in Dutch, laughing over how he never told the truth <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> event and that he did in fact kill Natalee. His Peruvian wife is also present during this conversation.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair. He was {{under pressure from}} the U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk felt that this was a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively {{accepting}} a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite {{that the two}} have only {{known each other for}} a short time. They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|When Nicola feels {{down about}} Simon moving on, {{she decides to}} seduce Ivan. He rebuffs her {{advances}} but she tells Lesley, Rodney and Laurel that she slept with Ivan. When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing. Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together and lets the whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right. When Ivan asks Paul for another chance, he turns him down and Ivan leaves the village. When he returns, Simon is annoyed with him for leaving him {{to pay the rent}} on Mulberry Cottage. He forgives him when Ivan reveals that he is just back for his job. He is made haulage manager for Matthew and Sadie's new business after they poach him. However, the job soon ends and along with Simon they leave Emmerdale for a new life in Costa Rica.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} was put off {{due to the}} varied national positions preventing a unanimous decision. Luxembourg fought to keep the ECSC or have compensation, France fought for Strasbourg and Italy, initially backing Paris, fought for any Italian city to thwart Luxembourg and Strasbourg. Meanwhile, Parliament passed a series of resolutions complaining <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> situation of spreading itself across three cities, though unable {{to do anything about}} it.|$|E
25|$|Early plans {{intended}} {{to name the}} new area 'Kahurangi', Māori for 'blue/precious jewel'. This has now been replaced with 'Wynyard Quarter', though it is still generally referred to as Tank Farm, including when talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Western Reclamation. Others have suggested the label 'Tech-Farm', referencing a 2004 call to showcase on the waterfront New Zealand's best sustainable design and technology, as well as anticipating the government's and council's 2012 initiative to establish an 'innovation precinct' within the Wynyard Quarter.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was completed}} on 27 February 1951 {{and it began}} taxiing trials on 2 March. On the following day it was taxiing at speed up to , but was blown off the runway when a strong crosswind caused the aircraft to bank which compressed the strut on the opposite side. This forced the aircraft to veer off the runway when the ailerons proved ineffective at countering the bank and the consequent damage forced the testing to be suspended. Some development was done to try to remedy the problems with instability already revealed, but Yakovlev was unenthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> project and it was cancelled in October 1951.|$|E
25|$|E. V. Ramasami (affectionately called Periyar by the Tamilians) {{came with}} his wife Nagamma {{and a group of}} {{followers}} and offered Satyagraha on 14 April. As the head of the Satyagraha, Periyar was imprisoned twice. Gandhi, who was also present on the Vaikom scene, was disturbed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair but seemingly unable to stop it. His concern grew when other religious groups became involved. Thus the Sikh community offered to meet expenses. Money was also said to have come in from Burma, Singapore, and Malaysia, from non-Brahmin immigrants, Muslims and Christians. Gandhi tried under the circumstances to keep the whole thing an intra-Hindu affair. However, in the end a compromise was reached. The streets in the temple area were opened to Harijans or Untouchables. In 1936, they were allowed to enter the temple. The Satyagraha paved the way for subsequent Temple Entry Act.|$|E

500|$|Coinciding {{with the}} counterculture's preoccupation with enlightenment, 1967 marked {{the period when}} LSD use had become {{widespread}} among rock musicians and their audience.

500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, because I thought it was special.

500|$|Anderson {{has also}} said [...] that [...] "the album was a spoof to the albums of Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, much {{like what the}} movie Airplane! had been to Airport" [...] and later remarked {{that it was a}} [...] "bit of a satire <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> concept of grand rock-based concept albums". Although Anderson wrote all the music and lyrics, he co-credited the writing to a fictional schoolboy named Gerald Bostock. The humour was subtle enough that some fans {{believed}} that Bostock was real. Reviewing the 40th anniversary reissue, Noel Murray suggested that many listeners of the original album [...] "missed the joke".|$|E
500|$|... "Pam came up {{with the}} title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> concept we {{immediately}} became inspired and began working on the music. You know, when we hear a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|The final was criticised by the media, {{with both}} teams {{receiving}} flak. Ken Jones of The Mirror wrote, [...] "Discipline {{was destroyed by}} tiredness, determination blunted by the pain of having to run some more. Behind the boredom was the failure of individuals like Leeds left winger Albert Johanneson and Liverpool left winger Peter Thompson, men who could and should have lifted the game with their talent." [...] The Times was slightly less critical of the match: [...] "In spite of much lateral 'method' play it was a tense battle of human qualities. The opening half, in particular, [...] was a quiet prelude. This was the careful shadow boxing {{that led up to}} a pulsating finish. Indeed, there was a certain hypnotic element <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing. The fascination lay in trying to assess which side would first break the stalemate." ...|$|E
