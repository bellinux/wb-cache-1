40|$|Meiotic {{chromosomes}} assemble characteristic "axial element" {{structures that}} are essential for fertility and provide the chromosomal context for meiotic recombination, synapsis and checkpoint signaling. Whether these meiotic processes are equally dependent on <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> integrity has remained unclear. Here, we investigated this question in S. cerevisiae using the putative condensin allele ycs 4 S. We show that the severe <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> assembly defects of this allele are explained by a linked mutation in the promoter of the major <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> gene RED 1 that reduces Red 1 protein levels to 20 - 25 % of wild type. Intriguingly, the Red 1 levels of ycs 4 S mutants support meiotic processes linked to axis integrity, including DNA double-strand break formation and deposition of the synapsis protein Zip 1, at levels that permit 70 % gamete survival. By contrast, the ability to elicit a meiotic checkpoint arrest is completely eliminated. This selective loss of checkpoint function {{is supported by a}} RED 1 dosage series and is associated with the loss of most of the cytologically detectable Red 1 from the <b>axial</b> <b>element.</b> Our results indicate separable roles for Red 1 in building the structural axis of meiotic chromosomes and mounting a sustained recombination checkpoint response...|$|R
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} meiosis in most sexually reproducing organisms is interhomolog recombination whereby a significant {{fraction of the}} programmed meiotic double-strand breaks are repaired using intact homologous non-sister chromatids rather than sister chromatids. Budding yeast DNA damage checkpoint kinases Mec 1 and Tel 1 act together with the <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> protein Red 1 to promote interhomolog recombination by phosphorylating another <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> protein Hop 1. Mec 1 and Tel 1 also phosphorylate cH 2 A and the synaptonemal complex protein Zip 1 independently of Red 1 to facilitate premeiotic DNA replication and to destabilize homology-independent centromere pairing, respectively. It has been unclear why Hop 1 phosphorylation is Red 1 -dependent. Here, we report that the pachytene checkpoint protein 2 (Pch 2) specifically prevents Red 1 -independent Hop 1 phosphorylation.

40|$|Meiotic {{chromosomes}} {{are highly}} compacted yet remain transcriptionally active. To understand how chromosome folding accommodates transcription, we investigated {{the assembly of}} the <b>axial</b> <b>element,</b> the proteinaceous structure that compacts meiotic chromosomes and promotes recombination and fertility. We found that the <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> proteins of budding yeast are flexibly anchored to chromatin by the ring-like cohesin complex. The ubiquitous presence of cohesin at sites of convergent transcription provides well-dispersed points for axis attachment and thus chromosome compaction. Axis protein enrichment at these sites directly correlates with the propensity for recombination initiation nearby. A separate modulating mechanism that requires the conserved axial-element component Hop 1 biases axis protein binding towards small chromosomes. Importantly, axis anchoring by cohesin is adjustable and readily displaced {{in the direction of}} transcription by the transcriptional machinery.

5000|$|Pliosaurus brachydeirus is {{the type}} species of the genus. It was first {{described}} and named by the English paleontologist Richard Owen in 1841, as a species of the wastebasket taxon Plesiosaurus in its own subgenus Pleiosaurus, creating Plesiosaurus (Pleiosaurus) brachydeirus. Later that year or in 1842, Owen published another study in which the species was relocated to its own genus, which he misspelled as Pliosaurus. As have been noted by several authors, Plesiosaurus (Pleiosaurus) is the original spelling of Pliosaurus, and therefore according to Article 32 of the ICZN, Pleiosaurus is the correct spelling of the generic name as well. However, because this spelling had been abandoned since Phillips (1871), Pliosaurus should be preserved according to Article 33.3.1 of the ICZN. The generic name is derived from πλειων, pleion, meaning [...] "more" [...] and σαυρος, sauros, meaning [...] "lizard" [...] in Ancient Greek, in reference to Owen' belief that Pliosaurus was {{more closely related to}} [...] "saurians" [...] (including crocodilians) than Plesiosaurus was. The etymology of the specific name was not specified, but it probably refers to the shorter teeth of P. brachydeirus compared to teeth of other species then referred to Plesiosaurus. The specific name has occasionally erroneously been spelled as brachydirus, for example by Richard Lydekker (1889a, 1889b). P. brachydeirus is known from the holotype which includes seven specimens found in association and housed at Oxford University Museum of Natural History, OUMNH J.9245, OUMNH J.9247 through OUMNH J.9301 and OUMNH J.10453.

Other specimens that are referable to this species include OUMNH J.9285, and OUMNH J.9192 through OUMNH J.9301, all described by Owen (1841-1842) and were found associated with the holotype. The specimens were collected by Prof. William Buckland at Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, from the Rasenia cymodoce ammonite zone of the lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation, dating to the early Kimmeridgian stage.|$|E
40|$|Unlike eutherian males, {{pairing of}} the sex {{chromosomes}} in marsupial males during the first meiotic prophase is not mediated by a synaptonemal complex. Instead, a specific structure, the dense plate, develops during pachytene between the sex chromosomes. We have investigated the development and structural, nature of this asynaptic association in males of the marsupial species Thylamys elegans by means of immunolabelling and electron microscopy techniques. Our {{results show that the}} behaviour of male marsupial sex chromosomes during first meiotic prophase is complex, involving modifications of their structure and/or composition. Pairing {{of the sex}} chromosomes and formation of the dense plate take place in mid pachytene, paralleling morphological changes in the sex chromosomal <b>axial</b> <b>elements.</b> Components of the central element of the synaptonemal complex were not found in the sex body, in agreement with ultrastructural studies that reported the absence of a canonical tripartite synaptonemal complex between male marsupial sex chromosomes. Interestingly, the dense plate is labelled with antibodies against the SCP 3 protein of the lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex. Moreover, as sex chromosome <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> decrease in mass throughout mid-late pachytene, the dense plate increases, suggesting that material moves from the <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> to the dense plate. Additionally, both sex chromosome <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> and the dense plate have proteins that are specifically phosphorylated, as revealed by their labelling with the MPM- 2 antibody, indicating that they undergo a chromosome-specific regulation process throughout first meiotic prophase. We propose that the unique modifications of the composition and structure of the <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> of the sex chromosomes in meiotic prophase may result in the proscription of synaptonemal complex formation between male marsupial sex chromosomes, where the dense plate is an extension of the <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> of sex chromosomes.

We compared the distribution of Atr signal in the fibrin-embedded spermatocytes with surface-spread preparations and immunohistochemically stained histological sections of seminiferous tubules. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridisation of the mouse minor satellite DNA was done on fibrin-embedded spermatocytes. The Atr signal is most conspicuous in fibrin-embedded nuclei on unpaired <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> during pachytene, both for sex chromosomal and for autosomal segments, and expanding from these elements into the surrounding chromatin.

Highlighting the unpaired <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> in the small heteromorphic 1 (13) H; 1 (13) Wa bivalent with an Atr signal enabled meiotic analysis of this bivalent to be carried out in a three-dimensional context.

40|$|During meiosis, <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> are {{generated}} by the condensation of sister chromatids along a protein core as precursors {{to the formation of}} the synaptonemal complex (SC). Functional <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> are essential for wild-type levels of recombination and proper reductional segregation at meiosis I. Genetic and cytological data suggest that three meiosis-specific genes, HOP 1, RED 1 and MEK 1, are involved in axial element formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HOP 1 and RED 1 encode structural components of <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> while MEK 1 encodes a putative protein kinase. Using a partially functional allele of MEK 1, new genetic interactions have been found between HOP 1, RED 1 and MEK 1. Overexpression of HOP 1 partially suppresses the spore inviability and recombination defects of mek 1 - 974; in contrast, overexpression of RED 1 exacerbates the mek 1 - 974 spore inviability. Co-overexpression of HOP 1 and RED 1 in mek 1 - 974 diploids alleviates the negative effect of overexpressing RED 1 alone. Red 1 p/Red 1 p as well as Hop 1 p/Red 1 p interactions have been reconstituted in two hybrid experiments.

40|$|Abstract Background The vast {{majority}} of oocytes formed in the fetal ovary do not survive beyond birth. Possible reasons for their loss include the elimination of non-viable genetic constitutions arising through meiosis, however, the precise relationship between meiotic stages and prenatal apoptosis of oocytes remains elusive. We studied oocytes in mouse fetal and neonatal ovaries, 14. 5 – 21 days post coitum, {{to examine the relationship}} between oocyte development and programmed cell death during meiotic prophase I. Results Microspreads of fetal and neonatal ovarian cells underwent immunocytochemistry for meiosis- and apoptosis-related markers. COR- 1 (meiosis-specific) highlighted <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> of the synaptonemal complex and allowed definitive identification of the stages of meiotic prophase I. Labelling for cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP- 1), an inactivated DNA repair protein, indicated apoptosis. The same oocytes were then labelled for DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) using TUNEL. 1960 oocytes produced analysable results. Oocytes at all stages of meiotic prophase I stained for cleaved PARP- 1 and/or TUNEL, or neither. Oocytes with fragmented (19. 8 %) or compressed (21. 2 %) <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> showed slight but significant differences in staining for cleaved PARP- 1 and TUNEL to those with intact elements. However, fragmentation of <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> alone was not a good indicator of cell demise. Cleaved PARP- 1 and TUNEL staining were not necessarily coincident, showing that TUNEL is not a reliable marker of apoptosis in oocytes. Conclusion Our data indicate that apoptosis can occur throughout meiotic prophase I in mouse fetal and early postnatal oocytes, with greatest incidence at the diplotene stage. Careful selection of appropriate markers for oocyte apoptosis is essential. </p...|$|E

Premeiotic pairing of homologous chromosomes was not detected in spermatogonia of the two species. FISH with centromere- and telomere- specific DNA probes in combination with immunostaining (IS) of synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins to testis sections of prepuberal mice at days 4 - 12 post partum was performed to study sequentially the meiotic pairing process. Movements of centromeres and then telomeres to the nuclear envelope, and of telomeres along the nuclear envelope leading to the formation of a chromosomal bouquet were detected during mouse prophase. At the bouquet stage, pairing of a mouse chromosome- 8 - specific probe was observed.

In most (but not all) organisms it is the establishment of sites marking such crossover-committed DSBs that facilitates completion of synapsis (full-length extension of the SC). The function of the mature full-length SC may involve both the completion of meiotic recombination at the DNA level and the exchange of the <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> of the two chromatids involved in the crossover. However, the demonstration that the sites of crossover formation are designated prior to SC formation, and the finding that these sites display interference, argues against a role of the mature SC in mediating the process of interference. Finally, in at least some organisms, modifications of the SC alone are sufficient to ensure meiotic chromosome segregation in the complete absence of meiotic recombination...|$|E
30|$|Cohesin complex {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for sister chromatid cohesion and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Cohesin proteins are also components of <b>axial</b> <b>elements</b> (AEs) and lateral elements (LEs) of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis. The cytological behavior of four cohesin proteins (SMC 1, SMC 3, SCC and REC 8 /SYN 1), assessed by immunofluorescence during prophase I in tomato microsporocyte revealed that the four cohesins are distributed unevenly and are not co-located along the AE/LEs in diplotene (Qiao et al. [2011]). Nevertheless, based on current models of the cohesin complex, these proteins must be present {{at the same time}} and place in equivalent amounts. These results indicate that cohesin proteins studied can form different complexes and/or perform additional functions during meiosis in plants.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSpo 76 p is conserved {{and related}} to the fungal {{proteins}} Pds 5 p and BIMD and the human AS 3 prostate proliferative shutoff-associated protein. Spo 76 p localizes to mitotic and meiotic chromosomes, except at metaphase(s) and anaphase(s). During meiotic prophase, Spo 76 p assembles into strong lines in correlation with <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> formation. As inferred from spo 76 - 1 mutant phenotypes, Spo 76 p is required for sister chromatid cohesiveness, chromosome axis morphogenesis, and chromatin condensation during critical transitions at mitotic prometaphase and meiotic midprophase. Spo 76 p is also required for meiotic interhomolog recombination, likely at postinitiation stage(s). We propose that a disruptive force coordinately promotes chromosomal axial compaction and destabilization of sister connections and that Spo 76 p restrains and channels {{the effects of this}} force into appropriate morphogenetic mitotic and meiotic outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Meiotic {{recombination}} in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSB) in chromosomal DNA. These DSB, {{which can be}} mapped in the rad 50 S mutant yeast strain, are caused by a topoisomerase II-like enzyme, the protein Spo 11. Evidence suggests that this protein {{is located in the}} <b>axial</b> <b>element</b> of the meiotic chromosome which implies that the DSB are located in these chromosomes {{in the vicinity of the}} bases of the DNA loops. We have found that in the yeast artificial chromosomes carrying human DNA, at the level of resolution obtained by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the meiotic DSB in the diploid yeast are co-localized with the DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) in a haploid strain of yeast. These HS are located close to sequences which, under stress, have the potential to form secondary structures containing unpaired nucleotides. Clusters of such sequences could be a hallmark of the bases of the chromatin loops...|$|R
