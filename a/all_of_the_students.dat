5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E

25|$|The first {{educational}} institution at Ernest Harmon AFB was {{an elementary school}} established in 1948 using a small clap-board building that housed 28 children and 3 teachers. The first high school graduating class (1957) matriculated in 1953 with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> beginning their educations at St. Stephens High School in Stephenville. A new elementary school was built near the base entrance in 1955 and was formally opened in May 1956 by former base commander, Colonel Richard Fellows and the school principal, Mr. Gerald Brennan. In 1956 there were 19 teachers and 62 children.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{striking}} regional variations in food security. Although food insecurity {{can be difficult}} to measure, 45% of elementary and secondary students in Maine qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch; by some measures Maine has been declared the most food-insecure of the New England states. Transportation challenges and distance are common barriers to families in rural areas who seek food assistance. Social stigma is another important consideration, and for children, sensitively administering in-school programs can make the difference between success and failure. For instance, when John Woods, co-founder of Full Plates, Full Potential, learned that embarrassed students were shying away from the free breakfasts being distributed at a school he was working with, he made arrangements to provide breakfast free of charge to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> there.|$|E
500|$|The animators {{needed to}} design {{completely}} new sets for the episode. Christian Roman, John Reiss, and Mike Anderson storyboarded the episode. In the original animatic, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II were not present, so the animators {{went back and}} added them, {{even though they are}} {{not a part of the}} story. It is a common misconception that Scorpio's design was modeled after Richard Branson, which it was not. The final design, which underwent an overhaul, was hailed by the writers as [...] "the perfect madman". <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> in Bart's remedial class were initially given hair modeled on Ralph Wiggum's, but the staff felt that the children looked [...] "kinda troubled", so their designs were altered.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a private}} high school in Ontario, in 2027. The player follows a new 11th-grade {{literature}} teacher at the school, John Rook, who has recently had his second divorce and is undergoing, in his words, a [...] "bizarre midlife crisis" [...] that has led him to quit his career in computers and become a teacher. The students in his class are Arianna Belle-Essai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal, Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> have school-issued computers, which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages. Rook, and therefore the player, can see all of the messages that the students send, even the private ones; the school administration has told Rook that it is for monitoring online bullying, and that he is not to let anyone know that he can see students' private messages.|$|E

Jacob stated “Having that extra time, having that extra cushion, is very…. It takes out {{just one of those}} stressors that testing gives you.” Casey agreed with Jacob saying, “The extra time was game changing for me. That’s what I needed. That’s the whole reason why I was in there [testing center] because I would find myself stressing about the time and breaking concentration from the test to look at the clock to make sure that I had enough time.” <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participant <b>students</b> who use <b>the</b> extended time test accommodation shared positive experiences and thoughts about <b>the</b> beneficial impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accommodation on their test outcomes.|$|R

500|$|On September 24, 2015, {{five people}} were killed and fifty were injured when an amphibious [...] "duck tour" [...] vehicle crashed into a charter bus on the bridge in an {{accident}} that also involved two smaller vehicles. According to a representative from the Chinese consulate, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were foreign-born. The students all attended North Seattle College, and {{were on their way to}} Safeco Field for new student orientation. One witness reported that it appeared as though the duck boat veered into the oncoming bus, after crossing the center line. Some blame for the accident was placed on the narrowness of the [...] bridge deck, which has [...] lanes, and the lack of a median barrier to separate the two directions of traffic. There have also been some calls to reduce the number of lanes in order to widen lanes, although early reports indicated that a mechanical failure of the duck tour vehicles' front axle may have also been a major factor in the crash.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{everyday}} quizzes {{and tests}} taken by students typically meet {{the definition of}} a standardized test: [...] everyone in the class takes the same test, at the same time, under the same circumstances, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> are graded by their teacher in the same way. [...] However, the term standardized test is most commonly used to refer to tests that are given to larger groups, such as a test taken by all adults who wish to acquire a license to have a particular kind of job, or by all students of a certain age.|$|E
2500|$|Seventy-two {{students}} were present for classes in January 1862 {{and the college}} functioned as best it could until a call by the Confederate government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers.

2500|$|Upon {{finding out}} {{that they are in}} a program and that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> are merely artificially {{constructed}} avatars, Hajime is then contacted by Makoto Naegi, the protagonist from the first game and now a member of the Future Foundation.

Alter Ego Junko's ultimate plan is to download herself into every person on the planet. Makoto tells Hajime that if the class votes not to graduate, it will allow him to reset the system and purge Alter Ego Junko. However, that also means that the student avatars will be deleted, along with all of the memories they gained while in the simulation.|$|E
