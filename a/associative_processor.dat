50|$|Because a CAM is {{designed}} to search its entire memory in a single operation, it is much faster than RAM in virtually all search applications. There are cost disadvantages to CAM however. Unlike a RAM chip, which has simple storage cells, each individual memory bit in a fully parallel CAM must have its own associated comparison circuit to detect a match between the stored bit and the input bit. Additionally, match outputs from each cell in the data word must be combined to yield a complete data word match signal. The additional circuitry increases the physical size of the CAM chip which increases manufacturing cost. The extra circuitry also increases power dissipation since every comparison circuit is active on every clock cycle. Consequently, CAM is only used in specialized applications where searching speed cannot be accomplished using a less costly method. One successful early implementation was a General Purpose <b>Associative</b> <b>Processor</b> IC and System.|$|E

40|$|Associative {{processing}} {{based on}} content-addressable memories {{has been argued}} to be the natural solution for non-numerical information processing applications. Unfortunately, the implementation requirements of these architectures u ing conventional electronic technology have been very cost prohibitive, and therefore <b>associative</b> <b>processors</b> have not been realized. Instead, software methods that emulate the behavior of associative processing have been promoted and mapped onto conven-tional ocation-addressable systems.

One such protein, bacteriorhodopsin (BR), is the light-activated proton pump that produces chemical energy for the archaeon, Halobacterium salinarum. In recent years, a branching reaction from the photocycle of BR has been discovered to produce a stable photoproduct, the Q state, using a sequential multiphoton process. The Q state has optical properties that enable the use of BR in bioelectronic technologies, however, the native protein has limited access to this photoproduct.
