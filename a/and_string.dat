5|$|Among Wood's {{other works}} was his Purcell Suite, {{incorporating}} themes from Purcell's stage works <b>and</b> <b>string</b> sonatas, which Wood performed at an orchestral festival in Zurich in 1921, and orchestral transcriptions {{of works by}} a range of composers from Albéniz to Vivaldi.|$|E
5|$|Feeder's {{music has}} been {{inspired}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists and styles, including The Police, Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins. The band's sound was radically changed from that of Rain Dancer on their debut release the Two Colours EP (1995), but has since introduced more acoustic aspects to their music, including elements of pianos <b>and</b> <b>string</b> orchestras.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, gravity {{becomes a}} fictitious force that arises in {{situations}} where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory <b>and</b> <b>string</b> theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other fundamental forces respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two primary}} {{alternatives}} for configuring this conversion equipment; centralised <b>and</b> <b>string</b> inverters, although {{in some cases}} individual, or micro-inverters are used. Single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel, and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard <b>and</b> <b>string</b> music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind <b>and</b> <b>string</b> sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{had been}} {{impressed}} in Leipzig {{with the concept}} of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from string quartet recitals, a rarity in London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, <b>and</b> <b>string</b> sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin's pupil, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch.|$|E
5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies <b>and</b> <b>string</b> arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Song of Innocence is an {{instrumental}} jazz fusion record that incorporates elements of classical, rock, funk, pop, and theatre music. It {{is arranged for}} bass, drums, <b>and</b> <b>string</b> instruments, written in the rock idiom with tempos centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used contrast in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album's euphoric psychedelic R form with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke their themes of innocence and spirituality.|$|E

5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass <b>and</b> <b>string</b> instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E
5|$|Homogenic is {{the third}} {{international}} solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of Homogenic was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats <b>and</b> <b>string</b> instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. Homogenic was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. Homogenic marked {{the first of several}} production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the Billboard 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

5|$|In a {{move that}} was {{described}} {{as an act of}} hurt pride by social historian David Smith, but also as a manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on Easter Monday 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould's honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president Sir John Llewellyn present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including David A. Thomas, were joined by a reed <b>and</b> <b>string</b> orchestra, the band of the Fourth Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, and galleries packed by members of the public.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} studio album by American hip hop {{producer}} and rapper Kanye West. It was recorded {{over the course of}} a year in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. The album features guest contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, Jay-Z, Brandy, and Nas, among others. Its production was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods <b>and</b> <b>string</b> orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the {{carriage}} barn is another building, also of brick {{but with a}} low hip roof. It is one story high, one bay deep and five bays wide. There are three sets of overhead doors on the main (south) facade of the building.

5|$|Shostakovich's {{works are}} broadly tonal {{and in the}} Romantic tradition, but with {{elements}} of atonality and chromaticism. In some of his later works (e.g., the Twelfth Quartet), he made use of tone rows. His output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies <b>and</b> <b>string</b> quartets, each totaling fifteen works. The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part. Among the most popular are the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies and the Eighth and Fifteenth Quartets. Other works include the operas Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, The Nose and the unfinished The Gamblers based on the comedy of Nikolai Gogol; six concertos (two each for piano, violin and cello); two piano trios; and a large quantity of film music.|$|E
5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, <b>and</b> <b>string</b> instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
5|$|The Soft Parade is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band the Doors, and was {{released}} on Elektra Records on July 18, 1969. Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Record producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors' first three albums: develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass <b>and</b> <b>string</b> arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer Jim Morrison, who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, leaving guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output. As a result, The Soft Parade is a somewhat uneven album that is less unified compared to previous works by the Doors.|$|E
