5|$|Despite its {{similarities}} {{however, the}} gameplay offered many new changes. Instead of collecting four Jet Pods, the player-character must rescue four MuuMuus in each level before exiting. Another new addition {{is the new}} interface, which displays one of Robbit's travelling AI companions, a health bar, a timer and a jump-meter that displays {{whether or not the}} player is eligible for a triple jump. Other new additions include the power orbs <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> power-up and the ability to obtain Performance Medals. A certain Performance Medal may be awarded depending on how the player completes a level. For example, playing through a single level without firing any weapons will reward the player with the Flower Child medal. There are a total of twelve medals to collect.|$|E
5|$|In late March 1889, {{just as the}} izinDuna {{were about}} to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the {{amalgamation}} with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession {{from a number of}} London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial adviser, and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.|$|E

5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to examine the types of materials to be used while handling the collection. If collection objects are to be moved, the use of flatbeds, carts, dollies, or pallet lifters may be warranted, with these objects being dubbed structurally sound prior to use. Tote pans or support trays are sometimes used for smaller objects, and liners such as polyethylene foam pads, quilted furniture pads, and acid-free tissue are commonly used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> layer of protection. When necessary, handlers may also don lab coats, safety glasses, dust masks, or respirators.|$|E
25|$|Some organizations, such as hospitals, {{often provide}} a single type of service, such as neonatal, while leaving others {{to provide the}} balance of services. How the service is {{actually}} provided, {{and the level of}} service that is provided, can vary from a region to another, although basic standards are quite the same. Emergency service in Italy is always free of charge. Air ambulance services are normally provided by the same regional authorities with a network of dedicated helicopters, or <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> service from a number of other government agencies, including the Italian Coast Guard, Civil Defence, and the Vigili del Fuoco (firefighters).|$|E
25|$|While penetrative rape {{generally}} {{does not}} involve {{the use of a}} condom, in some cases a condom is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission, both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of sex workers or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning {{and the use of the}} condom <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor.|$|E

25|$|Alexios {{appealed to}} Philip {{to help him}} and his father regain the Byzantine throne. Fortunately for Alexios IV, Phillip had good {{connections}} with the new leader of the Fourth Crusade, Boniface I of Montferrat (Theobald III, Count of Champagne had died in 1201). Therefore, when Alexios offered 500 Knights, 10,000 soldiers along with food and money to help the Crusaders with their drive to Egypt, Doge Dandolo and the other leaders of the Fourth Crusade happily accepted this new challenge. Both {{the money and the}} troops were desperately needed by the Crusaders as they had neither in the quantities they required- especially to pay of the Venetian debt of 34,000 silver marks. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> bonus, Alexios IV promised to submit the Byzantine Church to the Church of Rome.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{concerns}} over wooden construction, the Composites employed a number of vintage, turn-of-the-20th-century mechanisms {{to reduce the risk}} of fire. Most commonly, this involved the use of asbestos, electrobestos, or the asbestos containing material transite. Since the adverse health effects of such were not yet fully known nor understood, asbestos was present in numerous locations throughout the car, most notably under the floors, and around any electrical wiring. All of the undercar electrical equipment was housed in steel boxes. Steel and wood were used to complement each other and give rigidity to the body by strengthening the frame. However, the side paneling of the car remained wood. But <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> fireproofing measure, the wood siding would be encased in a layer of copper sheathing that ran halfway up the side of the car.|$|E
25|$|Heraclius later {{moved on}} to the Great Palace of Dastagird only to {{discover}} that Khosrau II had fled his Palace. In a fit of rage, Heraclius ordered that everything be burnt to the ground. Moving on, he soon found that Khosrau no longer commanded the loyalty of his subjects— as they refused to rally to defend Ctesiphon. Heraclius waited a week or two before marching his army back. Khosrau's son Siroes took power as Kavadh II and had his father shot to death with arrows. Later, the formation of a peace treaty favourable to the Byzantines led to the restoration of the pre-war boundaries. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> bonus, all captives and Christian relics that had been captured by the Persians were returned. Thus, it was {{at the head of the}} True Cross that Heraclius entered the Capital on September 14, 628 triumphant. Leading a procession which included four elephants, the True Cross was placed high atop the altar of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Ottomans {{considerably}} changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that {{only a short time}} had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, Süleyman who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained Mount Athos and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to Varna. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> bonus, Imperial authority was asserted over a number of Aegean Islands. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge.|$|E
25|$|Occlusal splints {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage splints {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>added</b> measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although it should be remembered that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E
