5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could {{reduce the number of}} faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all correct answers, and only the correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three answers being correct, and the team must select all of the correct answers, and only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order.|$|E
5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the {{original}} Mega Man. A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these first four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

25|$|The term Hispanic is {{cultural}} and not racial. The racial diversity found among Hispanics {{stems from the}} fact that Hispanic America has always been, since 1492, an area of immigration until late in the 20th century, when the region has increasingly become an area of emigration. Even outside the broad U.S. definition of Hispanic, the term encompasses a very racially and ethnically diverse population. While in the United States, Hispanics are often treated as a group apart from whites, blacks or other races, they actually include people who may identify with <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> those racial groups.|$|E

25|$|Dogs {{that develop}} the disease {{show signs of}} the illness within 3 to 7 days. The signs may include lethargy, vomiting, fever, and {{diarrhea}} (usually bloody). Generally, {{the first sign of}} CPV is lethargy. Secondary signs are loss of weight and appetite or diarrhea followed by vomiting. Diarrhea and vomiting result in dehydration that upsets the electrolyte balance and this may affect the dog critically. Secondary infections occur {{as a result of the}} weakened immune system. Because the normal intestinal lining is also compromised, blood and protein leak into the intestines leading to anemia and loss of protein, and endotoxins escaping into the bloodstream, causing endotoxemia. Dogs have a distinctive odor in the later stages of the infection. The white blood cell level falls, further weakening the dog. <b>Any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these factors can lead to shock and death.|$|E
25|$|Acarine {{ontogeny}} typically {{consists of}} an egg, a prelarval stage (often absent), a larval stage (hexapod except in Eriophyoidea which have only two pairs of legs), {{and a series of}} nymphal stages. <b>Any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these stages except the adult may be suppressed or occur only within the body of a previous stage. Larvae (and prelarvae) have a maximum of three pairs of legs (legs are often reduced to stubs or absent in prelarvae); legs IV are added at the first nymphal stage. Usually, a maximum of three nymphal stages are present and they are referred to in sequence as the protonymph, deutonymph, and tritonymph; however, some soft ticks have supernumerary nymphal stages. The females of some Tarsonemidae bear sexually mature young. If one or more nymphal stages are absent, then authors may disagree on which stages are present. Only the Oribatida pass through all developmental stages.|$|E
25|$|The triple {{combination}} Fire Engine or “TRIPLE” (as {{it is commonly}} called) {{is the most common}} type of firefighting apparatus in Los Angeles. The term “{{triple combination}}” refers to the apparatus having three components; water tank, high capacity water pump, and hose. The triple can be found as a one-piece engine company or as two engines assigned to a Task Force station. The “Triples” used by the LAFD have several parallel main pumps of varying capacities; 1,000 gpm, 1250 gpm, 1500 gpm,and 2000 gpm at 150 psi. Depending upon the area served, this apparatus may carry a combination of <b>any</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the following sizes of hose; 31/2″, 21/2″, 13/4″, 11/2″ and 1″. The water tank carrying capacity ranges from 300 gallons to 500 gallons. These apparatus are staffed by four members, including a Captain 1 as the company commander. A number of triples in the LAFD are also Paramedic assessment companies – meaning they include a Paramedic as part of the crew.|$|E
