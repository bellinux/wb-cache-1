5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Final {{against the}} Sydney Roosters was <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tense battle with neither club having much {{affection for the}} other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16-13. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much {{punishment}} and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons {{on and off the}} field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. Matt Utai scored two tries with Hazem El Masri also scoring. Willie Mason was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner. Stand-in captain Andrew Ryan, who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward Michael Crocker from scoring the final seconds of the match.|$|E

Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am.

Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show is <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E

500|$|Russell T Davies {{announced}} that Astrid Peth {{would be the}} next companion after Martha Jones (played by Freema Agyeman) on 14 August 2007. Astrid's surname, Peth, was confirmed in the Christmas edition of Radio Times. Davies has stated that the character was <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "one-off" [...] even before Minogue was cast and that Astrid would demonstrate [...] "a whole new take– again– on what a companion can be". The name Astrid Peth generated some speculation before the episode's broadcast over the findings that Astrid is an anagram of TARDIS, and that Peth means thing in Welsh. However, the episode established no such connection. On Doctor Who Confidential, Minogue describes Astrid as a [...] "dreamer" [...] and that meeting with the Doctor rekindles Astrid's desire to explore. Later in his book A Writer's Tale Davies discussed with co-author Benjamin Cook how he had originally named the character [...] "Peth" [...] in a treatment but it bugged him, he later renamed her to [...] "Astrid" [...] giving the reason that it [...] "...sounds more spacey, more like a futuristing [...] Doctor's companion".|$|E
500|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on November 17, 2010. Scheduled {{proceedings of}} the case met delays because of increased security at the courthouse. After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a [...] "miracle" [...] for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence. Gladys Weatherspoon, who had previously represented Guandique in the 2001 assault cases, stated that she was troubled by the jury's verdict: [...] "I just think {{they were going to}} convict anyway.... They felt bad for that woman, the mom. She's sitting in there every day."

The Eltonian framework considered the niche to be equivalent to a species position in a trophic web, or food chain, and in this respect there is <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vacant niche at the top predator level.
