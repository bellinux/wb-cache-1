5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} skewer two men simultaneously.

5|$|A {{formative}} {{experience for}} Ramsey {{during his first}} peacetime season was playing for Southampton against Manchester City in April 1947. Playing at full-back for City was the 38-year-old Sam Barkas, a former England international {{near the end of}} his last season. Ramsey was greatly impressed by Barkas's positional sense <b>and</b> <b>accurate</b> passing, and adopted him as a role model. The following season, 1947–48, Ramsey firmly established himself ahead of Ellerington in the Southampton team, and was the only player at the club to appear in all 42 League matches.|$|E

5|$|Alongside {{the iconic}} cowboy, gunfighters {{have become a}} {{cultural}} image of the American people abroad, and also as an idealized image of violence, frontier justice, and adventure.

5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart.

5|$|During {{a patrol}} on November 22, 1952, Loring was leading {{a flight of}} F-80 Shooting Stars of the 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron in {{an attack on a}} Chinese {{artillery}} position.

Rather than abort the mission, Loring continued his diving run, aiming his disabled aircraft at the position and obliterating it, killing himself in the process.

5|$|During this period, Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937. A defender, Miller initially played on the half-back flank before moving to full back during his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he lacked the strength to hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability <b>and</b> <b>accurate</b> kicking.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid <b>and</b> <b>accurate</b> diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E
5|$|Mayberry {{has been}} used {{predominantly}} as a starting outfielder, despite some suggesting he is better suited as a platoon player. He hits for power, but strikes out frequently.

Mayberry has a degree in political science from Stanford. His father, John Mayberry, Sr., played {{in the major leagues}} for over a decade and was a two-time All Star.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer. In 1937, he followed his brothers Les and Ray and joined the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). The VFA was the second tier of Australian rules football below the Victorian Football League (VFL). A defender, Miller played his first two seasons on the flanks; he was yet to reach his physical peak and lacked the power required to play in central defensive positions until his third season, in 1939. At this stage, {{he was unable to}} hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability <b>and</b> <b>accurate</b> kicking.Perry, p. 33.|$|E

5|$|To promote {{comfortable}} <b>and</b> <b>accurate</b> {{shooting from}} {{a standing position}} match air pistols must have fast lock times, shoot practically recoilless and vibration free and exhibit minimal movement and balance shifts during discharge.
