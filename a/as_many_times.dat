It has six arenas and two modes: Deathmatch, in which players attempt to kill their opponents <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as possible within a set amount of time; and Bounty, which focuses on collecting coins that injured characters drop. Multiplayer in Echoes features the same control scheme as the single-player mode, including the lock-on system for circle strafing while targeting.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} Hedges Used in the English Department Theses of Dian Nuswantoro University. It has two objectives. First, it aims at classifying {{the types of}} hedges used in English Department Theses of Dian Nuswantoro University. Second, it aims at describing the functions of hedges used in English Department theses of Dian Nuswantoro University. The method used in collecting the data was the documentation one. The data were taken from introduction sections of English students theses in Dian Nuswantoro University in academic years of 2010 to 2012. The steps {{to analyze the data}} are reading the data, identifying the types of hedges, calculating the relative frequency of each type of hedges to know which one of those types was mostly used in the thesis, classifying the types of hedges, and describing the function of hedges. The result shows that the types of hedges mostly used in those theses are modal auxiliary verbs <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 108 <b>times</b> (77, 69 %) that consist of modalities may, might, could, will, would, should and must. The other types of hedges belong to modal lexical verbs used <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 4 <b>times</b> (2, 87 %), adjectival, adverbial, and nominal modal phrase used <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 3 <b>times</b> (2, 15 %), aprroximators of degree, quantity, frequency, and <b>time</b> used <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 19 <b>times</b> (13, 66 %), if clause used <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 2 <b>times</b> (1, 43 %), and compound hedges used <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 3 <b>times</b> (2, 15 %). The functions of hedges found in the introductions of the thesis are function towards proposition and function towards the writer...|$|R

5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|From 1982, A, B, C, D, and E {{tickets were}} {{discontinued}} {{in favor of}} a pay-one-price admission system for Disneyland, allowing visitors to experience the park's attractions, including the DRR, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as desired. In June 1985, the new Videopolis Station, consisting of a covered platform with no station building, was built in the Fantasyland section for the DRR. That same year, the DRR's track on the northern edge of its route was expanded outwards in order {{to make room for the}} new Videopolis stage. With the Mickey's Toontown expansion of the park, Mickey's Toontown Depot, a cartoon-themed depot building, replaced Videopolis Station in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E
5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E
5|$|For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, {{walks and}} on-base percentage, tied his career high with 49 home runs, and even {{registered}} eight of his 19 career stolen bases, {{en route to}} winning his only Most Valuable Player Award. He led the AL in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, walks, and intentional walks and knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games. As of 2011, Killebrew's home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records, and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter. In the 1969 American League Championship Series, the Baltimore Orioles used their pitching staff, {{the best in the}} league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none. Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as they walked the rest of the Twins team.|$|E

5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E
