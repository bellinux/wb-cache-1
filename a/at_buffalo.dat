5|$|During the {{conflict}} over the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes <b>at</b> <b>Buffalo.</b> The canal, finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns.|$|E

5|$|The intense {{counterclockwise}} {{rotation of the}} low was made apparent by the changing wind directions around its center. In Buffalo, New York, morning northwest winds had shifted to northeast by noon and were blowing southeast by 5:00p.m., with the fastest gusts, 80mph (130km/h), occurring between 1:00p.m. and 2:00p.m. Just 180miles (290km) to the southwest, in Cleveland, winds remained northwest during the day, shifting to the west by 5:00p.m., and maintaining speeds of more than 50mph (80km/h).

5|$|The route follows Eighteen Mile Creek {{northwest}} and west toward {{the village of}} Hamburg, where the amount of development along the highway increases significantly. At McKinley Parkway (County Route204), NY391 becomes East Main Street and begins {{to pass through the}} outskirts of the village. It officially enters Hamburg upon intersecting Sunnyside Drive two blocks to the west. The route continues into the village center, passing by commercial and residential buildings on its way to a roundabout <b>at</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Street, where it meets US62. At this point, NY391 comes to an end while US62 turns west onto Main Street from Buffalo Street.|$|E

Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry (present-day Dixon, Illinois). The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and mail contractor John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Rothenberg's {{father had}} died and his mother, Lotte (1894–1990), had become a {{naturalized}} United States citizen. To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the international border into the United States <b>at</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955.

5|$|One block {{north of}} NY79, NY96 splits from NY13 and NY34 and {{heads to the}} west <b>at</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Street. NY89 begins here, and NY96 {{overlaps}} with NY89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NY13 and NY34, NY89 and NY96 run parallel to and a few feet {{to the north of}} NY79. NY89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY79. They do not intersect in this area—known locally as The Octopus—though they once did. At one time, NY96, NY79, NY89, NY13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NY13A and NY79 intersect there while the stub of former NY89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.|$|E
