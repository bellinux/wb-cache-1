40|$|The {{advent of}} {{computers}} in psychological and educational measurement {{has led to}} the need for algorithms for optimal <b>assembly</b> of <b>tests</b> from item banks. This paper reviews optimal <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> literature and introduces the contributions to this Special Issue. Four approaches to computerized <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> are discussed: heuristic-based <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> 0 - 1 linear programming, network-flow programming, and an optimal design approach. Ap-plications of these methods to a variety of problems are examined, including IRT-based <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> classical <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> assembling multiple <b>test</b> forms, item matching, observed-score equating, constrained adaptive testing, assembling tests with item sets, item bank design, and assembling tests with multiple traits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how mentally retarded persons accept or reject their disability by comparing perceptions that retarded individuals hold of themselves with their perceptions of persons labeled as mentally retarded. The study was also designed to compare perceptions that retarded individuals hold of themselves with their perceptions of persons with no disability label. Finally, the study was designed to compare perceptions that retarded individuals hold of persons labeled as mentally retarded with their perceptions of persons with no disability label. The subjects of this study were 48 males and 48 females from sheltered workshops in Arizona. All subjects were identified as mentally retarded by professional staff from the rehabilitation facilities and voluntarily participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of six experimental groups. In Group 1, subjects successfully performed an <b>assembly</b> <b>test</b> and evaluated themselves; in Group 2, subjects failed on the <b>assembly</b> <b>test</b> and evaluated themselves. Subjects in Group 3 evaluated a person labeled as mentally retarded after observing that person successfully complete the assembly test; subjects in Group 4 evaluated the same labeled person after observing that person fail on the <b>assembly</b> <b>test.</b> Members of Group 5 observed an unlabeled person succeed at the <b>assembly</b> <b>test</b> and evaluated that person, and members of Group 6 evaluated the same unlabeled person after observing that person fail on the <b>assembly</b> <b>test.</b> A factorial design varying target persons (self vs. person labeled as mentally retarded vs. person with no label) and performance outcomes (success vs. failure) on the <b>assembly</b> <b>test</b> was employed. The dependent variables were: (1) each subject's assessment of the cause of the target person's performance outcome as measured by the Causal Attribution Scale; (2) each subject's description of the target person as measured by the Semantic Differential and the Adjective Checklist; and, (3) each subject's expectations of the target person as measured by the Expectancy Questionnaire. Rank mean scores on each instrument were produced for the experimental groups and analyzed by Mann-Whitney U tests. In general, the results of the study indicated that mentally retarded persons do not perceive extensive differences between themselves and persons who are identified as being mentally retarded. Similarly, someone labeled as mentally retarded is not perceived in any more less favorable terms than a person who is not identified as being mentally retarded...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{automatically}} selecting items {{for inclusion in}} a test that has constraints on item content and statistical properties was applied to real data. Two tests were assembled by test specialists who assemble such tests on a routine basis. Using the same pool of items and the same constraints, the two tests were reassembled auto-matically. Test specialists {{not involved in the}} original manual <b>assembly</b> compared the <b>tests</b> constructed manually to the tests constructed automatically. The results indicated that the progress of automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> methods lies in improving item banking systems, classification schemes, and quality control measures, rather than in the development of different algorithms or in the improvement of computer time and cost. Index terms: heuristic algorithms, mathe-matical programming, <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> <b>test</b> construction, test design. The process of test construction is time consuming and expensive. Every year public and private testing organizations spend millions of dollars writing and editing items and then assembling these items into test forms for some measurement purpose. Until recently, the process of test construction or <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> has been virtually unassisted by modern psychometrics. A practical application of item response theory (IRT) suggested by Lord (1980) and Birnbaum (1968) is to use IRT in the <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> process. But the <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> process they suggested has little or no practical (as opposed to measurement) advantage over <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> methods using conventional statistics without additional assistance from computers. In the last 10 years, many <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> paradigms employing a combination of IRT, computers, and mathematical programming methods or heuristic methods have been proposed (e. g., Ackerman, 1989; Adema, 1988; Baker, Cohen, & Bar...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows how}} set {{covering}} with item sampling (SCIS) methods {{can be used}} in the analysis and preanalysis of linear programming models for <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> (LPTA). LPTA models can construct tests, fulfilling a set of constraints set by the test assembler. Sometimes, no solution to the LPTA model exists. The model is then said to be infeasible. Causes of infeasibility can be difficult to find. A method is proposed that constitutes a helpful tool for test assemblers to detect infeasibility beforehand and, in the case of infeasibility, give insight into its causes. This method is based on SCIS. Although SCIS can help to detect feasibility or infeasibility, its power lies in pinpointing causes of infeasibility such as irreducible infeasible sets of constraints. Methods to resolve infeasibility are also given, minimizing the model deviations. A simulation study is presented, offering a guide to test assemblers to analyze and solve infeasibility.
