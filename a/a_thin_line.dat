5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour out in <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, {{which was the}} point of sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces {{attempted}} to envelop the Pusan Perimeter. The 4th and 6th North Korean (NK) Infantry Divisions advanced south {{in a wide}} flanking maneuver. The two divisions were forced to spread their units along <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line,</b> but managed to penetrate the UN's left flank with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly pushing back US and South Korean forces. American forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance {{in a series of}} engagements in the southern section of the country. The 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, sustained massive casualties at Hadong in a coordinated ambush on July 27 that opened a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan area open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, the German Army in {{the east}} was the most {{powerful}} force in the region. Even more importantly, {{it was not only}} undefeated, it was victorious (in contrast to the German Army on the western front). However the commander of the German forces {{in the east}}, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties. He believed, rightly, that his army was the only stabilising influence over the Eastern Europe. Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former Oberkommando-Ostfront (or Ober-Ost) occupation zone became <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia. The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918. Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons en masse and returned home. Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength.|$|E

500|$|The Soviet Union was keen {{not to be}} left out. On 23 August 1936, {{it agreed}} to the Non-Intervention Agreement, and this was {{followed}} by a decree from Stalin banning exports of war material to Spain, thereby bringing the USSR into line with the Western Powers. Soviet foreign policy considered collective security against German fascism a priority [...] and the Comintern had agreed a similar approach in 1934. It walked <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> between pleasing France and not being seen to hinder the World revolution and communist ideals. This was also {{the time of the first}} significant trials of the Old Bolsheviks in Russia. Soviet press and opposition groups were entirely against non-intervention; Soviet actions could hardly have been further from the goal of spreading the revolution.|$|E

500|$|At {{the close}} of the day's fighting, Moreau's force stood in a {{precarious}} position. Left to right, the French were stretched along a jagged, broken line of about [...] Decaen's division stood at Riegel and Endingen, at the north-eastern corner of the Kaiserstuhl, no longer of any assistance to the bulk of Moreau's force; Moreau had also lost an energetic and promising officer in Beaupuy. On the right, Saint-Cyr's division stood behind Denzlingen, and the left stretched to Unterreute, <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> also separated from the center, at Nimburg (near Tenningen and Landeck), half way between Riegel and Unterreute. The French line faced north-east towards the Austrians; despite Habsburg successes throughout the day, the Coalition forces were unable to flank the French line, and the French consequently were able to withdraw in reasonably good order to the south.|$|E

In November, the band released an experimental album called Original Soundtracks 1, a collaboration with Brian Eno, who contributed as a full songwriting and performing partner. Due to his participation and the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker [...] "Passengers" [...] to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. Mullen said of the release: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> between interesting music and self-indulgence. We crossed it on the Passengers record." [...] It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally mixed reviews.

500|$|Marlo Campbell, {{a writer}} for Uptown, said that the play critiques {{masculine}} egotism and Western heroism through the character of Jason. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate disagreed, stating that Jason never lapses into self-importance. Aaron Krogman, who portrayed Jason and the pimp in the play's premiere, said, [...] "there is <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> between Jason and the pimp...both characters are struggling with power and how they use it." [...] Waldschmidt stated that the doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are Canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking and that it [...] "is not just somebody else's problem over there...but that it's us, and it's in our country and in our backyard and in our suburbs". Jason has in this way been considered an everyman. Chris Quandt, who portrayed Jason at the United States premiere, {{said that he and}} his fellow cast members greatly appreciated the fact that Kooman incorporated into the play the facts that taking down one brothel often leaves space for another brothel to be established soon afterwards, and that child sex tourism exists because there is a demand for it.|$|E
500|$|The Great Naktong Offensive {{was one of}} {{the most}} brutal fights of the Korean War. The five-prong {{offensive}} led to heavy fighting around Haman, Kyongju, Naktong Bulge, Nam River, Yongsan, Tabu-Dong and Ka-san. The North Korean attacks made appreciable gains and forced the UN troops along the Pusan Perimeter to form <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> of defense, relying on mobile reserves for the strength to push back North Korean attackers. From September 18 this fighting was intense and the battle was a very costly deadlock for the two overextended armies. The North Koreans were initially successful in breaking through UN lines in multiple places and made substantial gains in surrounding and pushing back UN units. On September 4–5 the situation was so dire for the UN troops that the US Eighth Army and ROK Army moved their headquarters elements from Taegu to Pusan to prevent them from being overrun, though Walker remained in Taegu with a small forward detachment. They also prepared their logistics systems for a retreat to a smaller defensive perimeter called the [...] "Davidson Line." [...] By September 6, however, Walker decided another retreat would not be necessary.|$|E
500|$|The {{armies of}} the First Coalition {{included}} the contingents and the infantry and cavalry {{of the various}} states, amounted to about 125,000 troops (including the three autonomous corps), a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force {{by the standards of}} the Revolutionary wars. Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and brother of the Holy Roman Emperor, served as commander-in-chief. In total, Charles’ troops stretched in a line from Switzerland to the North Sea. Habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from Basel to Frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of the opposition. [...] Compared to French coverage, Charles had half the number of troops covering a 211-mile front, stretching from Renchen, near Basel to Bingen. Furthermore, he had concentrated the bulk of his force, commanded by Count Baillet Latour, between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely, as it offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. To the north, Wilhelm von Wartensleben’s autonomous corps stretched in <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> between Mainz and Giessen.|$|E
