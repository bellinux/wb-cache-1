40|$|Abstract — SRA is {{a web-based}} tool that {{performs}} Spectral and Roughness Analysis on user-submitted sound files (. wav and. <b>aif</b> <b>formats).</b> Spectral analysis incorporates an improved Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm [1 - 2] and automates spectral peak-picking using Loris opensource C++ class library components. Users can set three spectral analysis/peak-picking parameters: analysis bandwidth, spectral-amplitude normalization, and spectralamplitude threshold. These {{are described in}} detail within the tool, including suggestions on settings appropriate to the submitted files and research questions of interest. The spectral values obtained from the analysis enter a roughness calculation model [3 - 4], outputting roughness values at userspecified points within a file or roughness profiles at userspecified time intervals. The tool offers research background on spectral analysis, auditory roughness, and the algorithms used, including links to relevant publications. Spectral and roughness analysis of sound signals finds applications in music cognition, musical analysis, speech processing, and music teaching research, {{as well as in}} medicine and other areas. Presentation of the spectral analysis technique, the roughness estimation model, and the online tool is followed by a discussion of research studies employing the tool and an outline of future possible applications.

This paper {{reports on}} some prelimary {{research}} into how software tools like InterLoc {{can be used}} as an interface to the World Wide Argument Web (WWAW) and how the WWAW in return can provide a useful resource to agents acting within InterLoc. Two persuasive dialogue games, the human-oriented Critical Reasoning Game (CRG) from InterLoc and the philosophy-based agent-oriented game for permissive persuasion named PPD 0 are compared using the Dialogue Game Description Language (DGDL) as an interlingua. The expressiveness of each game is investigated by mapping output dialogues onto argumentation structures represented in the Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF).</b> ...|$|R

We use the RDF Schema (RDFS) ontology language to specify the ontology of the recently proposed Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF)</b> and an extension thereof to Toulmin’s argument scheme. We build a prototype Web-based system for demonstrating basic querying for argument structures expressed in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). An RDF repository is created using the Sesame open source RDF server, and can be accessed via a user interface that implements various user-defined queries. ...|$|R

In order to support such interchange, an abstract ontology for argumentation is presented, which serves as an interlingua between various more concrete argumentation languages. In this article, we aim to give what is essentially a logical specification of the AIF ontology by mapping the ontology onto the logical ASPIC(+) framework for argumentation. We thus lay foundations for interrelating formal logic-based approaches to argumentation captured by the ASPIC(+) framework and the wider class of argumentation languages, including those that are more informal and user-orientated. ...|$|R

In its current form, this document {{is intended to be}} a strawman model which serves as a point of discussion for the community rather than an attempt at a definitive, all encompassing model. The hope is that it could provide a useful input to ArgMAS discussion in paricular on the utility of common Argumentation Interchange Formats, what form they might take and a potential research / development agenda to help realise them. ...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{arguments}} {{on the social}} web is a key challenge for those studying computational argumentation. This is because formal models of argumentation tend to assume dialectic and logical argument, whereas argumentation on the social web is highly eristic. In this paper we explore this gap by bringing together the Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF)</b> and the Semantic Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC) project, and modelling a sample of social web arguments. This allows us to explore which eristic effects cannot be modelled, and also to see which features of the social web are missing. We show that even in our small sample, from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, eristic effects (such as playing to the audience) were missing from the final model, and that key social features (such as likes and dislikes) were also not represented. This suggests that both eristic and social extensions {{need to be made}} to our models of argumentation in order to deal effectively with the social we...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, {{little work}} has been {{dedicated}} to the representation and interchange of informal, semistructured arguments of the type found in natural language prose and dialogue. To redress this, the research community recently initiated work towards an Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF).</b> The AIF aims to facilitate the exchange of semi-structured arguments among different argument analysis and argumentation-support tools. In this paper, we present a Description Logic ontology for annotating arguments, based on a new reification of the AIF and founded in Walton’s theory of argumentation schemes. We demonstrate how this ontology enables {{a new kind of}} automated reasoning over argument structures, which complements classical reasoning about argument acceptability. In particular, Web Ontology Language reasoning enables significantly enhanced querying of arguments through automatic scheme classifications, instance classification, inference of indirect support in chained argument structures, and inference of critical questions. We present the implementation of a pilot Web-based system for authoring and querying argument structures using the proposed ontology. ...|$|R

ArgDF comprises a set of tools such as the integration of a variety of argumentation schemes with the possibility of adding new schemes from the user interface. Another feature is to attack and support existing ex-pressions in ArgDF, or to use existing statements in new arguments, leading to the possibility of building a set of interlinked arguments networks.

40|$|Abstract. Abstract {{argument}} frameworks {{have been}} used for various applications within multi-agent systems, including reasoning and negotiation. Different argument frameworks make use of different inter-argument relations and semantics to identify some subset of arguments as coherent, yet there is no easy way to map between these frameworks; most commonly, this is done manually according to human intuition. In response, in this paper, we show how a set of arguments described using Dung’s or Nielsen’s argument frameworks can be mapped from and to an argument framework that includes both attack and support relations. This mapping preserves the framework’s semantics in the sense that an argument deemed coherent in one framework is coherent in the other under a related semantics. Interestingly, this translation is not unique, with one set of arguments in the support based framework mapping to multiple argument sets within the attack only framework. Additionally, we show how EAF can be mapped into a subset of the argument interchange <b>format</b> (<b>AIF).</b> By using this mapping, any other argument framework using this subset of AIF can be translated into a DAF while preserving its semantics...|$|R
40|$|Modeling DSP {{applications}} through coarse-grain dataflow graphs {{is popular}} in the DSP design community, and a growing set of rapid prototyping tools support such dataflow semantics. Since different tools may be suitable for different phases or generations of a design, it is often desirable to migrate a dataflow-based application model from one prototyping tool to another. Two critical problems in transferring dataflow-based designs across different prototyping tools are {{the lack of a}} vendor-independent language for DSP-oriented dataflow graphs, and the lack of an efficient porting methodology. In our previous work, the dataflow interchange format (DIF) [5] has been developed as a standard language to specify mixed-grain dataflow models for DSP systems. This paper presents the augmentation of the DIF infrastructure with a systematic porting approach that integrates DIF tightly with the specific exporting and importing mechanisms that interface DIF to specific DSP design tools. In conjunction with this porting mechanism, this paper also introduces a novel language, called the actor interchange <b>format</b> (<b>AIF),</b> for transferring relevant information pertaining to DSP library components across different tools. Through a case study of a synthetic aperture radar application, we demonstrate the high degree of automation offered by our DIF-based porting approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The pragma-dialectical ideal {{model of}} a {{critical}} discussion takes a normative approach to argumentative discourse. The model defines the four stages of a critical discussion, conditions on speech acts and their distribu-tion over the stages, {{and a set of}} 15 procedural rules regimenting the moves discussants may make. These problem-valid rules are instrumental towards the reasonable resolution of the difference of opinion. We take the {{model of a}} critical discussion as constituting a basis for a dialogue protocol allowing agents to play out a dialectical game in order to test the tenability of one agent’s standpoint. The Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF)</b> allows such a dialogue protocol to be translated in terms of its core ontology. The core ontology provides a direc-ted graph data structure in which descriptions of argumentative discourse and arguments can be represented. The AIF can function as interlingua allowing various frameworks and theories of argumentation to interact in theoretically unbiased terms. Establishing a correspondence between pragma-dialectical no-tions and the AIF would provide the latter with a normative natural langu-age discussion model. Furthermore viewing the pragma-dialectical theory from a formalised perspective indicates possible areas of concern which need to be addressed before the theory could get involved further in the field emerging on the intersection between argumentation theory and artificial intelligence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{facilitate}} {{development and}} practical deployment of argumentation systems, a recent shared notation, or Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF),</b> {{has been proposed}} for representation and communication of argumentation knowl-edge amongst agents. The AIF is described as an abstract model, or “ontology”, characterising the core concepts and their relationships. Concrete reifications or syntaxes instantiating these concepts have also been described. Thus far the {{focus has been on}} representation of argument entities and networks, i. e., arguments and sub-arguments and relations of inference, preference and attack amongst these entities. Requirements were envisaged for a separate core ontology for items re-lating to the interchange of arguments, such as locutions and protocols. In this paper we propose that the core argument entity and network ontology can be ex-tended to characterise communication in argumentation based dialogues between agents. We also propose a declarative specification of these communicative con-cepts that is of sufficient generality to serve as an operational semantics. Specifi-cally, we propose use of the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC). We then illustrate our proposal with a use case multi-agent scenario. In presenting this work, our aim is to stimulate further discussion and work on development of the AIF in order to characterise communication in multi-agent dialogues. ...|$|R

40|$|As multi-agent systems (MAS) {{have become}} more mature and systems in general {{have become more}} distributed, it is {{necessary}} {{for those who want to}} build large scale systems to consider, in some computational depth, how agents can communicate in large scale, complex and distributed systems. Currently, some MAS systems have been developed to use an abstract specification language for argumentation. This as a basis for agent communication; to provide effective decision support for agents and yield better agreements. However, as we build complete MAS that involve argumentation, there is a need to produce concrete implementations in which these abstract specifications are realised via protocols coordinating agent behaviour. This creates a gap between standard argument specification and deployment of protocols. This thesis attempts to close this gap by using a combination of automated synthesis and verification methods. More precisely, this thesis proposes a means of moving rapidly from argument specification to protocol implementation using an extension of the Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF</b> is a generic specification language for argument structure) called a Dialogue Interaction Diagram (DID) as the dialogue game specification language and the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC is an executable specification language used for coordinating agents in open systems) as an implementation language.

40|$|The Digging by Debating (DbyD) project {{aimed to}} identify, extract, model, map and visualise {{philosophical}} arguments in very large text repositories {{such as the}} Hathi Trust. The project has: 1) developed a method for visualizing points of contact between philosophy and the sciences; 2) used topic modeling to identify the volumes, and pages within those volumes, which are ‘rich’ in a chosen topic; 3) used a semiformal discourse analysis technique to manually identify key arguments in the selected pages; 4) used the OVA argument mapping tool to represent and map the key identified arguments and {{provide a framework for}} comparative analysis; 5) devised and used a novel analysis framework applied to the mapped arguments covering role, content and source of propositions, and the importance, context and meaning of arguments; 6) created a prototype tool for identifying propositions, using naive Bayes classifiers, and for identifying argument structure in chosen texts, using propositional similarity; 7) created tools to apply topic modeling to tasks of rating similarity of papers in the PhilPapers repository. The methods from 1 to 5 above, have enabled us to locate and extract the key arguments from each text. It is significant that, in applying the methods, a nonexpert with limited or no domain knowledge of philosophy has both identified the volumes of interest from a key ‘Big Data Set’ (Hathi Trust) AND identified key arguments within these texts. This provided several key insights about the nature and form of arguments in historical texts, and is a proofofconcept design for a tool that will be usable by scholars. We have further created a dataset with which to train and test prototype tools for both proposition and argument extraction. Though at an early stage, these preliminary results are promising given the complexity of the task. Specifically, we have prototyped a set of tools and methods that allow scholars to move between macroscale, global views of the distributions of philosophical themes in such repositories, and microscale analyses of the arguments appearing on specific pages in texts belonging to the repository. Our approach spans bibliographic analysis, science mapping, and LDA topic modeling conducted at Indiana University and machineassisted argument markup into Argument Interchange <b>Format</b> (<b>AIF)</b> using the OVA (Online Visualization of Argument) tool from the University of Dundee, where the latter has been used to analyse and represent arguments by the team based at the University of East London, who also performed a detailed empirical analysis of arguments in selected texts. This work has been articulated as a proof of concept tool – linked to the repository PhilPapers – designed by members linked to the University of London. This project is showing for the first time how big data text processing techniques can be combined with deep structural analysis to provide researchers and students with navigation and interaction tools for engaging with the large and rich resources provided by datasets such as the Hathi Trust and PhilPapers. Ultimately our efforts show how the computational humanities can bridge the gulf between the “big data” perspective of firstgeneration digital humanities and the close readings of text that are the “bread and butter” of more traditional scholarship in the humanities...|$|R
