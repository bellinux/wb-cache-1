5|$|Robert Kirkman, {{creator of}} The Walking Dead, {{is a strong}} {{follower}} of The Wire; {{he has tried to}} cast as many actors from it into the television series of the same name <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> far having cast Chad Coleman, Lawrence Gilliard Jr., Seth Gilliam, and Merritt Wever.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Summer Paralympics used many of {{the same}} venues as the 2012 Summer Olympics, along with two new {{locations}} such as Eton Manor for wheelchair tennis and Brands Hatch for road cycling. London's purpose-built Olympic venues and facilities, including the Olympic Village itself, were designed to be accessible <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> they could easily accommodate the Paralympics. Some venues also contained additional accessible seating areas during the Paralympics.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on as long <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{informed}} Whitehead of {{the proposed}} convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as {{to allow for a}} large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.|$|E

60|$|Tarzan of the Apes did not hurry. He {{tried to}} draw out the sweet {{pleasure}} of that journey with those dear arms about his neck <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> and <b>so</b> he went far south of the direct route to the beach.|$|R
5|$|Operation Torch, the Allied {{invasion}} of French North Africa, precipitated {{a crisis in}} Kesselring's command. He ordered Walther Nehring, the former commander of the Afrika Korps who was returning to action after recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, to proceed to Tunisia to take command of a new corps (XC Corps). Kesselring ordered Nehring to establish a bridgehead in Tunisia and then to press west as far <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> as to gain freedom to manoeuvre. By December, the Allied commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, was forced to concede that Kesselring had won the race; {{the final phase of}} Torch had failed and the Axis could only be ejected from Tunisia after a prolonged struggle.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|With Chadwick {{involved}} {{the main goal}} was {{to show that the}} Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain's duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that they might carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat's integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the hasty defences were well-nigh completed, and all the men were {{employed}} in cutting down the thick brushwood outside, so as to clear the ground <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> and <b>so</b> prevent the enemy from stealing up, under shelter, to the felled trees.|$|R
50|$|During the trial, all the {{witnesses}} must bear testimony once again, as must the experts. Plus, all the experiments, {{conducted during the}} preliminary investigations, must be repeated <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> and <b>so</b> on, to allow the defendant to actually participate {{in the process of}} formazione della prova (proof formation).|$|R
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give}} up his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
5|$|From Maryland's {{earliest}} days, Cecil Calvert had enjoined its colonists {{to leave}} religious rivalries behind. Along with giving {{instructions on the}} establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> as not to disturb that peace. The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment {{to the rights of}} man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind. Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland. In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable. This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{computer}} program that plots functions from algebraic input {{should be able}} to determine automatically a useful plotted domain and range for as many types of functions <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Doing <b>so</b> requires some notion of an informative plot, as well as a method for achieving it. This paper presents a set of algorithms for this purpose...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the design}} {{objectives}} of the instrument is to disturb the circuit <b>as</b> little <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> and <b>so</b> the instrument should draw a minimum of current to operate. This is achieved by using a sensitive galvanometer in series with a high resistance, and then the entire instrument {{is connected in parallel}} with the circuit examined.|$|R

25|$|By mid 1915 the South African {{advance in}} German Southwest Africa had gained {{considerable}} ground and efforts at negotiating a ceasefire had failed. Rather than seek a decisive battle, the German commander Victor Franke {{had decided to}} resort to keeping his army as intact <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> as to maintain a German claim to the territory {{after the end of}} the war. Rather than resort to guerrilla warfare or attempt to break out of German Southwest Africa, Franke decided to retreat along the railway and build up defenses around Tsombe. With the South African army under Louis Botha rapidly approaching, Franke decided to leave a delaying force under his second in command Major Hermann Ritter at Otavifontein. The delaying force was tasked with holding up Botha for as long <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that the main force at Tsombe could concentrate its forces and solidify its defenses there.|$|E
25|$|Despite their fame, the McCartneys {{wanted their}} {{children}} to lead as normal a life <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> Stella and her siblings attended local state schools in East Sussex, one of them being Bexhill College.
