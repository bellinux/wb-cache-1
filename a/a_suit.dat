5000|$|The <b>Suits</b> {{index of}} <b>a</b> public {{policy is a}} measure of tax progressiveness, named for {{economist}} Daniel B. Suits. Similar to the Gini coefficient, the Suits index is calculated by comparing the area under the Lorenz curve to the area under a proportional line. [...] For a progressive tax (for example, where higher income tax units pay a greater fraction of their income as tax), the Suits index is positive. A proportional tax (for example, where each unit pays an equal fraction of income) has <b>a</b> <b>Suits</b> index of zero, and a regressive tax (for example, where lower income tax units pay a greater fraction of income in tax) has <b>a</b> negative <b>Suits</b> index. [...] <b>A</b> theoretical tax where the richest person pays all the tax has <b>a</b> <b>Suits</b> index of 1, and a tax where the poorest person pays everything has <b>a</b> <b>Suits</b> index of &minus;1. Tax preferences (credits and deductions) also have <b>a</b> <b>Suits</b> index.|$|R

5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. <b>A</b> <b>suit</b> with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E

5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose.

Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, the disposition of the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams and her daughter and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E
5|$|Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, {{a clumsy}} Gungan exiled {{from his home}} and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting {{director}} Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco. Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character. Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division. They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> for unpaid back wages.|$|E

However, shortly before the release date, Love filed <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> to dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new Nirvana material until the case was resolved. Love contended that Cobain was the band, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she signed the partnership agreement originally under bad advice. Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of <b>a</b> <b>suit</b> filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

He stressed the fact that balancing over <b>a</b> minor <b>suit</b> is markedly different from balancing over <b>a</b> major <b>suit.</b> The difference {{stems from the fact that}} on <b>a</b> minor <b>suit</b> you can double and - after partner's response at 1-level - can rebid 1NT with 15-17 HCP. However, on a takeout double over <b>a</b> major <b>suit,</b> partner will seldom bid at the 1-level. As a result, the 1NT overcall over <b>a</b> major <b>suit</b> needs to be stronger.|$|R
