5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{structural}} {{similarity of}} some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in}} the figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Lacking an infield {{lighting}} system, {{cars were}} driven inside the stadium to illuminate {{it for the}} last two events of the decathlon. The cycling tandem event, which was held in the dark, was <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main venue's lighting issues. After the Games it was used as the English national football stadium, hosting numerous concerts and sporting events, including the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and the British leg of Live Aid in 1985. It was closed in 2000, and demolished three years later to allow the construction of the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, {{also built}} by Christian IV, is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Renaissance style. In 1606, the king first had a two-storey summerhouse {{built on a}} site he used as a park for relaxation. He then decided to start work on a much more ambitious building, the castle, which {{developed}} in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624. Predating the castle, the Renaissance-style park, is Denmark's oldest royal garden.|$|E

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} of relative phase in quantum superposition is Rabi oscillations, where the relative phase of two states varies in time {{due to the}} Schr√∂dinger equation.

Many of the people were killed after torture. The low toll of human deaths {{in comparison with the}} number of burned farms is due to the Erna long-range reconnaissance group breaking the Red Army blockade on the area, allowing many civilians to escape.|$|E
25|$|William Leiper's {{flamboyant}} Gothic Revival St Columba's Church (c.1902) is {{the most}} apparent Category A listed building in the village. The parish church (Old Kirk), mainly constructed in 1831 incorporating a 13th-century chancel, is B-listed and <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Revival style. The third listed church in the parish, Mount Zion Church (Quarrier's Village; 1888; Robert A Bryden) is also Category B listed and in the Scots Baronial style.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{diagnostic}} {{power of}} MALDI/TOF {{is in the}} area of cancer. Pancreatic cancer {{remains one of the most}} deadly and difficult to diagnose cancers. Impaired cellular signaling due to mutations in membrane proteins has been long suspected to contribute to pancreatic cancer. MALDI/TOF has been used to identify a membrane protein associated with pancreatic cancer and at one point may even serve as an early detection technique.|$|E

50|$|Slip joints can be {{designed}} to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The position is fixed using a clamping mechanism based on a cam, a set screw or similar locking mechanism. Slip joints can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's levelling rods. These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fluidity}} of arterial-venous {{identity is}} that of the intersomitic vessel. At early stages, this vessel is connected to the aorta, making it part of the arterial network. However, sprouts from the cardiac vein may fuse with the intersomitic vessel, which slowly disconnects from the aorta and becomes a vein. This process is not fully understood, but may occur out of a need to balance mechanical forces such as pressure and perfusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{style was}} {{especially}} attractive in Russia, {{if only because}} they shared the Eastern Orthodox faith with the Greeks. The historic centre of Saint Petersburg was rebuilt by Alexander I of Russia, with many buildings giving the Greek Revival a Russian debut. The Saint Petersburg Bourse on Vasilievsky Island has a temple front with 44 Doric columns. Leo von Klenze's expansion of the palace that is now the Hermitage Museum is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style.|$|E

25|$|Summertime Wheat, {{a summer}} seasonal, is a Bavarian-style wheat beer, or Hefeweizen, with rye {{added to the}} grist (the brewery has called it a Roggen-Weizen, or rye-wheat, for this reason). Unlike many American craft breweries that produce Hefeweizens with more neutral yeasts (e.g. Sierra Nevada, Pyramid, or Spoetzl (Shiner)), Rahr employs the {{characteristic}} Bavarian wheat beer yeast, resulting in clove- and banana-like flavors. Live Oak Brewing Company's Hefe Weizen is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more traditional Bavarian style. This brew is available from May through June.|$|E
