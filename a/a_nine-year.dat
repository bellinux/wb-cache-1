Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in <b>a</b> <b>nine-year</b> period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous and {{successful}} apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on <b>a</b> <b>nine-year</b> expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced {{to stay on the}} island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergence}} of Chelsea and transitions undergone {{by the two}} clubs during the mid-2000s meant the rivalry became insignificant. Manchester United continued to compete for honours under Ferguson, winning 14 over the next 9 years, while Wenger at Arsenal endured <b>a</b> <b>nine-year</b> trophy drought.
