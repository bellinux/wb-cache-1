40|$|The {{time between}} Failures {{distribution}} observed on four selected <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the distribution}} system of Southwestern Nigeria was investigated in this study. Starting with data gathered on the selected <b>feeder</b> <b>lines,</b> the graphical representation of the time between failure distributions on each of them was presented. Least square plot, Bartlet test and Maximum Likelihood estimator technique were used to establish that the distributions were exponential. The distribution parameter, failure rate denoted by, λ, obtained from the least square plot of the <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> are 0. 0054 f/h, 0. 0071 f/h, 0. 0177 f/h and 0. 026 f/h.

50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> {{is a type}} {{of transmission}} line. In radio engineering, a feeder connects radio equipment to an antenna, usually open wire (air-insulated wire line) or twin-lead from a shortwave transmitter. In power engineering, a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> is part of an electric distribution network, usually a radial circuit of intermediate voltage.|$|R

40|$|Railway {{traction}} {{systems are}} highly susceptible to severe harmonic distortion, poor voltage regulation and line resonances. Electric locomotives, which are concentrated high power loads, move continuously along the supply line, rendering the topography {{of the supply}} system, a time-variable. Under those conditions, the resonant impedances vary as the traction vehicle moves along the track. Parallel resonances with <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> inductance and capacitance between <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> and earth, cause harmonic magnification.
