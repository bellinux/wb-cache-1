Glees costume designer Lou Eyrich {{said in an}} interview with the Seattle Times that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: [...] "He never, ever repeats <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> push yourself creatively.

500|$|Actress and dancer Zoë Lister {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Zoe. On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year. Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: [...] "It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a point where you either make a decision that this is what you do or you want to try something different." [...] She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement. Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star Loui Batley (Sarah Barnes). Hollyoaks officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline.

500|$|During the Hanover Quay {{sessions}} in 2008, Bono {{indicated that he}} had become [...] "tired of [...] the first-person", leading him to write songs {{from the perspective of}} different characters. He invented [...] "a traffic cop, a junkie [...] a soldier serving in Afghanistan." [...] Although each character tells a personal story, the underlying theme of the album is peripheral vision, events taking place in the wider world, [...] "just at the edges". Bono described it as [...] "central to the understanding of this album". Nevertheless, as the characters narrate there is an intentional [...] "shutting out" [...] of the wider world, so that the focus remains on their [...] "personal epiphanies". The narrative the group originally planned for the album was broken up in the sessions' final weeks with their changes to the track listing. Bono revealed that numbers were significant in many of the songs, and that the album was split into thirds; he described the first section as [...] "a whole world unto itself, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a very ecstatic place", and the second as [...] "a load of singles". The final third is composed of songs that are [...] "unusual territory" [...] for the band.|$|E

In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [...] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break.

While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe.
