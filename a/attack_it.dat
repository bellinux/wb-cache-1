5|$|Urate-lowering {{measures}} {{should be}} increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360µmol/l (5.0–6.0mg/dl) and continue indefinitely. If these medications are in chronic {{use at the}} time of an <b>attack,</b> <b>it</b> is recommended that they be continued. Levels that cannot be brought below 6.0mg/dl while attacks continue indicates refractory gout.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under <b>attack,</b> <b>it</b> distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E

5|$|Black {{rushes to}} Beebe's home, knowing the dogs will <b>attack</b> <b>it.</b> Beebe refuses to leave, {{but the house}} has been {{surrounded}} by five dogs; as they are killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists {{the only way to}} rid the town of the dogs is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio do before fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E
5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the <b>attack.</b> <b>It</b> called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E
5|$|In early September, the German Army {{had sent}} a strong force into San Marino to defend it against the Allies; this would also give them control {{of one of the}} major roads in the area, and allow {{artillery}} observers to occupy the mountain peaks. The defending force was drawn from the 278. Infanterie-Division, whilst the 4th Indian Division was assigned to <b>attack</b> <b>it</b> on the 17th.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} strike against the Trade Federation, Kael, Sykes, Ved, Lutin Hollis and Kol Kotha, a {{mercenary}} agent of Borvo's, destroy the communications satellite Comm 4. The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation {{base on the}} planet, allowing the resistance to successfully <b>attack</b> <b>it</b> and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment. During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate labor camps along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{division}} did not fare well, though it improved quickly. Its anti-aircraft and armor assets {{were used as}} mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery and mortar <b>attack.</b> <b>It</b> also conducted constant small-unit patrols along the border seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made {{up the majority of}} {{the division}}'s combat in Korea. Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had to disengage when it was attacked.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May, Johnson {{experienced}} an unusual mission. His section engaged a Dornier Do 217 carrying British markings, four {{miles west of}} his base. Johnson allowed the three inexperienced pilots to <b>attack</b> <b>it,</b> but they only managed to damage the bomber. Days later, on 26 June 1942, Johnson was awarded the Bar to his DFC. More welcome news was received late in the month as the first Spitfire Mk. IXs began reaching RAF units. On 10 July 1942, Johnson was promoted {{to the rank of}} squadron leader, effective as of the 13 July, and given command of 610 Squadron.|$|E

50|$|The {{plain tiger}} is {{protected}} from attacks {{due to the}} unpalatable alkaloids ingested during the larval stages. The butterfly therefore flies slowly and leisurely, generally {{close to the ground}} and in a straight line. This gives a would-be predator ample time to recognise and avoid <b>attacking</b> <b>it.</b> Inexperienced predators will try <b>attacking</b> <b>it,</b> but will learn soon enough to avoid this butterfly as the alkaloids in its body cause vomiting.|$|R
5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen resting on or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from <b>attack,</b> <b>it</b> seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the copepod Eudactylina rachelae. Some accounts suggest that this ray {{may be able to}} survive out of water for up to a day.|$|E
5|$|The Sa'iqa company {{achieved}} the only discernible {{success of the}} <b>attack.</b> <b>It</b> managed to land four kilometers east of the fort without facing any aerial resistance (as the company was sailing in civilian fishing boats). The company managed to prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort, destroying a number of tanks and vehicles. It also captured six Israeli soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force boarded transport ships {{during the}} afternoon of 13December, and the convoy sailed at midnight. It proceeded to Buna in New Guinea to rendezvous {{with most of the}} escorting destroyers and made a feint north toward Finschhafen before turning toward Arawe after dusk on 14December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30am on 15December, and the 11thAir Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to <b>attack</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Unable to pry the Hürtgen from German hands, the Americans pitted the 4th Infantry Division {{into the}} battle and between 7 November and 3 December this {{division}} lost over 7,000 personnel. After also throwing the 8th Infantry Division into the <b>attack</b> <b>it</b> {{was able to}} take the town of Hürtgen, but was not able to advance much farther given the amount of casualties it had sustained. In total, American forces suffered 24,000 combat casualties and had failed to reach their original objectives, the dams.|$|E
5|$|When the {{consideration}} {{was made that}} the ambulance drivers' weapons incident just prior to Centaur's voyage may have been partially responsible for the <b>attack,</b> <b>it</b> led to the tightening of rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship. Quasi-medical staff, like repatriation teams, were no longer permitted on hospital ships. Ambulance drivers had to transfer from the regular Army to the Australian Army Medical Corps before they were allowed aboard, although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to <b>attack</b> <b>it.</b> Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort is an {{artillery}} fort {{built in the}} 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne <b>attack.</b> <b>It</b> stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river, at a location near East Tilbury that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last {{in a series of}} fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. However, its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.|$|E
5|$|From {{its heyday}} of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. {{steamboat}} production, due largely to its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals {{who lived in the}} district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat in the nearby town of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting to Columbus, Indiana, and {{with the opening of the}} Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate <b>attack,</b> <b>it</b> was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains from Hurricane Beta, amounting up to 6.39in (162mm), {{and strong}} winds caused {{extensive}} property damage in Nicaragua. Six people were confirmed {{to have been}} killed by Beta in Nicaragua, one of which was caused by a heart <b>attack.</b> <b>It</b> was initially feared that ten others, who were listed as missing, were killed when their vessel disappeared during the storm. But they were later rescued by a Panamanian vessel after drifting in the waters for several hours. Throughout the country, a total of 376 latrines, 215 homes, two schools, two community children centres, two community water tanks and five solar panels were destroyed. An additional 852 homes, 21 schools, and three health centres were damaged. The cost to repair damages caused by the hurricane were estimated at $2.1million (2006USD). A total of 2,668 people were left homeless {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E
