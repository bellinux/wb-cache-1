5|$|An antipope is a {{historical}} papal claimant not recognized <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> by the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike papal tombs, the tombs of antipopes have generally not been preserved, with a few notable exceptions.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{brothers}} {{in their early}} 20s, one of them armed with a knife, attacked a 63-year-old man in a town in the Northern Bohemian borderland. He shot both attackers with his legally owned pistol, killing one of them. The police closed the case <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> self-defense six months later and brought charges against the surviving attacker.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 110 papal {{elections}} that have produced popes currently {{recognized by the}} Catholic Church <b>as</b> <b>legitimate.</b> There was no fixed process for papal succession before 1059 and popes were often selected with substantial secular involvement, if not outright appointment. Since the promulgation of In nomine Domini (1059), however, suffrage has been limited to the College of Cardinals.|$|E

50|$|There {{is another}} street in Iran {{with the same}} name. This is {{because most of the}} {{countries}} don't admit Palestine <b>as</b> a <b>legitimate</b> state. Iraq and Iran chose the name because they don't admit the existence of Israël <b>as</b> a <b>legitimate</b> state.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1928 Florida–Georgia game, Georgia fans trumpeted {{the return}} of center Ike Boland to bolster its defense. Florida's defense, however, {{rendered}} the Georgia Bulldogs' running game, including that of fullback Herdis McCrary, ineffective {{en route to a}} 26–6 victory. This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and solidified the Gators <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> contenders for their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, A {{man with}} {{criminal}} {{and drug abuse}} history attempted to rob a store in Prague, armed with a knife. He managed to stab the store owner, but was shot by his wife and later died in hospital. Police ruled out the shooting <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> self-defense. This case is notable, because the store the man attempted to rob was a gun store, leading many to speculations that the robbery was, in fact, a suicide attempt.|$|E

5|$|Led by Enver Pasha, a coup in Turkey in 1913 sidelined Sultan Mehmed V and {{concentrated}} {{power in the}} hands of a junta. Despite the secular nature of the new government, Turkey retained its traditional influence over the Muslim world. Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled the Muslim holy city of Mecca throughout the war. The Sultan's title of Caliph was recognised <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> by most Muslims, including those in Afghanistan and India.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Chartered {{series was}} a series of {{emergency}} bearer cheques issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (hence the title on the top of these cheques) and the Cargill Cotton Group. They were authorised by the Reserve Bank <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> issues and were valid for six months from the date of issue, the first currency notes of the Zimbabwean dollar to have a time limit. They carry the signature of the company's finance director Priscilla Mutenbwa and operations director Stephen Newton-Howes.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Church had been {{restored}} only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor of Victor IV) abandoned his claims to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church, while Alexander III is recognized <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> successor of St. Peter the Apostle.|$|E

One country, Libya, recognises the SNC <b>as</b> the <b>legitimate</b> government of Syria.|$|R
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government <b>as</b> <b>legitimate.</b> After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|From 2009 to 2012 Ravalomanana {{lived in}} exile in South Africa, where he was engaged in active {{negotiations}} with Rajoelina and former heads of state Albert Zafy and Didier Ratsiraka to organize national elections. In December 2012 he declared he would not present himself as a candidate, then a precondition to the elections being viewed <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> by the international community. TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014, defeating Jean-Louis Robinson, the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana's camp. Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 he was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration. After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015, Ravalomanana announced the re-opening of the Tiko business group and was re-elected the president of TIM.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{government}} relied {{primarily on}} Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted {{to settle the}} crisis permanently by forcing the barons {{to agree to the}} Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them <b>as</b> <b>legitimate.</b> By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.|$|E

5|$|Retiarii first {{appeared}} in the arena during the 1st century AD and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century. The gladiator's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the retiarius the lowliest (and most effeminate) of an already stigmatised (i.e. gladiators) class. Passages from the works of Juvenal, Seneca, and Suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype (retiarii tunicati) who were not viewed <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> retiarii fighters but as arena clowns. Nevertheless, Roman artwork, graffiti, and grave markers include examples of specific net-men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers.|$|E
5|$|The labor {{situation}} in Jerome was complicated. Three separate labor unions—the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (MMSW), the Industrial Workers of the World or IWW, and the Liga Protectora Latina, which represented about 500 Mexican miners—had members in Jerome. In 1917, two miners' strikes involving the IWW, {{which had been}} organizing strikes elsewhere in Arizona and other states, took place in Jerome. Seen as a threat by business interests {{as well as other}} labor unions, the Wobblies, as they were called, were subject nationally to sometimes violent harassment. The MMSW, which in May called a strike against United Verde, regarded the rival IWW with animosity and would not recognize it <b>as</b> <b>legitimate.</b> In response, the IWW members threatened to break the strike. Under pressure, the MMSW voted 467 to 431 to settle for less than they wanted.|$|E
5|$|According to Byzantine custom, the {{coronation}} of an emperor could only {{take place in}} Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and the Patriarch (now Germanus II, 1223–40) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the Metropolitan of Thessalonica, Constantine Mesopotamites, whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea <b>as</b> <b>legitimate,</b> and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile. In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at Arta, chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform {{the coronation}} instead.|$|E

5|$|After the Kneitals had {{rejected}} his request for initiation into Gardnerian Wicca, Buczynski met with another Gardnerian high priestess, Patricia Siero, who instead agreed to initiate both him and Slater. Siero herself had been initiated by Fran Fisher, high priestess of a coven located in Louisville, Kentucky, in June 1973, {{who in turn}} had claimed initiation from Rosemary Buckland. The weekend after returning from Kentucky, Siero initiated Buczynski and Slater through all three degrees of the Gardnerian tradition, entitling them to operate as high priests of their own covens. Buczynski decided to do so, founding his own Gardnerian coven with an older German woman named Renate Springer as high priestess that operated in the Brooklyn Heights area. Nevertheless, the Kneitals refused to accept Buczynski's Gardnerian credentials, asserting that Rosemary Buckland had never actually initiated Fran Fischer up to the third degree. As {{a result of the}} Kneitals' claims, the Gardnerian community in the Northeastern United States widely refused to accept the Brooklyn Heights coven <b>as</b> <b>legitimate,</b> and Siero decided to take up the Kneitals' offer for re-initiation; as a result, she disowned the initiations of Buczynski and Slater which she had carried out. Springer was uneasy at the situation, and decided to depose Buczynski from his position as high priest, replacing him with one of her initiates, Gilbert Littlebear.|$|E
5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} of the pattern of late {{marriage}} {{for both men and women}} (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted <b>as</b> <b>legitimate.</b> Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s. They could also act as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest award in the military of the Third Reich. During or shortly after World War II, 457 servicemen of the Waffen-SS, including volunteers and conscripts from Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands and Norway, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 411 presentations were formally made and evidence of the award {{is available in the}} German Federal Archives. One recipient, Hermann Fegelein, was court-martialed and executed on 29 April 1945. According to German law he was deprived of rank and all awards previously. Fegelein must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient. A further 46 Knight's Cross, 8 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and 4 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords recipients are either lacking the evidence to sustain their listings or received the award under questionable legal terms. However, all of them were accepted by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger des Eisernen Kreuzes e.V.) <b>as</b> <b>legitimate</b> recipients.|$|E
