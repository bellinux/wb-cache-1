5|$|Male elands have 31 diploid {{chromosomes}} {{and females}} have 32. The male (Y) chromosome has been translocated {{to the short}} arm of an <b>autosome.</b> Both the X and Y replicate late; they do not match well and are variable. The chromosomes resemble those of the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros).|$|E
25|$|The X-inactivation center (or simply XIC) on the X {{chromosome}} {{is necessary}} and sufficient to cause X-inactivation. Chromosomal translocations which place the XIC on an <b>autosome</b> lead to inactivation of the <b>autosome,</b> and X chromosomes lacking the XIC are not inactivated.|$|E
25|$|Iminoglycinuria is {{believed}} to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means a defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an <b>autosome,</b> and inheritance requires two copies of the defective geneone from each parent. Parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.|$|E
5000|$|A metafemale (or superfemale) {{is a low}} {{viability}} Drosophila {{fruit fly}} with a female phenotype in which the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of <b>autosomes</b> (A) exceeds 1.0. For example: a fly with one X chromosome and two sets of <b>autosomes</b> is a normal male, a fly with two X chromosomes and two sets of <b>autosomes</b> is a normal female, and a fly with three X chromosomes and two sets of <b>autosomes</b> (or four X chromosomes and three sets of <b>autosomes)</b> is a metafemale.|$|R
40|$|A {{new study}} in Caenorhabditis elegans shows that {{homologous}} <b>autosomes</b> segregate non-randomly with the sex chromosome in the heterogametic sex. Segregation occurs according to size, small <b>autosomes</b> segregating with, and large <b>autosomes</b> segregating {{away from the}} X-chromosome. Such sex-biased transmission of <b>autosomes</b> could facilitate the spread of sexually antagonistic alleles whose effects favor the fitness of one sex {{at the expense of}} the other. This may provide a first step toward the evolution of new sex determination systems. ...|$|R
50|$|A metamale (or supermale) {{is a low}} {{viability}} Drosophila {{fruit fly}} with a male phenotype in which the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of <b>autosomes</b> (A) is less than 0.5.

25|$|These tables {{give the}} total number of {{chromosomes}} (including sex chromosomes) in a cell nucleus. For example, human cells are diploid and have 22 different types of <b>autosome,</b> each present as two copies, and two sex chromosomes. This gives 46 chromosomes in total. Other organisms have more than two copies of their chromosome types, such as bread wheat, which is hexaploid and has six copies of seven different chromosome types– 42 chromosomes in total.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a few studies which supportted {{alternative}} arrangements. One being a sister relationship between the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and spiral-horned antelopes. Historically the nilgai was classified as a tragelaphine by some scientists. Benirschke et al. (1980) work on karyotypes on the lesser kudu found the them {{to share with the}} nilgai in having their X chromosome in a fusion with <b>autosome</b> 14. Another study that analyzed the COII gene found the nilgai and lesser kudu being sister species (although the support was low and had limited species sampling). Majority of other molecular and morphological work do not support the placement of the nilgai in Tragelaphini, as it contradicts with their data and results.|$|E
40|$|Recent multilocus {{studies of}} congeneric birds {{have shown a}} pattern of {{elevated}} interspecific divergence on the Z chromosome compared to the <b>autosomes.</b> In contrast, intraspecifically, birds exhibit less polymorphism on the Z chromosome relative to the <b>autosomes.</b> We show that the four black-and-white Ficedula flycatcher species show greater genetic divergence on the Z chromosome than on the <b>autosomes,</b> and that the ratios of intraspecific polymorphism at Z-linked versus autosomal markers are below the neutral expectation of 75 %. In all species pairs, we found more fixed substitutions and fewer shared polymorphisms on the Z chromosome than on the <b>autosomes.</b> Finally, using isolation with migration (IMa) models we estimated gene flow among the four closely related flycatcher species. The results suggest that different pattern of evolution of Z chromosomes and <b>autosomes</b> is best explained by the faster-Z hypothesis, since the estimated long-term gene flow parameters were close to zero in all comparisons...|$|R

25|$|Many of {{the genes}} which escape {{inactivation}} are present along regions of the X chromosome which, unlike {{the majority of the}} X chromosome, contain genes also present on the Y chromosome. These regions are termed pseudoautosomal regions, as individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in these regions (like an <b>autosome),</b> unlike the majority of genes along the sex chromosomes. Since individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in a pseudoautosomal region, no dosage compensation is needed for females, so it is postulated that these regions of DNA have evolved mechanisms to escape X-inactivation. The genes of pseudoautosomal regions of the Xi do not have the typical modifications of the Xi and have little Xist RNA bound.|$|E
500|$|The ruff {{has three}} male forms, which differ in mating {{behaviour}} and in appearance: the typical territorial males {{which have a}} dark neck ruff, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and the very rare cryptic males known as [...] "faeders" [...] which have female-like plumage. [...] The behaviour and appearance of each individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by a simple genetic polymorphism. Territorial behaviour and appearance is recessive to satellite behaviour and appearance, [...] while preliminary research {{results suggest that the}} faeder characteristics are genetically controlled by a single dominant gene. [...] It was originally thought that the difference between territorial and satellite males was due to a sex-linked genetic factor, but in fact the genetic locus relevant for the mating strategy is located on an <b>autosome,</b> or non-sex chromosome. That means that both sexes can carry the two different forms of the gene, not just males. The female does not normally show evidence of its genetic type, but when females are given testosterone implants, they display the male behaviour corresponding to their genotype.|$|E
2500|$|Populations {{that have}} a {{specific}} combination of <b>autosome,</b> Y and MT-haplogroup mutations can generally be found with regional variations. Autosomes, Y mutations and mt mutations do not necessarily occur at a similar time and there are differential rates of sexual selection between the two sex chromosomes. This combined with population bottlenecks, the founder effect, mitochondrial mutations and genetic drift will alter the genetic composition of isolated populations, resulting in very distinguishable mutation patterns. (i.e. Taínos, Fuegians, Inuit, Yupik and Algonquian) ...|$|E
30|$|The {{comparison}} of chromosomal complements {{between the three}} studied populations shows great similarities between them. All the karyotypes contain 52 chromosomes with 8 to 10 bi-armed and 17 to 15 acrocentric <b>autosomes.</b> The sex chromosomes reveal variation in the centromeric position but their size seems similar in all individuals. The homology of the bi-armed <b>autosomes</b> between individual complements seems uncertain, and it is even improbable in some cases (e.g., in the two largest autosomal pairs). Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate the nature of homology and possible rearrangements involved in presumed diversification {{without the use of}} appropriate banding techniques. The pattern of the distribution of C-positive heterochromatin regions is also similar in the three karyotypes compared, with dark centromeric bands occurring in most of the bi-armed <b>autosomes</b> and the sex chromosomes and in some of the acrocentric <b>autosomes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Most embryos cannot survive with {{a missing}} or extra <b>autosome</b> (numbered chromosome) and are spontaneously aborted. The most {{frequent}} aneuploidy in humans is trisomy 16, although fetuses affected {{with the full}} version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term (it is possible for surviving individuals to have the mosaic form, where trisomy 16 exists in some cells but not all). [...] The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 800 births. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) affects 1 in 6,000 births, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) affects 1 in 10,000 births. 10% of infants with trisomy 18 or 13 reach 1 year of age.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>autosome</b> (atDNA) is a {{chromosome}} {{that is not}} a sex chromosome – that is to say, there are an equal number of copies of the chromosome in males and females. Autosomal DNA testing is generally used to determine the [...] "genetic percentages" [...] of a person's ancestry from particular continents/regions or to identify the countries and [...] "tribes" [...] of origin on an overall basis. Genetic admixture tests arrive at these percentages by examining locations (SNPs) on the DNA where one nucleotide has [...] "mutated" [...] or [...] "switched" [...] to a different nucleotide. One way to examine the support for particular colonization routes within the American landmass is to determine whether a closer relationship between zygosity and geography is observed when [...] "effective" [...] geographic distances are computed along these routes, rather than along shortest-distance paths.|$|E
40|$|The karyotype, C-banding, and nucleoar {{organizer}} regions (NORs) {{of eight}} specimens of Konya wild sheep from Turkey were examined.
