5000|$|Esslinger {{was born}} in Beuren (Simmersfeld), in Germany's Black Forest. At age 25, Esslinger {{finished}} his studies at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd in Schwäbisch Gmünd. After facing vicious criticism of a radio clock he designed while in school and the disapproval of his mother (who burned his sketchbooks), he started his own design agency in 1969, later renamed Frogdesign. For his first client, German <b>avant-garde</b> <b>consumer</b> electronics company Wega, he created the first [...] "full plastics" [...] color TV and HiFi series [...] "Wega system 3000". His work for Wega won him instant international fame. In 1974, Esslinger was hired by Sony - Sony also acquired Wega shortly after - and he was instrumental in creating a global design image for Sony, especially with the Sony Trinitron and personal music products. The Sony-Wega Music System Concept 51K was chosen by the Museum of Modern Art, New York.|$|E
40|$|Consumer innovativeness and GLB: A {{comparative}} study Many companies survive {{because of the}} development {{and the introduction of}} successful new products 3. According to Hultink and Schoormans (2004), 40 to 50 percent of the return and the profit of US and UK companies comes from products introduced on the market less than five years ago. However, new products often do not find their way to buyers: Hultink and Schoormans (2004) state that 30 to 50 % of new products fail. The diffusion literature (e. g. Rogers, 2003) counts on innovative people to make a new product successful. When these innovative persons are known, a deliberate and efficient communication campaign can be developed and innovators can be targeted (Fell et al. 2003). But, who are innovative persons and how can they be effectively targeted? Marketers often try to reach and attract them via mass media communication and mass sampling, without much success though. Therefore, {{it would be interesting to}} find a subgroup within the society that is significantly more innovative than others. In this respect, several non-academic articles refer to the assumed innovativeness of gays, lesbians and bisexuals (GLB) (Kolko et al. 2003, Wilke 2000, Marketresearch. com 2000). GLB are supposed to be trendsetters and are called “the <b>avant-garde</b> of <b>consumers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{interconnections}} between Italian <b>avant-garde</b> art, <b>consumer</b> culture, and World War I. Beginning with {{its inception in}} 1909, Italian Futurism advanced the idea that war {{was a form of}} global hygiene. Chapter 1 introduces the political context of such a rhetoric of hygiene and violence and relates this to a group of art works depicting scenes of urban conflict. Chapter 2 considers hygiene as it was presented to Italy 2 ̆ 7 s mass audience in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s expanding consumer culture. The advertising of commercial hygiene products reflected a variety of bourgeois myths of order and controlled social change. This promotion became a source of reference for avant-garde artists. My discussion interprets Carlo Carra 2 ̆ 7 s free-word collage Patriotic Festival as an effort to mediate Italy 2 ̆ 7 s political crisis of June 1914, 2 ̆ 7 Red Week, 2 ̆ 7 by invoking commercial mythologies of social health. The following two chapters focus on events after August 1914, when the government declared Italy 2 ̆ 7 s neutrality in the war. This led an unusual political coalition of nationalists, syndicalists, dissident socialists, irredentists, and members of the avant-garde to wage a heated campaign in support of intervention on the side of France. Chapter 3 analyzes Carlo Carra 2 ̆ 7 s interventionist book Guerrapittura (War-painting) of 1915. Carra creates analogies between a dynamic new Futurist perspective, based on the vision of aviators, and the defeat of programmatic party politics reflected in the political realignments occurring in this period of national debate. Cultural ramifications of Italy 2 ̆ 7 s political crisis are considered in Chapter 4, where causes are sought for the public rift that developed between the Milanese Futurists and Florentine Lacerbiani. The split within the avant-garde was motivated by divergent attitudes towards the mass public. Ardengo Soffici and Giovanni Papini became critical of F. T. Marinetti 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 free-word 2 ̆ 7 poetry which they interpreted as an effort to reach a mass public by imitating the procedures of consumer marketing. Their belief that art should remain elite and 2 ̆ 2 aristocratic 2 ̆ 2 led to efforts to reform Futurist style with broad implications for visual artists. My final chapter surveys discursive and visual constructions of the war from both the mass media and the avant-garde. ...|$|R
