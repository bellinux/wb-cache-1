40|$|Purpose: We {{compared}} the prophylactic effects of intravenously administered <b>azasetron</b> (10 mg) and ondansetron (8 mg) on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Materials and Methods: We studied 98 ASA physical status I or II 20 - 65 years old, female patients, in this prospective, randomized, double blind study. Patients were randomly {{divided into two}} groups and received ondansetron 8 mg (group O) or <b>azasetron</b> 10 mg (group A) 5 min before the end of surgery. The incidence of PONV, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, need for rescue antiemetic and analgesics, and adverse effects were checked at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. Results: The overall incidence of PONV was 65 % in group O and 49 % in group A. The incidence of PONV was significantly higher in group O than in group A at 12 - 24 h postoperatively (nausea; 24 % vs. 45 %, p = 0. 035, vomiting; 2 % vs. 18 %, p = 0. 008), but {{there were no significant differences}} at 0 - 1, 1 - 6, 6 - 12 or 24 - 48 h. Conclusion: In conclusion, <b>azasetron</b> (10 mg) produced same incidence of PONV as ondansetron (8 mg) in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological laparoscopic surgery. <b>Azasetron</b> was more effective, in the intermediate post-operative period, between 12 and 24 h.

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{high-performance}} liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of five antiemetic agents in infusion samples: dexamethasone, ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, and <b>azasetron.</b> The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Phenomenex C 18 column (4. 6 [*]mm × 150 [*]mm, 5 [*]μm) using acetonitrile- 50 [*]mM KH 2 PO 4 buffer-triethylamine (25 [*]:[*] 74 [*]:[*] 1; v/v; pH 4. 0). Flow rate was 1. 0 [*]mL/min with a column temperature of 30 °C. Validation of the method was made in terms of specificity, linearity, accuracy, and intra- and interday precision, as well as quantification and detection limits. The developed method {{can be used in}} the laboratory to routinely quantify dexamethasone, ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, and <b>azasetron</b> simultaneously and to evaluate the physicochemical stability of referred drugs in mixtures for endovenous use...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in conscious, chronically instrumented, male, Sprague-Dawley rats to {{delineate}} the regional haemodynamic effects of the putative endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, (0. 075 [*]–[*] 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), and to dissect some of the mechanisms involved. At all doses of anandamide, there was a significant, short-lived increase in mean arterial blood pressure associated with vasoconstriction in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. The higher doses (2. 5 and 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), caused an initial, marked bradycardia accompanied, in some animals, by a fall in arterial blood pressure which preceded the hypertension. In addition, after the higher doses of anandamide, the hindquarters vasoconstriction was followed by vasodilatation. Although some of the effects described above resembled those of 5 -HT (25 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), the bradycardia and hypotensive actions of the latter were abolished by the 5 HT 3 -receptor antagonist, <b>azasetron,</b> whereas those of anandamide were generally unaffected. None of the cardiovascular actions of anandamide were influenced by the CB 1 -receptor antagonist, AM 251, but its bradycardic effect was sensitive to atropine, and its hindquarters vasodilator action was suppressed by the β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551. The results differ, in several aspects, from those previously reported in anaesthetized animals, and underscore the important impact anaesthesia can have on responses to anandamide...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antiemetic effect of aprepitant and to determine how to provide triple combination therapy (aprepitant/azasetron/dexamethasone) to women receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study was a prospective study of 163 women with gynecologic cancers. We compared the digestive symptoms scores (nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, and dietary intake) of 37 women with ovarian cancers before and after aprepitant administration. We also compared these symptoms in women who underwent 193 cycles of triple combination therapy with symptoms of women who underwent 226 cycles of double combination therapy. For triple combination therapy, <b>azasetron,</b> dexamethasone (reduced dose: 40 % of 20 mg), and aprepitant (125 mg) were administered on Day 1, followed by only aprepitant (80 mg) administration on Days 2 and Day 3. RESULTS: In 37 women with ovarian cancer, three symptoms, nausea, appetite loss, and dietary intake, were significantly improved by primarily adding aprepitant to double combination therapy in the delayed phase of MEC. Upon comparing their digestive symptoms in all cycles, however, these three symptoms were not significantly different in the delayed phase. Furthermore, all four symptoms in all cycles were worse following triple combination therapy than following double combination therapy in the acute phase (p< 0. 02). The control of digestive symptoms was generally insufficient without the administration of dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Primary aprepitant as an addition to MEC demonstrated efficacy in improving digestive symptoms in the delayed phase. However, its effect may decrease with repeated use. To improve the antiemetic effect, the dose reduction of dexamethasone should be restricted on Day 1 and dexamethasone should be used throughout the delayed phase as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to mainly evaluate the activity and safety of olanzapine compared with 5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 (5 -HT 3) receptor antagonists for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting(CINV) in patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC or MEC). The second goal was to evaluate the impact of olanzapine on quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients during the period of chemotherapy. Methods 229 patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy were randomly assigned to the test group [olanzapine(O) 10 mg p. o. plus <b>azasetron</b> (A) 10 mg i. v. and dexamethasone (D) 10 mg i. v. on day 1; O 10 mg once a day on days 2 - 5] or the control group (A 10 mg i. v. and D 10 mg i. v. on day 1; D 10 mg i. v. once a day on days 2 - 5). All the patients filled the observation table of CINV once a day on days 1 - 5, patients were instructed to fill the EORTC QLQ-C 30 QoL observation table on day 0 and day 6. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) (without nausea and vomiting, no rescue therapy) for the acute period (24 h postchemotherapy), delayed period (days 2 - 5 poschemotherapy), the whole period (days 1 - 5 postchemotherapy). The second endpoint was QoL during chemotherapy administration, drug safety and toxicity. Results 229 patients were evaluable for efficacy. Compared with control group, complete response for acute nausea and vomiting in test group had no difference (p > 0. 05), complete response for delayed nausea and vomiting in patients with highly emetogenic chemotherapy respectively improved 39. 21 % (69. 64 % versus 30. 43 %, p Conclusion Olanzapine can improve the complete response of delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving the highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy comparing with the standard therapy of antiemesis, as well as improve the QoL of the cancer patients during chemotherapy administration. Olanzapine is a safe and efficient drug for prevention of CINV. </p...|$|E
30|$|Adrenergic {{receptor}} {{family has}} five major members, α 1, α 2, β 1, β 2 and β 3 receptors (Bang and Choi, 2015). And the 7 general 5 -HT receptor classes include {{a total of}} 14 known 5 -HT receptors, including 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 1 B, 5 -HT 1 D, 5 -HT 1 E, 5 -HT 1 F, 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 B, 5 -HT 2 C, 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 4, 5 -HT 5 A, 5 -HT 5 B, 5 -HT 6 and 5 -HT 7 receptors (Barnes and Sharp, 1999). We first selected other selective antagonists to assess which GPCRs antagonism of PBZ is responsible for HCV inhibition. Alfuzosin (a selective α 1 AR antagonist) (Wilde et al., 1993), atipamezole (a selective α 2 AR antagonist) (Vacher et al., 2010), and acebutolol (a βAR antagonist) (van den Meiracker et al., 1988), atenolol (a selective β 1 AR antagonist) (Baldwin et al., 1986) and (S)-timolol maleate (a β 1 AR and β 2 AR antagonist) (Weinstock et al., 1976) present no inhibition on HCV proliferation, suggesting HCV inhibition of PBZ is not correlated to its antagonism on adrenergic receptors (Figs.  1 A, 1 B and S 1 A). Similarly, agomelatine (a 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 2 C receptors antagonist) (Popoli, 2009), <b>azasetron</b> (a selective 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists) (Tsukagoshi, 1999), piboserod (a selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist) (Brattelid et al., 2004), SB 742457 (a selective 5 -HT 6 receptor antagonist) (Upton et al., 2008) and SB 269970 (a selective 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist) (Mahe et al., 2004) do not display HCV inhibition till 20  μmol/L (Figs.  1 A, 1 C and S 1 B). SB 699551, which is a selective 5 -HT 5 A receptor antagonist (Corbett et al., 2005), also did not present anti-HCV activity at the concentration with no cytotoxicity (Fig. S 1 C). Together hints the antagonism of 5 -HT 2 AR by PBZ is responsible for HCV inhibition.|$|E
