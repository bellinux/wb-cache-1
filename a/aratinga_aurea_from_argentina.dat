The objective is obtain data on feeding {{behavior of}} the Peach-fronted Parakeet (<b>Aratinga</b> <b>aurea)</b> in southwestern Minas Gerais State. Thirty-three plant species were eaten by A. aurea. Hyptis suaveolens (Lamiaceae) and Psidium guajava (Myrtaceae) were the most consumed. <b>Aratinga</b> <b>aurea</b> fed on flowers, fruit pulp but seeds were the most consumed item. The use of leaves as food was recorded only for Pyrus communis (Rosaceae), on a single feeding bout. From 33 species eaten, parakeets used seeds from 18 species, fruit pulp from seven and flowers from 12 species. The methods used to obtain food varied according {{to the size of}} plant species, as well as the morphology. Generally, it was possible to define three basic strategies: (1) the bird pecks the food without ripping it from the branch, (2) the birds plucks off the food with its beak and grinds it, (3) the bird plucks off the food with its beak, grabs it using its foot and only then starts to eat it. There was statistically significant variation of the methods used in relation to the food item. The flock size during feeding is highly variable. Flock size varied from one individual eating alone to 20 individuals at the same site. Records of flocks of one or two birds were mostly made during breeding period...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the stomach {{contents}} of 70 individuals belonging to 36 species and 12 families of non-passerine birds of the Ornithological Collection Marcelo Bagno, University of Brasilia, Brazil. The stomachs, mostly collected {{during the rainy season}} and in the Cerrado area, were opened and their food items sorted to the nearest taxonomic level. Virtually all stomachs contained food items consistent with the literature. Galbula ruficauda, however, had plant material in its stomach, although it is considered insectivorous. It is interesting to mention that species considered omnivorous, such as Rhynchotus rufescens, Nothura maculosa and Ramphastos toco, contained only animal material in their stomachs. Columbina talpacoti, Leptotila verreauxi and Leptotila rufaxilla, which can supplement their diet with arthropods, ate only vegetable material, reinforcing items of animal origin as unusual in their diet. Geotrygon montana, C. talpacoti, L. verreauxi, N. maculosa, <b>Aratinga</b> <b>aurea</b> and <b>Aratinga</b> cactorum had stones in their stomachs, which can help to macerate food items. This study covers non-passerines poorly sampled in the literature and can assist in improving the knowledge about the diet of these species...|$|R

40|$|Birds play {{crucial role}} on the {{pollination}} of many plants. However, {{little is known about}} the interactions between nectarivorous neotropical birds and exotic Angiosperms. S. nilotica is an exotic African plant widely used in Brazilian urban landscaping. However, it has been poorly studied in relation to its interactions with Neotropical birds. In this way, we studied the feeding nectar strategies and the interspecific antagonistic behaviours among nectarivorous Neotropical birds to verify the bird contributions to the S. nilotica pollination. The study was conducted from May 2008 to April 2011, but only in months of S. nilotica flowering (April to May). From 148 hours of sampling we identified 16 species feeding nectar on S. nilotica: 13 hummingbirds (Trochilidae), <b>Aratinga</b> <b>aurea</b> (Psittacidae), Tangara palmarum (Thraupidae) and Coereba flaveola (Coerebidae). Eupetomena macroura was the most frequent (96. 88 %), followed by Chlorostilbon lucidus (78. 13 %) and Coereba flaveola (59. 38 %). Most birds obtained nectar by punching at the base of the corolla, except for A. aurea that obtained the nectar by the upper opening of the petals in 100 % of its visits, Heliomaster furcifer (95. 65 %), F. fusca (95 %) and A. nigricollis (70. 27 %). Despite E. macroura also obtains nectar only by punching at the base of the corolla, it showed the highest level of legitimate visits. Antagonistic events were more frequent in E. macroura (58. 65 %), Florisuga fusca (11. 04 %) and Amazilia fimbriata (10. 87 %), being E. macroura dominant in all events. These results showed E. macroura plays an important role on this plant being the most important bird as a potential pollinator. Moreover, other birds contribute partially to the S. nilotica pollination. Most probably it is a result of recent Neotropical bird interactions with this African plant...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{management}} ran {{increase the}} biomass of some plant species at fire breaks in reserves of the Cerrado. For example, numerous and large patches of monkey-nuts (Anacardium humile, Anacardiaceae) provide abundant food resources for wildlife in the lower strata of savanna woodlands managed by fire. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the exploitation of A. humile patches by birds in managed savanna woodlands (fire breaks) at Emas National Park, southwest Brazil. The relationship between flock size and the size of Anacardium patches were also investigated. Fire breaks were sampled in September and October 2006, when fruits and flowers were abundant. Ara ararauna was often recorded exploiting resources of Anacardium patches. This species and other psittacids (Amazona aestiva, Alipiopsittaca xanthops, and Diopsittaca nobilis) consumed seeds usually on the ground around fruiting patches. Members of <b>Aratinga</b> <b>aurea</b> flocks and Ramphastos toco consumed pseudo-fruits. Larger flocks detected were those of A. aurea and A. ararauna. Groups of A. ararauna that exploited larger patches tended to be larger than flocks that exploited smaller patches. This study suggests that intra- and interspecific interactions and characteristics of Anacardium patches and of the surrounding vegetation are involved in the feeding ecology of birds in the lower stratum of managed woodlands. Fruiting Anacardium patches attract numerous frugivorous birds to fire breaks at Emas National Park. Further research is needed to a better understanding of the influence of fire management on birds in the Cerrado. Accepted 31 July 2009.
