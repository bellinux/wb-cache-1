40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a surviellance / diagnostic system using a <b>small</b> <b>airship</b> which can check the state of the ground and the soundness of public facilities from a height of 10 m- 100 m above the ground. In order to observe the ground from above satisfactorily, an airship must be held stationary in position above the ground. However, as a <b>small</b> <b>airship</b> has a comparatively large hull, but is lightweight, so it is difficult to control its position against any wind. This research aims to develop the position control system to keep an airship at a fixed point in wind conditions of about 3 m/s. Four different types of airship (3 m- 5 m) have been developed since 2002. Here, the outline of each of these <b>small</b> <b>airship</b> types, and advanced content of the relevant research results about a position and attitude control system are presented. The bird's eye viewer system was conducted successfully from a height of 200 m or more above the ground, and the fundamental design method of a simple ground observation system was established. However a better position and attitude control system is needed to make the practical use of ground observation from a <b>small</b> <b>airship</b> complete...|$|R

40|$|Pseudo-spectral optimal solvers {{are used}} to {{optimize}} numerically a performance index of a dynamical system with differential constraints. Although these solvers are commonly used for space vehicles and space launchers for trajectory optimization, few experimental papers exist on optimal control of <b>small</b> <b>airships.</b> The objective of this thesis is {{to evaluate the use}} of a pseudo-spectral optimal control solver for generating dynamically constrained, minimal time trajectories. A dynamical model of a <b>small</b> <b>airship</b> is presented, with its experimental virtual mass, drag and motor experimentally modeled. The problems are solved in PSOPT, a pseudo-spectral optimal control code. Experimental tests with a small scale model are performed to evaluate the generated paths. Although drift occurs, as a consequence of an open loop control, the vehicle is capable of following the path. This results of this thesis may find uses in verifying how close to optimal discreet path planners are, to plan complex trajectories on short distances, or to generate dynamic maneuverer such as take-off or landing. Ultimately, improving path planning of <b>small</b> <b>airships</b> will improve their safety, maneuverability and flight-time, which makes them fit for scientific monitoring, for search and rescue, or as mobile telecommunications platforms...|$|R

The inertial measurement unit was built with lower grade sensors, resulting in significant reductions in component cost. To ensure accurate navigation results, the high rate inertial measurements were complemented with low rate GPS velocity and position updates in an extended Kalman filter configuration. A study was made of various Kalman filter configurations, especially the possibility of splitting a big Kalman filter into smaller Kalman filters. It {{was found that the}} best trade-off between accuracy and processing power was achieved by having two smaller Kalman filters running in sequence.
