Men and women enjoy chewing betel nut mixed with, betel leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells. They eat rice for meal, first they took <b>a</b> <b>scoop</b> <b>of</b> water and soak betel in their mouth, then wash their hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably coconut milk) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it in their mouth. When {{receiving}} guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{customary}} {{that family}} mealtimes differ: breakfast food differs from supper and snacks, weekends frequently vary from the weekday diet. In one busy family <b>a</b> <b>scoop</b> <b>of</b> ice cream on the breakfast cereal turned the meal into an easy, fun supper. There {{might also be}} a traditional Sunday Dinner to be prepared and staged weekly with an expanded family group gathered around the table.|$|E

[...] And I remember thinking, as I read, that in each breaking wave was some particle which had visited every shore in all the world--that in each sparkle of hot sunlight stealing that bright water up into the sky, was the microcosm of all change, and of all unity.|$|E

Another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who snorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the {{backbone}} flew over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's astonished mouth. After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along {{as though they were}} alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whenever I plunge my arm, like this, In a {{basin of}} water, I never miss The sweet sharp {{sense of a}} {{fugitive}} day Fetched back from its thickening shroud of gray. [...] Hence the only prime [...] And real love-rhyme [...] That I know by heart, [...] And that leaves no smart, Is the purl of a little valley fall About three spans wide and two spans tall Over a table of solid rock, And into <b>a</b> <b>scoop</b> <b>of</b> the self-same block; The purl of a runlet that never ceases In stir of kingdoms, in wars, in peaces; With a hollow boiling voice it speaks And has spoken since hills were turfless peaks." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{drank some}} tea; went out, {{and took a}} path up to the moor. It was not yet eight o'clock {{when he reached the}} top of the nearest tor. And there, below him, around, and above, was a land and sky transcending even his exaltation. It was like a symphony of great music; or the nobility of a stupendous mind laid bare; it was God up there, in His many moods. Serenity was spread in the middle heavens, blue, illimitable, and along to the East, three huge clouds, like {{thoughts}} brooding over the destinies below, moved slowly toward the sea, so that great shadows filled the valleys. And the land that lay under all the other sky was gleaming, and quivering with every colour, as it were, clothed with the divine smile. The wind, from the North, whereon floated the white birds of the smaller clouds, had no voice, for it was above barriers, utterly free. Before Miltoun, turning to this wind, lay the maze of the lower lands, the misty greens, rose pinks, and browns of the fields, and white and grey dots and strokes of cottages and church towers, fading into the blue veil of distance, confined by a far range of hills. Behind him there was nothing but the restless surface of the moor, coloured purplish-brown. On that untamed sea of graven wildness could be seen no ship of man, save one, on the far horizon--the grim hulk, Dartmoor Prison. There was no sound, no scent, and it seemed to Miltoun as if his spirit had left his body, and become part of the solemnity of God. Yet, as he stood there, with his head bared, that strange smile which haunted him in moments of deep feeling, showed that he had not surrendered to the Universal, that his own spirit was but being fortified, and that this was the true and secret source of his delight. He lay down in <b>a</b> <b>scoop</b> <b>of</b> the stones. The sun entered there, but no wind, so that a dry sweet scent exuded from the young shoots of heather. That warmth and perfume crept through the shield of his spirit, and stole into his blood; ardent images rose before him, the vision of an unending embrace. Out of an embrace sprang Life, out of that the World was made, this World, with its innumerable forms, and natures--no two alike! And from him and her would spring forms to take their place in the great pattern. This seemed wonderful, and right-for they would be worthy forms, who would hand on those traditions which seemed to him so necessary and great. And then there broke on him one of those delirious waves of natural desire, against which he had so often fought, so often with great pain conquered. He got up, and ran downhill, leaping over the stones, and the thicker clumps of heather.|$|E

50|$|Scoops are {{important}} and likely to interest or concern many people. <b>A</b> <b>scoop</b> is typically <b>a</b> new story, or a new aspect to an existing or breaking news story. Generally the story is unexpected, or surprising, or formerly secret, so the scoop typically comes from an exclusive source. Events witnessed by many people generally cannot become <b>scoops,</b> (e.g., <b>a</b> natural disaster, or the announcement at a press conference). However, exclusive news content is not always <b>a</b> <b>scoop,</b> as it may not provide the requisite importance or excitement. <b>A</b> <b>scoop</b> may be also defined retrospectively; a story may {{come to be known}} as <b>a</b> <b>scoop</b> because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> historical change in perspective of a particular event. Due to their secret nature, scandals are <b>a</b> prime source <b>of</b> <b>scoops</b> (e.g., the Watergate scandal by Washington Post journalists Woodward and Bernstein).|$|R
