Fox later added that she'd [...] "love a big soap wedding". Dawson said, about the couple's future: [...] "Darren might stray if Nancy continues to push him away, but I think he's more paranoid about her leaving him. He's been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy</b> far too long - I want him to man up and get his head together".|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} years, the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new {{character}} {{was introduced in}} the form of Perry, a little boy from the backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a duffle coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his old neighborhood. The local gang, the Rinkydinks, in contrast, still wore torn and patchy clothing, and were regarded by Winnie as [...] "loafers." [...] One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce, Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase, [...] "Youse is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy,</b> Denny." ...|$|E
500|$|In the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in {{the same}} prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed {{particular}} disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders {{at the same time}} in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as [...] "just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw for no good reason". However, Kemper himself commented on his [...] "self-righteous talking like that , considering what [...] done". Despite this concession, Kemper still manipulated and physically intimidated the diminutive Mullin, who, standing at , was over a foot shorter than Kemper. Kemper stated that [...] " [...] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy,</b> I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment." ...|$|E

2500|$|After playing 34 {{games with}} the Eagles, Smukler was {{suspended}} in October 1939 for breaking training rules. When owner Bert Bell asked him why, Smukler allegedly told him, “I’m through with football.” Apparently, Smukler had broken training rules various times in the past. He had made a pledge to Bell that this would not happen again, only to break training once more. Bell said, “In my opinion, Dave {{was one of the}} greatest football players in professional football when he wanted to be. But I believe for the best interests of the team and myself we can do better without him as he was a demoralizing influence. He is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy</b> but he just can’t keep his promises.” ...|$|E

[...] The first steps towards reconciliation were made in 2006 when Jim Branning {{received a phone call from}} Nick who was in a prison hospital with cancer. Jim and his grandson, Bradley initially kept this a secret from Dot, but Bradley told his girlfriend, Stacey who let it slip to Dot. Dot went to visit Nick but when he was cleared of his cancer, he refused to let Dot see him.|$|E
2500|$|News of Genie reached {{major media}} outlets on November 17, {{receiving}} {{a great deal}} of local and national attention, and the one photograph authorities released of Genie significantly fueled public interest in her. Although Genie's father refused to speak to police or the media, large crowds subsequently went to try to see him, which he reportedly found extremely difficult to handle. On November 20, the morning before a scheduled court appearance on child abuse charges, he committed suicide by gunshot. Police found two suicide notes, one intended for his son which in part said, [...] "Be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy,</b> I love you", and one directed at police. One note—sources conflict as to which—contained the declaration, [...] "The world will never understand." ...|$|E

Walter Christie, which Kase described as a combination of a battleship, fort and tank that had been tested in the Hudson River and was [...] "expected to revolutionize modern warfare." [...] In January 1923, he wrote a pieces about a painting by Antonio da Correggio, missing since the 15th Century, that had been discovered in Brooklyn. [...] His moving feature from February 1923 about the death of a 17-year-old boy from Manhattan's Lower East Side was also published in Hearst newspapers across the country:"The bustle of the East Side has slightly slowed, the shrill cry of pushcart peddlers is a bit subdued, while on the teeming block of Eldridge street, {{in the heart of the}} Ghetto, there is deep mourning. Sammy Rathet is dead. Sammy was only seventeen years old – but <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy.</b> That was admitted by the white-haired patriarchs who hobble about with canes while their long beards sway to the vagaries of the wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amichai {{poetry in}} English {{appeared}} in {{the first issue of}} [...] "Modern Poetry in translation" [...] edited by Daniel Weissbort and Ted Hughes in 1965. In 1966 he appeared at the Spoleto poetry festival with Ezra Pound, W.H. Auden, Pablo Neruda and others. In 1968, he appeared at the London Poetry Festival. His first book in English, Selected Poems (1968), was translated by Assia Guttman, (Hughes' lover and mother to his daughter Shura). Referring to him as [...] "the great Israeli poet," [...] Jonathan Wilson wrote in The New York Times that he [...] "is one of very few contemporary poets to have reached a broad cross-section without compromising his art. He was loved by his readers worldwide...perhaps only as the Russians loved their poets {{in the early part of}} the last century. It is not hard to see why. Amichai's poems are easy on the surface and yet profound: humorous, ironic and yet full of passion, secular but God-engaged, allusive but accessible, charged with metaphor and yet remarkably concrete. Most of all, they are, like the speaking persona in his Letter of Recommendation, full of love: Oh, touch me, touch me, you good woman! / This is not a scar you feel under my shirt. / It is a letter of recommendation, folded, / from my father: / 'He is still <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy</b> and full of love.'

2500|$|Sir Reginald Johnston {{arrived in}} the Forbidden City as Puyi's English tutor on 3 March 1919. Puyi had never met a {{foreigner}} prior to this, recalling: [...] "I have never seen foreign men. From the magazines, I noticed they had big mustaches. The eunuchs said the mustaches were very hard and a lantern could be hung at its ends". President Xu Shichang believed that the monarchy {{was going to be}} restored in China sooner or later, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi [...] "subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English". Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read, namely Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the [...] "Four Great Books" [...] of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. However, Johnston disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history. Johnston also told Puyi so much about his native Scotland that Puyi eventually expressed the desire to visit the [...] "Scotland the Brave" [...] that his tutor spoke of with such pride and love. Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy and about what he saw as the superiority of monarchies over republics. Puyi remembered that the piecing blue eyes of his tutor [...] "made me feel uneasy ... I found him very intimidating and studied English with him like <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>boy,</b> not daring to talk about other things when I got bored ... as I did with my other Chinese tutors".|$|E
