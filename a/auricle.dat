5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or <b>auricle,</b> and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E

Ganglionic blocking drugs (hexamethonium and pempidine), applied to <b>auricles</b> which had been previously treated with reserpine, abolished the diphasic effect of nicotine, but did not alter the response to histamine. Dichloroisoproterenol did not modify the stimulant action of histamine in isolated <b>auricles,</b> either before or after treatment with reserpine; nor did it alter {{the response of the}} isolated heart. Diphenhydramine reduced or blocked the stimulant action of histamine in <b>auricles</b> which had been previously treated with reserpine.

25|$|In {{the more}} {{temperate}} parts of its range, A.resiliens may {{be confused with}} ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) and maidenhair spleenwort (A.trichomanes). Its stipe and rachis are darker and its pinnae smaller and more rounded than that of A.platyneuron, which also displays frond dimorphism with prostrate sterile fronds. The pinnae of A.resiliens are more widely spaced than those of A.trichomanes, which also lack the upward-pointing <b>auricle,</b> {{the texture of the}} leaf tissue is more leathery, and the stipe darker.|$|E
25|$|Ear pain is the {{predominant}} complaint {{and the only}} symptom {{directly related to the}} severity of acute external otitis. Unlike other forms of ear infections, the pain of acute external otitis is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently. Pushing the tragus, the tablike portion of the <b>auricle</b> that projects out {{just in front of the}} ear canal opening, also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external otitis on physical examination. People may also experience ear discharge and itchiness. When enough swelling and discharge in the ear canal is present to block the opening, external otitis may cause temporary conductive hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium platyneuron (syn. Asplenium ebeneum), {{commonly}} known as ebony spleenwort or brownstem spleenwort, is a fern native to North America east of the Rocky Mountains and to South Africa. It takes its common name from its dark, reddish-brown, glossy stipe and rachis (stem and leaf axis), which bear a once-divided, pinnate leaf. The fertile fronds, which die off in the winter, are darker green and stand upright, while the sterile fronds are evergreen and lie flat on the ground. An <b>auricle</b> {{at the base of}} each pinna points towards the tip of the frond. The dimorphic fronds and alternate, rather than opposite, pinnae distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed spleenwort.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccessory <b>auricles</b> are {{protruding}} skin lesions commonly {{affecting the}} tragus, preauricular region, and cheeks. Similar lesions, termed cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants, may {{occur in the}} neck; however, they {{are thought to have}} a differing development origin to accessory <b>auricles.</b> Accessory <b>auricles</b> affecting the face are believed to be derived from the first branchial arch, whereas cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants are believed to be derived from the second branchial arch and more caudal-related structures. Cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants occur at a frequency lower than accessory <b>auricles</b> affecting the face, with a very rare co-occurrence. Here, we report the case of a 6 -month-old girl with 4 congenital chondroid masses at 3 distinct sites: the right tragus, right cheek, and bilateral cervical regions. All masses were excised and diagnosed as accessory <b>auricles</b> and cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants following histopathological analysis. The patient had no other coexisting conditions. We conducted a literature search and found only 5 previously reported Japanese cases with co-occurrence of cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants and accessory <b>auricles</b> affecting the face. To our knowledge, this study is the first to present a case with the coexistence of cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants and accessory <b>auricles</b> affecting the tragus and cheek. We believe the occurrence of cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants in this case was not associated with the occurrence of accessory <b>auricles</b> affecting the tragus and cheek. However, an association cannot be completely ruled out as there are cases suggesting an association between the occurrence of cervical chrondrocutaneous branchial remnants and the development of auricles; the mechanisms underlying this development remains unelucidated. Therefore, further reports and studies are required...|$|R

Stimulation of the left vagus nerve is as effectual in blocking impulses from the normally beating <b>auricles</b> as from the <b>auricles</b> when {{in a state of}} fibrillation, and the type of auricular activity has apparently no influence on the effect which stimulation of the left vagus has on auriculoventricular conduction...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the best time}} of examination and section chosen of routine prenatal ultrasound screening for external ear abnormalities and evaluate the feasibility of examining the fetal external ear with ultrasonography. Methods. From July 2010 until August 2011, 42118 pregnant women with single fetus during 16 – 40 weeks of pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Fetal <b>auricles</b> and external auditory canal in the second trimester of pregnancy were evaluated by routine color Doppler ultrasound screening and systematic screening. Ultrasound images of fetal external ears were obtained on transverse-incline view at cervical vertebra level and mandible level and on parasagittal view and coronal view at external ear level. Results. Five fetuses had anomalous ears including bilateral malformed <b>auricles</b> with malformed external auditory canal, unilateral deformed external ear, and unilateral microtia. The detection rate of both <b>auricles</b> was negatively correlated with gestational age. Of the 5843 fetuses undergoing a routine ultrasound screening, 5797 (99. 21 %) had bilateral <b>auricles.</b> Of the 4955 fetuses following systematic screening, all fetuses (100 %) had bilateral <b>auricles.</b> The best time for fetal <b>auricles</b> observation with ultrasonography is 20 – 24 weeks of pregnancy. Conclusions. Detection of external ear abnormalities may assist in the diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities...|$|R
25|$|The {{coronary}} arteries {{start in the}} right and left aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more {{coronary arteries}} that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the coronary groove and continues on into the tissue as interventricular branches toward the apex of the heart. The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right atrioventricular valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left <b>auricle</b> and interatrial septum.|$|E

500|$|While both Asa Gray and Eaton {{identified}} A.bradleyi as {{a hybrid}} intermediate between A.montanum and A.platyneuron, the English botanist R.
