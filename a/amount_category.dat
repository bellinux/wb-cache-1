40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Processamento e Conservação de Alimentos - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaFood safety {{consumer}} concern is increasing, {{which led to}} the implementation of stricter hygiene rules which are applicable to animal products. In this scenario, slaughterhouses and sanitary inspection plays a critical role, since they allow to identify and minimize the specific hazards for human health. Through the assurance of animal well-being and through the ante and post-mortem inspection, it is possible to guarantee that products of animal origin reach the consumer in a safe way. Mainly goals of this thesis were the classification and quantification of the animal origin by-products obtained during health inspection and slaughter operations, as well as the assessment of the economic impact of these products for the slaughterhouse. A record was made for the weights of the by-products obtained monthly through the slaughtered species in Mafra´s Regional Slaughterhouse, bovine, equine, ovine and caprine, during the internship period from February to July 2015. During this period, it was possible to determine that, from the by-products produced over these months, more than 50 % were of category 3 by-products. The <b>amount</b> of <b>category</b> 1 by-products produced varied between 31 000 kg and 45 000 kg, the <b>amount</b> of <b>category</b> 2 by-products varied between 28 000 kg and 36 000 kg and the <b>amount</b> of <b>category</b> 3 by-products varied between 67 000 kg and 86 000 kg. Economically, despite of animal origin by-products being considered just a “complementary” service, the income of category 3 by-products generates a value of 41 709 € which covers the cost associated with the elimination of category 1 and 2 by-products (37 517 €) ...|$|R

Regional and UK average time series of the contribution from the category consisting of the heaviest events indicate that the increased winter intensity was sustained during the most recent ten years, but the trend did not continue at the rate reported previously for 1961 – 1995.

In this paper we present a compact 3 D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for long-term activity recognition in egocentric videos.

Existing methods for this task are based on hand tuned features derived from visible objects, location of hands, as well as optical flow. Given a sparse optical flow volume as input, our CNN classifies the camera wearer's activity. We obtain classification accuracy of 89 %, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 19 %.

30|$|Route {{knowledge}} {{is one of}} the most important skills of a train driver as a considerable part of their movement authority is often hidden from a driver’s view [18]. Taking into account the more closed nature of metro systems in comparison to mainline railways, it is safe to assume that the route knowledge of the metro drivers is at a very high level. This is also supported by a relatively small <b>amount</b> of <b>category</b> A SPaDs in T&W Metro with a considerably higher frequency of the running signals than in the mainline railways. The drivers also believe that they know the system very well. Moreover, involvement in category A SPaD incidents does not make the drivers reconsider their route knowledge (U =  21.5, p =  0.234). On the other hand, the incident data analysis suggests that the increased familiarity with the day-to-day running causes a decrease in drivers’ safety-related performance during non-routine operations. For example, engineering works and possessions affect the routine operation protocols in the system. The drivers’ assessment corroborates a reduction in confidence in such operational conditions.|$|R
