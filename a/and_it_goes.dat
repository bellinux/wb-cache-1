5|$|Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) watch a {{movie at}} her house. She {{questions}} him about Piz’s mood, while Keith enters and says he is currently unopposed in the Sheriff election. Piz runs up to Veronica and states {{that he has been}} chosen to be a guide for a rock star named Desmond Fellows. However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and start to make progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz.|$|E

25|$|The 40/20 rule is a {{relatively}} new rule created to reward excellence in kicking for touch. When a player on the attacking team kicks the ball from behind his 40-metre line <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> into touch between the opposition's 20-metre line and goal-line after bouncing at least once within the field of play, a 40/20 is awarded. The usual decision to give the head and feed of the scrum to the non-kicking team when the ball enters touch is reversed if the kick is a 40/20. As scrums are rarely competitive, a successful 40/20 virtually guarantees possession in an attacking position by effectively moving the team from their own 40-metre line to the position where the ball went out.|$|E

Halfpenny said [...] "It's Amy who takes the lead <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> from there." [...] Hordley explained that Amy's attention inflates Cain's ego and he thinks [...] "'aye, aye". It's still young but in his book, he's like, 'wahey, I've still got it'." [...] However, when he learns she is sixteen, [...] "he feels incredibly stupid and [...] "embarrassed." [...] Cain shows no guilt and orders her to keep her distance. Halfpenny said Amy is not fazed by Cain's attitude and uses the situation to make David jealous.|$|E

'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the first}} two arcade games of the series, players have a power meter, located {{on the bottom of the}} screen. The meter fills up as the player lands punches against the opponent, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> down as the player gets hit. When the power meter fills up completely, the player will be able to launch {{knockout}} punches such as uppercuts, hooks, and rapid punches. These punches have a slight delay in execution, but they cause more damage to the opponent. Players can also build power as the match progresses, as indicated by the background color behind the player's face on the upper left corner of the screen, which goes from blue to green to yellow to red. The player reaches [...] "Power-Up" [...] status when the background color reaches red. During this status, the player's punch speed and power increase. They lose their Power-Up status if they are knocked down.|$|E

500|$|Serious {{development}} of the game's story and concept started in February 2009, as teams were moved from Arkham Asylum to Arkham Citys development as they completed the work on that game. By {{the time they had}} programmed Batman to dive and glide between buildings of the asylum, the adaption of the gameplay to the city was considered natural. Rocksteady decided to not include the Batmobile, because it would be unable to travel on the city's broken terrain. Batman's gliding provided a sufficient means of transportation, and it was considered that putting Batman in any vehicle would make it a completely different game. Sefton Hill, Arkham Citys director from Rocksteady Studios, stated that a key goal for the game was to deliver the [...] "'Batman in Gotham' feeling." [...] The sequel was described by Conroy as [...] "really, really dark". While relating the game's dark nature to the animated movie , Conroy also said, [...] "It involves a lot of the villains <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to that area– it's that dark." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Ensemble had {{to re-create}} all of Bungie's assets from scratch, Bungie had {{produced}} {{a large amount}} of reference material for the Halo film adaptation that the Halo Wars team used for inspiration. Another reference point was art from the Halo first-person shooters; however, as the art was from a forward perspective and Halo Wars takes place from a bird's-eye view, the team exaggerated shapes to make the units recognizable. Lead designer Graeme Devine noted that the Warthog Jeep is [...] "actually jumping three times as high as it does in Halo, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> four times faster than it does in Halo, and all these things—but it looks the same. Very different, between look and accuracy." [...] To ensure artistic continuity between Halo Wars and previous games in the series, Ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow; for example, the Covenant were to retain their curvy, organic look, while the Forerunner and UNSC were to keep the same geometry angles. UNSC structures and units were given a green tint, with gold specular highlights. The Covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern, with small blue lights against a purple base color.|$|E

According to a 2010 study by the National Research Council, {{the cost of a}} lithium-ion battery pack was about /kWh of usable energy, and considering that a PHEV-10 requires about 2.0kWh and a PHEV-40 about 8kWh, the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a PHEV-10 is around [...] <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> up to [...] for a PHEV-40. , and based on the three battery size options offered for the Tesla Model S, the New York Times estimated the cost of automotive battery packs between [...] to [...] per kilowatt-hour. A 2013 study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy reported that battery costs came down from [...] per kWh in 2007 to [...] per kWh in 2012. The U.S. Department of Energy has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of [...] per kWh in 2015 and [...] per kWh by 2022.

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E

[...] Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying, [...] "That was a conscious move by Max [...] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't remember what it was.
