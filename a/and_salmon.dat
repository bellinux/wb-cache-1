5|$|Fishing has {{declined}} in importance, but still employed 345 individuals in 2001, about 3.5% of the islands' economically active population, the modern industry concentrating on herring, white fish, lobsters, crabs and other shellfish, <b>and</b> <b>salmon</b> fish farming.|$|E
5|$|In winter, the {{resident}} bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, {{in particular the}} widgeon and Greenland white-fronted goose. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and otters, mink and fox are common. Trout <b>and</b> <b>salmon</b> are less common in the Shannon than they once were, however pike is still plentiful and attracts many anglers.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{may have}} visited the Yosemite area {{as long as}} 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. By the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3,000 years ago, {{vegetation}} and game in the region {{was similar to that}} present today; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer, <b>and</b> <b>salmon,</b> while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian. Native American groups traveled between these two regions to trade and raid.|$|E
50|$|The Mashel River {{is home to}} {{four types}} of salmonids: Rainbow Trout, Chinook <b>Salmon,</b> Coho <b>Salmon,</b> <b>and</b> Pink <b>Salmon.</b> Of these, the Steelhead <b>and</b> Chinook <b>Salmon</b> are the most endangered.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{hatchery}} on {{the river}} that breeds Coho <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> Chinook <b>salmon.</b> Some number of hatchery Winter steelhead smolts are planted in the river every year. Sea-run cutthroat trout <b>and</b> Chinook <b>salmon</b> also inhabit the river.|$|R
50|$|Trout {{are closely}} related to <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> char (or charr): species termed <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> char occur in the same genera as do trout (Oncorhynchus - Pacific <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> trout, Salmo - Atlantic <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> various trout, Salvelinus - char and trout).|$|R
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, when Swan Falls Dam was {{constructed}} {{on the middle}} Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon, the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon. Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also {{had a significant impact}} on the success rate of migrating fish. Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam, using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams, leaving the Clearwater, Grande Ronde <b>and</b> <b>Salmon</b> river to sustain spawning salmon. Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho, the Clearwater <b>and</b> <b>Salmon</b> River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River. The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped. The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River dams—Lake Sacagawea, Lake Herbert G. West, Lake Bryan, and Lower Granite Lake—have also formed problems, as the downstream current in the pools is often not enough for the fish to sense, confusing their migration routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, <b>and</b> <b>salmon</b> populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|E
5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon that section of route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th <b>and</b> <b>Salmon</b> streets were abandoned and soon removed. Just two years later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} Native Americans and First Nations peoples have {{a historical}} and continuing {{presence on the}} Columbia. South of the Canada–USborder, the Colville, Spokane, Coeur d'Alene, Yakama, Nez Perce, Cayuse, Palus, Umatilla, Cowlitz, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs live along the US stretch. Along the upper Snake River <b>and</b> <b>Salmon</b> River, the Shoshone Bannock tribes are present. The Sinixt or Lakes people lived on the lower stretch of the Canadian portion, while above that the Shuswap people (Secwepemc in their own language) reckon {{the whole of the}} upper Columbia east to the Rockies as part of their territory. The Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin outlines the traditional homelands of the Canadian Kootenay–Ktunaxa.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon {{was the most important}} fish to Willamette River tribes {{as well as to the}} Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught steelhead <b>and</b> <b>salmon,</b> often by building weirs across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place with the seasons. They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).|$|E

5|$|The Bishop's Palace {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} former Anglo-Saxon parish church of Holy Trinity. The primary wing was {{completed}} during Bishop de Losinga's episcopate (1091–1119). Bishops Suffield (1244–1257) <b>and</b> <b>Salmon</b> (1298–1325) developed the palace and its grounds substantially. Under Bishop Salmon the palace underwent ambitious expansion, possibly prompted by damage from the riot of 1272 and his personal success of being elected as Lord Chancellor to Edward III in 1319. The main feature of the original palace was a three-storey fortified tower which was directly connected to the cathedral, drawing upon the precedent of Carolingian imperial palaces. In c. 1858 the building underwent major restoration under the supervision of Ewan Christian. The building came to be used by the school in 1958. Today the building contains classrooms where mathematics and geography are taught, the junior common room (for sixth form pupils) and libraries in the former parlour and undercroft.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of vertical transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) was studied using the eggs of masu <b>salmon</b> Oncorhynchus masou <b>and</b> chum <b>salmon</b> O. keta. One day after incubation, IHNV was not detected from the eggs of masu <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> chum <b>salmon</b> contaminated with IHNV. Eggs just after fertilization, and eyed eggs were injected intraoviumly with IHNV by microglass needle. Infectivity of IHNV inside the eggs decreased gradually {{and could not}} be detected 1 week or 5 weeks after incubation. This reduction rate of IHNV infectivity in the fertilized egg was similar to that found in the mixture with IHNV and the homogenized egg contents. Several kinds of phospholipid, amino acid and vitamin those were components of yolk showed anti-IHNV activity. In the eyed eggs, the embryos of both masu <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> chum <b>salmon</b> were infected with IHNV, and this infectivity increased rapidly and reached more than 10 ^ 6. 5 TCID 50 /fish. The cumulative mortality of both masu <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> chum <b>salmon</b> were 90 %. The rate of susceptibility of hatched-out masu <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> chum <b>salmon</b> fry against IHNV were different, and the cumulative mortality was more than 90 % in masu <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> 20 to 30 % in chum salmon artificially infected with IHNV by immersion method. From above results, we concluded that the vertical transmission of IHNV is doubtful. サクラマスとシロサケの未受精卵および受精卵を供試し，人為的にIHNVで汚染した後の死卵率およびウイルス感染価の消長を観察するとともに，卵内成分のIHNV感染価に及ぼす影響についても検討し以下の結論を得た。 1) 両魚種ともに，受精時に卵あるいは精子が汚染されても死卵は見られず，ウイルスも検出されなかった。 2) 受精直後の卵内にIHNVを接種した場合，サクラマスで 3 週間以内，シロサケで 5 週間以内に全卵死亡したが，ウイルスはサクラマスで 1 週間後，シロサケで 5 週間後に検出限界以下となった。 3) シロサケの未受精卵内容物にIHNVを懸濁した場合，ウイルス感染価の漸減傾向が観察され，セファリン，グルタミン酸，フェニルアラニン，トリプトファン，ピリドキサルリン酸および葉酸にウイルス不活化効果が観察された。 4) 発眼卵内にIHNVを接種した場合，サクラマスでは 7 日以内に全個体，シロサケでは 15 日以内に 90 %が死亡し，両魚種とも一尾当り 10 ^ 6. 50 TCID 50 /g以上のウイルス感染価が得られた...|$|R
