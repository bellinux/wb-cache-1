5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that those from 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would decay through proton emission, those from 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo <b>alpha</b> <b>decay,</b> and those from 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo spontaneous fission. Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting decay chains terminating in spontaneous fission at moscovium, tennessine, or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> chains from the more reachable nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster decay might be a significant decay mode in competition with <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> and spontaneous fission in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E

50|$|The most {{abundant}} long-lived fission products have total decay energy around 100-300 keV, {{only part of}} which appears in the beta particle; the rest is lost to a neutrino that has no effect.

5|$|This decay chain {{differed}} from the previous observations at RIKEN mainly in the decay mode of 262Db, which was previously observed to undergo spontaneous fission, {{but in this case}} instead alpha decayed; the <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> of 262Db to 258Lr is well-known. The scientists on this team calculated the probability of accidental coincidence to be 10−28, or totally negligible. The resulting 254Md atom then underwent beta plus decay to 254Fm, which itself finally underwent the seventh <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> in the chain to the long-lived 250Cf, which has a half-life of around thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|Astatine's <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> {{energies}} {{follow the}} same trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of <b>alpha</b> <b>decay,</b> which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov were that the claimed <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed <b>alpha</b> <b>decay</b> with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E

The {{literature data}} were obtained for UO 2 having undergone accelerated irradiation conditions. The representation of the simulated accelerated tests for the SNF is discussed. The stress on cladding, and its potential implications in terms of long-term degradation, would depend on SNF matrix swelling, gap size, crack pattern and crack interlocking, and friction of the SNF matrix and cladding. Assessments and reviews are made for the observed SNF matrix swelling, stress generated on cladding, and gap size.
