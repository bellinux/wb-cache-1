40|$|Abstract. The gross {{abnormalities}} in {{the intestines}} of 10 horses {{with a history}} ofchronic weight loss varied greatly. The principal microscopic change was granulomatous in-flammation characterized by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, epithelioid cells and giant cells. Mycobacferium <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>avian</b> type, was isolated from the gut content of one horse, but no cause {{was found in the}} others. Horses previously reported to have tuberculosis had lesions similar to those described here. These lesions are also similar to those in Crohn’s disease of man. Although chronic wasting in the horse secondary to many disease pro-cesses is well known, there are no reports of wasting caused by granulo-matous enteritis. There is also little information on chronic diarrhea in the horse [8, 101. This paper discusses 10 horses that had wasting associated with diffuse granulomatous enteritis. The gross and microscopic changes in the gut and other organs are described, and they are compared to those in Crohn’s disease and tuberculosis. Materials and Methods Ten horses with a history of weight loss for at least 3 months were examined at the New Bolton Center clinic in a 2 -year period. All but one were Standardbreds and were 2 - 1 1 years old. There was either no history of diarrhea or one of intermittent diarrhea with semi-formed feces. All the horses were thin and hypoalbuminemic with various amounts of y-globulin and total protein (table I). Cytological evaluation of peritoneal fluid showed little or no phagocytic activity of peritoneal mesothelial cells.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using spatial survival modelling techniques to develop dynamic space-time predictive models of risk for infectious animal disease epidemics. Examples of diseases with potentially vast socioeconomic impacts include <b>avian</b> influenza, bovine <b>tuberculosis</b> and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), {{all of which have}} received wide coverage in the recent media. The relatively sporadic occurrence of such large scale animal disease outbreaks makes determination of optimal control policies difficult, and policy makers must balance the relative impacts of different response strategies based on little prior information. It is in this situation that the use of mathematical and statistical modelling techniques can provide powerful insights into the future course of an infectious epidemic. The motivating example for this thesis is the outbreak of FMD in Devon in 2001, however we are interested in developing more general techniques that can be applied to other animal diseases. Many of the models fitted to the 2001 UK FMD data set have focussed on modelling the global spread of the disease across the entire country and then using these models to assess the effects of nationwide response strategies. However {{it has been shown that}} the dynamics of the disease are not uniform across the whole of the UK and can vary significantly across different spatial regions. Of interest here is exploring whether modelling at a smaller spatial scale can provide more useful measures of risk and guide the development of more efficient control policies. We begin by introducing some of the main epidemiological issues and concepts involved in modelling infectious animal diseases, from the microscopic through to the farm population level. We then discuss the various mathematical modelling techniques that have applied previously and how they relate to various biological principals discussed in the earlier chapters. We then highlight some limitations with these approaches and offer potential ways in which survival analysis techniques could be used to overcome some of these problems. To this end we formulate a spatial survival model and fit it to the Devon data set with some naive initial covariates that fail to capture the dynamics of the disease. Some work by colleagues at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge (Arnold 2005), produced estimates of viral excretion rates for infected herds of different species type over time, and these form the basis for the development of a dynamic space-time varying viral load covariate that quantifies the viral load acting at any spatial location at any point in time. The novel use of this covariate as a means of censoring the data set via exposure is then introduced, though the models still fail to explain the variation in the epidemic process. Two potential reasons for this are identified - the possible presence of non-localised infections and/or premise varying susceptibility. We then explore ways in which the survival approach can be extended to model more than one epidemic process through the use of mixture and long-term survivor models. Some simple simulations suggest that resistance to infection is the most likely cause of the poor model fits, and a series of more complex simulation experiments show that both the mixture and long-term survivor models offer various advantages over the conventional approach when resistance is present in the data set. However key to their performance is the ability to correctly capture the mixing, although in the worst case scenario they still replicate the results from the conventional model. We also use these simulations to explore potential ways in which space-time predictions of the hazard of infection can be used as a means of targeting control policies to areas of ‘high-risk’ of infection. This shows the importance of ensuring that the scale of the control order matches the scale of the epidemic, and suggests possible dangers when using global level models to derive response strategies for situations where the dynamics of the disease change at smaller spatial scales. Finally we apply these techniques to the Devon data set and offer some conclusions and future work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Avian</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} infections affecting most species of birds. Several mycobacterial species have been identified causing <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> and the organisms confirmed most frequently are Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium genavense.

Several mycobacterial species have been identified causing <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> but the organisms confirmed most frequently are Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium genavense. All species of birds can be infected with M. avium. M. avium cannot only infect all species of birds, but can also infect some domesticated mammals to cause the disease, usually with localized lesions. Disseminated tuberculosis caused by M. avium has also been reported in rabbits and swine. In immune-competent humans, M. avium complex) MAC(isolates produce localized soft tissue infections, including chronic pulmonary infections in the elderly and cervical lymphadenitis in children, but rarely any disseminated disease. In HIV infected and AIDS patients, or in other immuno-compromised persons, MAC isolates frequently cause severe systemic infections. The most crucial aspect of control and eradication of the disease is identification of infection sources and transmission routes. The use of serotyping for epidemiological studies of virulent M. avium subsp. avium isolates in birds is limited by the prevalence of only three serotypes and untypable auto-agglutinating isolates. Molecular techniques, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism and pulse field gel electrophoresis, have been shown to be much more discriminatory and therefore suitable for use in the epidemiological study of M. avium complex infections. Materials and Methods: Eighty suspected pigeons with <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> based on their clinical signs were subjected to the study. Forty M. avium subsp. avium isolates out of a total of 51 identified isolates were subjected to the test. Results and discussion: Clinical signs, necropsy findings, ZN staining and molecular identification confirmed that the pigeons were infected with M. avium subsp. avium. IS 901 -RFLP using PvuII was successfully conducted on 40 isolates and produced 7 patterns. The majority of isolates (60 %) were RFLP type PI. 1 and in comparison this type was the most similar type to the standard strain; however, all the patterns obtained in this study were different from the standard strain (M. avium subsp. avium D 4 strain, ATCC number 35713). This is probably due to these isolates belonging to this region. In addition, no common pattern between this study and the only other similar study in Iran was found, and it indicates that the sources of their infection are not same.

40|$|A {{whooping}} crane (Grus americana) confirmed as suffering from Mycobacterium avium infection {{was treated for}} 1 year with daily doses of rifampin (45 mg/kg) and ethambutol (30 mg/kg) and 2 doses of M. vaccae antigen. Remission of disease occurred during therapy; however, recrudescence to active infection was suspected by 10 months after the antitubercular drugs were discontinued when the crane exhibited weight loss and had thickening of bowel wall as seen on radiographs. A second therapeutic regimen using azithromycin was then initiated (40 mg/kg fed daily) and {{was accompanied by a}} second remission within 6 weeks. After 16 weeks of azlthromycin therapy, ethambutol (30 mg/kg daily) was added to the azithromycin to reduce the probability of emergent drug resistance. Three weeks later the crane developed severe hepatic dysfunction as suggested by blood chemistry values. This contributed to the crane 2 ̆ 7 s collapse and eventual death. All tissues cultured were negative for M. avium infection. A severe hepatopathy and chronic fibrosing cardiomyopathy may have resulted from the drug combinations. This case suggests azithromycin as a promising therapeutic agent in treatment of <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and warrants further investigation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesAvian {{tuberculosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important infections affecting most species of birds. Several mycobacterial species have been identified causing <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> but the organisms confirmed most frequently are Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium genavense. All species of birds can be infected with M. avium. M. avium cannot only infect all species of birds, but can also infect some domesticated mammals to cause the disease, usually with localized lesions. Disseminated tuberculosis caused by M. avium has also been reported in rabbits and swine. In immune-competent humans, M. avium complex) MAC(isolates produce localized soft tissue infections, including chronic pulmonary infections in the elderly and cervical lymphadenitis in children, but rarely any disseminated disease. In HIV infected and AIDS patients, or in other immuno-compromised persons, MAC isolates frequently cause severe systemic infections. The most crucial aspect of control and eradication of the disease is identification of infection sources and transmission routes. The use of serotyping for epidemiological studies of virulent M. avium subsp. avium isolates in birds is limited by the prevalence of only three serotypes and untypable auto-agglutinating isolates. Molecular techniques, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism and pulse field gel electrophoresis, have been shown to be much more discriminatory and therefore suitable for use in the epidemiological study of M. avium complex infections. Materials and methodsEighty suspected pigeons with <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> based on their clinical signs were subjected to the study. Forty M. avium subsp. avium isolates out of a total of 51 identified isolates were subjected to the test. Results and discussionClinical signs, necropsy findings, ZN staining and molecular identification confirmed that the pigeons were infected with M. avium subsp. avium. IS 901 -RFLP using PvuII was successfully conducted on 40 isolates and produced 7 patterns. The majority of isolates (60 %) were RFLP type PI. 1 and in comparison this type was the most similar type to the standard strain; however, all the patterns obtained in this study were different from the standard strain (M. avium subsp. avium D 4 strain, ATCC number 35713). This is probably due to these isolates belonging to this region. In addition, no common pattern between this study and the only other similar study in Iran was found, and it indicates that the sources of their infection are not same. In conclusionIt is suggested that more DNA fingerprinting tests for non-tuberculous Mycobacteria, particularly M. avium complex isolated from infected birds and humans, be conducted to find the source of their infections...|$|E
40|$|In 1884, at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Pisa, the new {{chair of}} {{pathology}} was inaugurated and Angelo Maria Maffucci was appointed first director. Angelo Maffucci {{was born in}} 1845 in Calitri, near Avellino, from a farming family. After graduating in medicine at Naples, in 1872, he started his scientific work at the institute of pathology, under Otto von Schrön (1837 - 1917). He was professor of general pathology in Messina then Professor of pathology {{at the university of}} Catania. In 1884 assumed the role of chairman of pathology at the university of Pisa, where he died in 1903. His scientific contribution is recorded in the massive collection of his personal notes, sketchbooks and watercolours. In 1881 he described, for the first time, the disease characterized by an enchondroma with multiple angiomas, known as Maffucci's Syndrome. The most important scientific contribution was in the field of tuberculosis. Maffucci asserted that <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> had a different aetiology from the bovine and human forms. This revolutionary theory caused a strong scientific conflict with Robert Kock. In the last years of his life his pioneering research provided the basis for the following modern investigations to produce vaccines from living bacilli. As a person he was described as brilliant and modest, shy and rigorous...|$|E
40|$|I t is {{remarkable}} how little {{appears to be}} known about the natural causes of death in wildfowl in this country. Fortunately {{we do not see}} outbreaks of botulism or lead poisoning in this country, which might have focused attention on the general subject of disease, but that is the object of this article. Any sick or dead duck found in the close season is sure to be interesting. They are not often found, but {{in the past two years}} I have obtained two. The first, an adult drake Wigeon (1), was swimming on a loch on South Ronaldsay in the Orkneys on 3 June 1955, a very wasted and sick bird, which was killed and found to be suffering from advanced <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in both lungs, both shoulder joints and the air sacs. The tubercule organism was cultured and found to be a typical smooth avian strain, sensitive to streptomycin. On 20 April 1957 my dog found a freshly dead first-summer female Shelduck (2) on the fresh marsh on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. It had been killed by having its head largely chewed off by some animal, but at the same time it was felt to be extremely thin. The possibility that it had been killed in its weakene...|$|E
