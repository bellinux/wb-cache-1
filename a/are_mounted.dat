5|$|All {{the ships}} of this class are built using DMR 249A special grade high-tensile steel, {{produced}} by the state-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials. The main machinery is raft mounted, and each gear unit and its associated engines <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on a common raft. The diesel engines are license built by Kirloskar under SEMT Pielstick of France. DCNS supplies the noise-suppressing raft-mounted gearbox for CODAD propulsion. Wärtsilä India manufactures the low-vibration diesel alternators to power the on-board electronics.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players often {{encounter}} helpful {{residents who}} will {{point the way}} to outlaws. The residents need to be protected during gameplay, as the player has to pay a fine if any are shot by either bandits or Sheriff Quickdraw himself. Some outlaws <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on horseback, meaning that the player may have to saddle an imaginary horse to pursue them.|$|E
5|$|Further {{detailing}} {{depicted on}} the four faces and eight corners, are five kinds of Buddhas suppressing the vicious demons (performing four pious deeds) and placed on thrones that <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> over the stooping demons. The demons and Khadoms are depicted adorned and seated on four petalled and four faced thrones “adorned with necromantic attributes” enjoying a good time; the Khadoms are seen {{on the four}}-sided courtyard of the palace and also on all side walls.|$|E
50|$|Headlights and {{taillights}} may <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the bicycle}} or {{worn by the}} cyclist. Lights may also <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the wheels.|$|R

50|$|Bellerophon was {{the first}} British ironclad to carry the 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading gun. All ten of the 9 in guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on the main deck, five on each side. Five 7-inch rifled muzzle-loaders <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> outside the battery as chase guns. Four of these <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in pairs fore and aft on the main deck; the last gun <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the upper deck at the stern. The ship also had four breech-loading 12-pounder Armstrong guns for use as saluting guns.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E
5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also {{patented}} a TBM {{that employed}} Wilson's cutting discs, although they <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on rotating arms, {{which in turn}} <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rotating plate. [...] In the 1870s, John D. Brunton of England built a machine employing cutting discs that <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on rotating plates, which in turn <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on a rotating plate, so that the cutting discs would travel over {{almost all of the}} rock face that was to be removed.|$|R
50|$|The motored cars <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on DT21A coil-spring bogies {{based on}} the bogies used on the 101 series {{commuter}} EMUs. The non-motored trailer cars <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on TR62 bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{gear change}} <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the {{steering}} column. The direction indicator switch <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> in the instrument panel. The headlamp dip switch was foot operated. The starter switch <b>was</b> push-operated and <b>mounted</b> on the floor panel below the handbrake.|$|R
5|$|The flaps <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane is {{attached to}} the load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The {{time taken}} for a muscle {{supplied}} by the pudendal nerve to contract {{in response to an}} electrical stimulus applied to the sensory and motor fibers can be quantified. Increased conduction time (terminal motor latency) signifies damage to the nerve. 2 stimulating electrodes and 2 measuring electrodes <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on the examiner's gloved finger ("St Mark's electrode").|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the top}} surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5000|$|MR-03 Sports 2 (The {{advanced}} gyro unit (MZW431) {{that can}} <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the Mini-Z AWD Sports, is {{also able to}} <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the MINI-Z Racer Sports 2 MR-03).|$|R
2500|$|A small {{platform}} that carried a [...] rangefinder <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> above the rear torpedo locker and a [...] searchlight <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on a tower behind the rear funnel. The two license-built Vickers [...] (pom pom) anti-aircraft guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on an elevated platform {{at the front}} of the rear funnel. Curiously they were another case where the designer exceeded the requirements laid down by the Navy.|$|R
50|$|The 6.6-inch Howitzer {{was used}} a semi-mobile siege artillery, so could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{travelling}} siege carriage with limber. In addition a limbered ammunition trailer was also deployed with each gun. Alternatively the howitzer could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on fixed bed and ground platform. Numbers of howitzers <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in fixed defences, including Fort Widley and Fort Nelson, Portsmouth which in 1898 show a number mounted.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth {{ordered the}} Burmese Ruby Tiara in 1973, {{and it was}} made by Garrard & Co. using stones from her private collection. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a wreath of roses, with silver and diamonds making the petals, and clusters of gold and rubies forming the centre of the flowers. A total of 96 rubies <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on the tiara; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 as a wedding present by the people of Burma (now Myanmar), who credited them with having the ability to protect their owner from sickness and evil. The diamonds were also given to her as a wedding present, by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, who possessed a vast jewellery collection of his own.|$|E
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
5|$|Police are {{dispatched}} {{to rescue the}} President. However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the top crime boss in the prison, warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage, {{and that he will}} be killed if any further rescue attempts <b>are</b> <b>mounted.</b> Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake Plissken, a former Special Forces soldier convicted of attempting to rob the Federal Reserve in Denver: if Snake rescues the President and retrieves the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a presidential pardon. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture Snake's carotid arteries within 22 hours; if Snake returns with the President and the tape in time, Hauk will have the explosives neutralized.|$|E
500|$|The seven [...] 35-caliber guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{broadside}} pivot mounts in hull embrasures, {{except for}} one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water [...] torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.|$|R
5000|$|Zig (...) and Zag (...) are {{two young}} snowmobiles. Zig is yellow and pink, while Zag is blue and orange. A bicycle bell <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on Zig's {{handlebars}} and a horn <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on Zag's.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the auto}} option, the device will <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> {{automatically}} at bootup {{or when the}} <b>mount</b> -a command <b>is</b> issued. auto is the default option. If {{you do not want}} the device to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> automatically, use the noauto option in /etc/fstab. With noauto, the device can <b>be</b> only <b>mounted</b> explicitly.|$|R
5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP pumps <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{a common}} shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The South African Museum in Cape Town {{features}} a hall devoted to whales and natural history {{known as the}} Whale Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted blue whale skeleton, from the carcass of a partially mature specimen that washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the floor of}} Whale Well to permit visitors direct contact with them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of a humpback whale and a right whale, together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.|$|E
5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, {{to the left of the}} north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side of the altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E
50|$|A small {{platform}} that carried a 2 m rangefinder <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> above the rear torpedo locker and a 90 cm searchlight <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on a tower behind the rear funnel. The two license-built Vickers 40 mm (pom pom) anti-aircraft guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on an elevated platform {{at the front}} of the rear funnel. Curiously they were another case where the designer exceeded the requirements laid down by the Navy.|$|R
50|$|The boost portion <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the inlet}} {{side of the}} {{throttle}} body. It measures air density, barometric pressure, and air flow into the carburetor. It <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> directly in the air flow at the inlet to the throat.
