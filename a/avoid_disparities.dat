It also seeks {{to ensure that the}} custody, visitation and accommodation rights of children in contracting States are respected.Under Article 3, the removal abroad of a child by a parent is considered unlawful when it takes place in violation of the custody rights granted to the other parent, or to any institution or body, under the laws of the State in which the child normally resided before being removed.Furthermore, the Hague Convention lays down a simple and swift procedure for resolving the removal of minors outside their country of usual residence, without exhaustive examination of the dispute between the parents. Rulings on the custody of such children can only be issued by a judge in the child's usual place of residenceMoreover, a best practice guide has been drawn up by the Hague Permanent Office (responsible for monitoring implementation of the convention), to <b>avoid</b> <b>disparities</b> in the scope and level of services offered by the various central authorities entrusted with the task of enforcing the convention.Nevertheless, the legal systems in numerous States which have signed the Hague Convention (in particular the Brazilian legal authorities) continue to consider these cases as child custody disputes, in flagrant contravention of the letter and spirit of the convention, thereby significantly delaying the implementation of its provisions and the resolution of disputes.It should be borne in mind that these displaced children are the main victims in such situations. Their prolonged removal has serious psychological repercussions which may dramatically affect their future lives.There are many unresolved cases involving European children who have been taken to third countries which are signatories to the convention (particularly Brazil) and whose return is being obstructed by poor application of the Convention.What measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that third countries, in particular Brazil, comply with the Convention, with a view to putting an end to these unacceptable situations and securing the swift return of abducted children? ...|$|E

The model parameters calibration and estimation is based on a thorough analysis of real historical data associated to this new department (more than 120. 000 patient cases during its first operating year).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to study boundary-making in {{addiction}} care practitioner’s perceptions of substance use and treatment. The four papers are based on three data collections in Swedish outpatient addiction care: a) a survey conducted in 2006 (n= 655), b) a factorial survey using randomly constructed vignettes conducted in 2011 (n= 474), and c) a focus group interview study from 2013 (n= 30) {{with a sample of}} the respondents from the factorial survey. The analyses show that practitioners tend to draw boundaries between various forms of substance use, with alcohol use being perceived as a less severe problem than narcotics use and requiring less extensive treatment measures. There are also partially varying perceptions in different parts of addiction care. By comparison with social services staff, regional healthcare staff generally see a greater need for treatment, recommend medical treatment to a greater extent, and display less confidence in the possibility of handling problematic use without professional treatment. Despite an ongoing medicalization at the policy level, psychosocial treatment interventions appear to have legitimacy in both regional healthcare and social services settings. Boundary-making processes are also found in relation to the specific user’s age, family situation, socio-economic status and in some cases gender, with young women’s drinking being seen as more severe than young men’s drinking for example. The boundary-making between different substance users may be interpreted as a sign of an approach based on a professional consideration of the person’s socially exposed situation, which might require more comprehensive support. At the same time, it may be an expression of a stereotyped approach, involving a normative evaluation of women’s behaviour as being more deviant than men’s, thereby having a limiting effect on the conduct norms that regulate women’s behaviour and making the problems of men invisible. To <b>avoid</b> <b>disparities</b> in addiction care delivery, it is of major importance that practitioners are given room to reflect upon the assumptions and values that underlie the assessments they make in practice. Combining a factorial survey with focus group interviews is proposed as one means of facilitating this type of reflection.   At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Submitted.

40|$|Legislation {{regulating}} minimum {{sentences in}} South Africa was re-introduced by sections 51 to 53 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 which came into operation on 1 May 1998. These provisions {{were regarded as}} a temporary measure to be effective for two years, where after they were extended from time to time. After they had been extended for several times, section 51 was rendered permanent on 31 December 2007 by the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Amendment Act 38 of 2007. At the same time sections 52 and 53 were repealed by the same Act. Minimum sentence legislation {{was the result of}} a call by the community for heavier penalties and for the offenders to serve more realistic terms of imprisonment. There was also a general dissatisfaction about the perceived leniency of sentences imposed by the courts for serious crimes. During 1996 and in the wake of these concerns the Minister of Justice requested the South African Law Reform Commission to investigate all aspects of sentencing in South Africa. A Project Committee chaired by a judge of the High Court was appointed and it operated from the late 1996 to March 1998. Minimum sentences for certain serious crimes were one of the options to be investigated by the Project Committee. Consequent to this the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 was promulgated with effect from 1 May 1998. The legislature intended this Act to defer criminal activity, to <b>avoid</b> <b>disparities</b> in sentencing and to deal harshly with perpetrators of serious offences. The subsequent amendments to the Act included the granting of jurisdiction to the Regional court to pass life imprisonment, an automatic right of appeal against life imprisonment in respect of a juvenile accused and identification of circumstances that do not constitute substantial and compelling circumstances. Judicial discretion and departure from prescribed minimum sentences had initially presented a problem regarding its interpretation in a variety of cases in our courts. Eventually our courts came up with a clear interpretation of the meaning of the phrase substantial and compelling circumstances. This research project will analyze the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 with regard to minimum sentences for certain serious offences. In the process case law and other literature will be discussed regarding the interpretation of minimum sentence provisions in the Act.

According to WHO statements, the collective health needs and implications of this sizeable population are considerable and different health determinants and levels of vulnerability could impact on their health. The health matters associated with migration are crucial public health challenges faced by governments and societies. The main public health goal is to <b>avoid</b> <b>disparities</b> in health status and access to health services between migrants and the host population. The second, closely associated, principle is to ensure migrants’ health rights, as stated during the 4 th Conference on Migrant and Ethnic Minority Health in Europe which took place from 21 st to 23 rd June 2012 in Milan, where Migrants and ethnic minorities were confirmed a benefit to society. This special issue of the Italian Journal of Public Health include each theme related to the main migrant health concerns such as mental health, women and child health, infectious diseases and workers health and safety. Other important issues are represented by Migrant Healthcare Policies and Inequalities in the Access to Social and Health Services. In specific, Marceca, Geraci and Baglio (Italian Society of Migration Medicine), present a review of political, institutional and social aspects regulating immigrants’ health protection at international and Italian level, highlighting {{the importance of a}} cultural effort, even prior to the organizational one, for identifying instruments for equal policies for health without exclusions. Domnich, Panatto, Gasparini and Amicizia, (department of Genoa University Health Sciences) discuss about the existence of “healthy immigrant” effect in Europe and present contrasting experiences, underlining how the “healthy immigrant” effect diminishes as the time since immigration increases. In order to limit this decline, it is important to try to reduce socio-sanitary disparities (healthcare access, unprotected working conditions). Falzon, Zignol, Migliori and Raviglione (Stop TB Department - World Health Organization-) discuss the main associations between TB and migration based on data from recent publications on surveillance, policy and practice. Reports from different high-income countries with well-performing screening and treatment systems have shown that foreign-born TB patients do not contribute importantly to TB transmission in the native population. Aragona, Pucci, Mazzetti and Geraci (Invisible Wounds” Project Caritas Health Service Network -Rome-) focus on post-migration living difficulties that significantly increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder in primary care “ordinary” migrants. Their hypothesis {{is that there is a}} re-traumatizing effect on individuals who are already vulnerable and with a low capacity to handle resettlement stress due to their previous traumatic history. Fransen and colleagues, (Erasmus Medical Centre -Rotterdam-), explore to what extent midwives experience barriers in providing information about prenatal screening for Down syndrome to women from diverse ethnic backgrounds, and to assess their competences to overcome these barriers. They emphasize, in order to enable all pregnant women to make an informed decision whether or not to participate in prenatal screening, that midwives’ competences to address language barriers should be increased. Four contributions address then aspects relating to health protection in a very susceptible age group: children and adolescents. Buchegger-Traxler and Sirsch (University of Vienna) investigate how do adolescents cope with the consequences of living as migrants or refugees, how do they compare with their peers in the host country of refuge and if there are differences between males and females, in Austrian context. Their research leads to a better understanding of factors determining the well-being of adolescents and contributes to finding new approaches to prevent or cope with mental health problems of young immigrants. Sisto, Gargiullo, Ranno and Valentini (Catholic University –Rome-), discuss that despite of the existing laws and a favourable resolution emanated by the European Parliament in 2011, full recognition of irregularly immigrated minors rights is bound in Europe to each State and in Italy to the legislation of every Region, thus nowadays still separating health rights for regular immigrated minors and for irregular ones. Valentini, Gargiullo, Ceccareli and Ranno present a “Health check-in” for internationally adopted children as a model for all immigrant children validate by National Working Group for Immigrant Children, to check internationally adopted children at their entry to Italy, in order to assess their health status, often poorly documented; they show the data resulting from their experience using this “ad hoc” protocol. Pfarwaller, (University Hospital -Geneva-), presents a review aimed at identifying risk and protective factors serving as a base for health promotion of young recent migrants in primary care. Young migrants’ health was considered good at arrival, but deteriorated with length of stay due to factors linked to migration. Social support and family cohesion were identified as protective factors. Finally Di Pietro, Teleman and Faggioni present the aspects related to classification, motivations and health consequences of the Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), the ethical aspects, the legislative measures and information campaigns brought forth by several organizations working to obtain, within the year 2012, an United Nations General Assembly Resolution that universally and explicitly bans all forms of FGM.

This method addresses three challenges of stereo-scopic image stitching: how to handle parallax, how to stitch the left- and right-view panorama consistently, and {{how to take care}} of disparity during stitching. This method addresses these challenges using a three-step approach. First, we employ a state-of-the-art stitching algorithm that handles parallax well to stitch the left views of input stereo images and create the left view of the final stereoscopic panorama. Second, we stitch the input disparity maps to ob-tain the target disparity map for the stereoscopic panorama by solving a Poisson’s equation. This target disparity map is optimized to <b>avoid</b> vertical <b>disparities</b> and preserve the original perceived depth distribution. Finally, we warp the right views of the input stereo images and stitch them into the right-view panorama according to the target disparity map. The stitching of the right views is formulated as a la-beling problem that is constrained by the stitching of the left views to make the left- and right-view panorama consistent to avoid “retinal rivalry”.

However, it is currently unclear how these conditions affect mechanisms of visual attention considered essential for driving. The present article first reviews the literature to provide an overview of visual attention as it relates to driving. Secondly, the effects of alcohol and distraction on neurocognitive mechanisms of visual attention are summarised to provide a background which informs discussion of selected driving studies. Visual scanning impairment is identified as a consequence of both alcohol and distraction. Thus, experimental studies combining the use of simulated driving and eye tracking technologies are selected and critically reviewed to assess the relationship between eye movements and driving errors as possible indicators of visual scanning impairment.

The reform continues after {{the endorsement of}} Law No. 3 / 2006 that extends religious courts 2 ̆ 7 comptence. Their domains now include alms-giving, charity and economics shari 2 ̆ 7 a. Another legar reform deals with inheritance regarding umariyatain or gharrawain. The Compilation Chapter 178 [2] states that mother along with father will receive 1 / 3 0 f the remaining estate {{after it has been}} allotted to widow/widower. The Bill of Law to be usedas subtantive source in religious courts revises this rule stating that mother will receive 1 / 6 of the estate if the deceased has sons/daughters. Another important issue is that daughter will block the position of the deceased 2 ̆ 7 s brothers/sisters. There is, however, no prescription about this new rule in the compilation or in other legal sources used in religious courts, but one example of this rule {{can be found in the}} Supereme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the appropriate balance {{between public and}} private enforcement of statutes seeking to distribute resources or social services to a socioeconomically diverse set of beneficiaries through a case study of the federal special education law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). It focuses particularly {{on the extent to which}} the Act’s enforcement regime sufficiently enforces the law for the poor. The Article responds to the frequent contention that private enforcement of statutory regimes is necessary to compensate for the shortcomings of public enforcement. Public enforcement, the story goes, is inefficient and relies on underfunded, captured, or impotent government agencies, while private parties are appropriately incentivized to act as private attorneys general. This Article challenges that argument as not applicable to all circumstances. Instead, it uses the IDEA to identify certain features of institutional design that can make heavy reliance on private enforcement lead to predictable disparities in enforcement in favor of wealthier beneficiaries as opposed to poor beneficiaries, in contravention of the stated goals of some statutes. These features of institutional design include universal rather than means-tested service provision distributed by relying on nontransparent, nonprecedential, private bargaining over a highly individualized system where the contours of the right are determined through significant amounts of agency discretion. Where these features are present, the Article argues, greater attention to public enforcement, as opposed to private enforcement, is likely to be necessary if the goal is to <b>avoid</b> enforcement <b>disparities</b> in favor of wealthier beneficiaries. Alternatively, modifying these features may reduce enforcement disparities and make public enforcement less necessary...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how local government planning regulations and charges affect {{the deployment of}} telecommunications infrastructure. We explore the economic rationale for local government regulation of such infrastructure, which we suggest {{should be based on}} managing negative externalities. Using data from Ireland, we find that the observed geographical pattern of impact fees is inconsistent with the economic rationale for them. A simple econometric model of the number of telecoms masts in each country also suggests that the level of impact fees is negatively associated with mast deployment. This paper also examines other regulatory factors that affect the provision of new infrastructure. We find wide regional variation in these regulations but are unableto quantify their impact on infrastructure provision. Such regulatory complexity places extra compliance burdens on private operators, which may in turn distort the level and regional pattern of network investment. We suggest further regional harmonisation of development policy towards telecoms infrastructure to <b>avoid</b> exacerbating regional <b>disparities</b> in rollout of services.

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{testing for}} risk of {{hereditary}} cancer can help patients to make important decisions about prevention or early detection. US and UK {{studies show that}} people from ethnic minority groups {{are less likely to}} receive genetic testing. It is important to understand various groups’ awareness of genetic testing and its acceptability to <b>avoid</b> further <b>disparities</b> in health care. This review aims to identify and detail awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes towards genetic counselling/testing for cancer risk prediction in ethnic minority groups. Methods A search was carried out in PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase and MEDLINE. Search terms referred to ethnicity, genetic testing/counselling, cancer, awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions. Quantitative and qualitative studies, written in English, and published between 2000 and 2015, were included. Results Forty-one studies were selected for review: 39 from the US, and two from Australia. Results revealed low awareness and knowledge of genetic counselling/testing for cancer susceptibility amongst ethnic minority groups including African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics. Attitudes towards genetic testing were generally positive; perceived benefits included positive implications for personal health and being able to inform family. However, negative attitudes were also evident, particularly the anticipated emotional impact of test results, and concerns about confidentiality, stigma, and discrimination. Chinese Australian groups were less studied, but of interest was a finding from qualitative research indicating that different views of who close family members are could impact on reported family history of cancer, which could in turn impact a risk assessment. Conclusion Interventions are needed to increase awareness and knowledge of genetic testing for cancer risk and to reduce the perceived stigma and taboo surrounding the topic of cancer in ethnic minority groups. More detailed research is needed in countries other than the US and across a broader spectrum of ethnic minority groups to develop effective culturally sensitive approaches for cancer prevention...|$|R
40|$|Pay-for-performance rewards health-care {{providers}} by paying them more if they succeed in meeting performance targets. A new contract for general practitioners in the United Kingdom represents {{the most radical}} shift towards pay-for-performance seen in any health-care system. The contract provides an important opportunity to address disparities in chronic disease management between ethnic and socioeconomic groups. We examined disparities in management of people with diabetes and intermediate clinical outcomes within a multiethnic population in primary care {{before and after the}} introduction of the new contract in April 2004. We conducted a population-based longitudinal survey, using electronic general practice records, in an ethnically diverse part of southwest London. Outcome measures were prescribing levels and achievement of national treatment targets (HbA 1 c < or = 7. 0 %; blood pressure [BP] < 140 / 80 mm Hg; total cholesterol < or = 5 mmol/l or 193 mg/dl). The proportion of patients reaching treatment targets for HbA 1 c, BP, and total cholesterol increased significantly after the implementation of the new contract. The extents of these increases were broadly uniform across ethnic groups, {{with the exception of the}} black Caribbean patient group, which had a significantly lower improvement in HbA 1 c (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0. 75, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 57 - 0. 97) and BP control (AOR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 0. 81) relative to the white British patient group. Variations in prescribing and achievement of treatment targets between ethnic groups present in 2003 were not attenuated in 2005. Pay-for-performance incentives have not addressed disparities in the management and control of diabetes between ethnic groups. Quality improvement initiatives must place greater emphasis on minority communities to <b>avoid</b> continued <b>disparities</b> in mortality from cardiovascular disease and the other major complications of diabetes...|$|R
