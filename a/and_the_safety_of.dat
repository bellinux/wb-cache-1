One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot's ease of control <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft by preventing aerodynamic forces from changing the directed positions and {{placement of the}} aircraft's control surfaces. Additionally, {{a large number of}} the control surfaces, such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{revolves}} around a hostage crisis and is largely presented as {{an homage to}} the film Die Hard.

In order to protect Chuck's cover <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the other hostages, Sarah Walker and John Casey secretly go into the store to remove Chuck, but the mission quickly falls apart when Chuck refuses to leave his friends and family behind.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Triple H {{wrestled}} Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. He suffered a storyline concussion and was deemed to have forfeited. Despite being medically cleared to wrestle before the June 3 episode of Raw, Vince and Stephanie McMahon {{did not allow}} Triple H to wrestle Axel, citing concerns for his well-being <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> his children. In response, Triple H stormed out the arena and vowed {{to return to the}} ring the next week on Raw. On that episode, he lost to Axel when McMahon dubiously disqualified him, ordered Axel to leave the ring, then stole the bell and microphone to prevent the match from being restarted.|$|E

25|$|Despite his troop’s {{failure to}} {{overcome}} Hodges’ small force, Humières decided to attack Walcourt itself, which had since been occupied by 600 men. The ground was not favourable to the French – although the defences {{of the town}} were antiquated, it stood on a hill partly covered by a river. Nevertheless, several attacks were pressed home, but the French suffered heavy casualties from the Allied enfilading guns. Despite the losses Humières persisted, and sent a party of Gardes Françaises to try to set alight Walcourt’s gates. The attempt failed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the garrison was assured after Brigadier-General Thomas Tollemache brought the Coldstream Guards and a German Battalion into the town around 14:00.|$|E
25|$|Canute and {{his companions}} gain {{audience}} with the king. When King Sweyn refuses to refrain from attacking Wales, Askeladd goes on a rampage, killing the king and many in attendance. Askeladd is only stopped when he allows Canute to kill him, thus securing Canute's position as king <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> his homeland, Wales. This was Askeladd's plan, all along. Thorfinn, upon seeing Askeladd dying, tries to kill now-King Canute; Thorfinn's sole drive in life was to kill Askeladd and he felt robbed of this right by Canute. When Thorfinn is stopped, Canute decides to spare his life due to understanding Thorfinn's perspective. Canute shows mercy on Thorfinn as the common law demanded Thorfinn's death: he is granted a life of slavery.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, {{if one is}} to {{decrease}} testosterone in male-to-female gender transition, {{it is likely that}} sexual desire and arousal would be inhibited; alternatively, if high doses of estrogen negatively impact sexual desire, which has been found in some research with cisgender women, it is hypothesized that combining androgens with high levels of estrogen would intensify this outcome. Unfortunately, to date there haven’t been any randomized clinical trials looking at the relationship between type and dose of hormone replacement therapy, so the relationship between them remains unclear. Typically, the estrogens given for male-to-female gender transition are 2-3 times higher than the recommended dose for HRT in postmenopausal women. Pharmokinetic studies indicate taking these increased doses may lead to a higher boost in plasma estradiol levels; however, the long-term side effects haven’t been studied <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> this route is unclear.|$|E
