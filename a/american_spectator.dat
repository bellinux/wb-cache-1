5|$|The {{major league}} {{game in the}} United States was {{originally}} targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading <b>American</b> <b>spectator</b> sports.|$|E
5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , comments in The Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E

The <b>American</b> <b>Spectator’s</b> Jed Babbin said Ross had “cobbled together information from irrelevant or financially interested sources.” Two weeks after the original report aired, the network published a follow-up on its website when U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema dismissed the case against MEP without prejudice.|$|R
2500|$|The Bombing of Naco [...] was an {{international}} incident which {{occurred in the}} border town of Naco, Arizona, during the 1929 Escobar Rebellion. While rebel forces were battling Mexican 'Federales' {{for control of the}} neighboring town of Naco, Sonora, [...] the Irish mercenary and pilot Patrick Murphy was hired to bombard the government forces with improvised explosives dropped from his biplane. During the ensuing fighting, Murphy mistakenly dropped bombs on the American side of the international border on three occasions, causing significant damage to both private and government-owned property, as well slight injuries to several <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> watching the battle from across the border. The bombing, although unintentional, is noted for being the first aerial bombardment of the contiguous United States by a foreign power in history.|$|R
25|$|Murphy dropped one {{suitcase}} bomb each {{on his first}} two bombing runs, both of {{which turned out to}} be duds, and it was his third pass before managed to hit anything: the Mexican custom house near where the crowd of <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> had formed.

Among the casualties were a reporter and a photographer, along with many others, but nobody was killed and all of the injuries were considered minor. After realizing the danger of watching the battle from such a short distance away, the crowd dispersed and went home, some to Fry and Buena.|$|R

25|$|On April 6, 2004, he was {{appointed}} dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law. He originally accepted a position at Pepperdine as the first dean of the newly created School of Public Policy in 1996; however, he withdrew from the appointment in 1998, several months after the Lewinsky controversy erupted. Critics charged {{that there was a}} conflict of interest due to substantial donations to Pepperdine from billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, a Clinton critic who funded many media outlets attacking the president. (Scaife's money, however, supported the Foster-was-murdered theory, according to CNN, and Scaife defunded The <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> after it endorsed Starr's conclusion of suicide and mocked a Scaife-aided book.) In 2004, some five years after President Clinton's impeachment, Starr was again offered a Pepperdine position at the School of Law and this time accepted it.|$|E

Before {{the start of the}} Epsom Derby, Sir Martin was the clear betting favorite, garnering approximately $300,000 in bets from <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> alone and going off at 3:1 odds. The weather that day was extremely wet, with the race being run in a slight drizzle. Sir Martin quickly moved to overtake the leaders, Brooklands and Louviers, at a perilous turn called Tattenham Corner. As he rounded the turn, he was crowded by the other horses (possibly by Bayardo), crossing his legs, and throwing his jockey Henry [...] "Skeets" [...] Martin over the rail. Sir Martin was uninjured and continued the race riderless, but he was officially recorded as not finishing. Sir Martin's jockey escaped with a cut forehead from being trampled by the other horses but ultimately survived his injuries. The Americans may have been upset at Sir Martin's defeat, but the ecstatic British crowd soon stormed the track to celebrate the victory of Minoru, the first horse owned by a reigning monarch to win the Epsom Derby.|$|R

500|$|The book's {{environmental}} {{focus was}} also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of The <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> wrote {{that it is}} [...] "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens". Braile agrees that the book could be [...] "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a [...] "Jeremiad" [...] ultimately gave it a positive review. The Guardian says [...] "we learn {{during the course of}} this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth".|$|E

According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to The <b>American</b> <b>Spectator.</b> In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America We Deserve.

Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be [...] "a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional", but that he might not be worth US$50billion. Gladwell chooses his words carefully to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and not just an ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years.

500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of Juárez began {{a couple}} days later {{in the early morning}} hours of March 8. Rebel forces under the command of General Marcelino Murrieta quickly swept through the city, forcing the federal {{garrison}} back to positions along the Rio Grande, adjacent to the international border and thousands of <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> who had formed up to watch the hostilities from the river's edge, windows and roof tops. Troopers of the 7th Cavalry were also present to protect American lives and prevent the fighting from spilling over to their side of the border. Several stray bullets landed on the American side, causing a few casualties, but nobody was killed. The thirteen-story El Paso bank building was struck so many times that the upper floors had to be evacuated for safety. After hours of heavy fighting along the international border, when it appeared as though the rebels would soon be victorious, the commander of the American forces in El Paso, General George Van Horn Moseley, crossed the line into Mexico to confer with the federal commander, General Matias Ramos, to ask about his intentions. General Ramos informed Moseley that he was willing to surrender the city, but only if the rebels guaranteed him and his men proper treatment as prisoners of war, or be allowed to cross into the United States for internment. The latter was agreed upon and by the end of the day some 300 Mexican Army officers and men, along with their wives and children, crossed the border for internment at Fort Bliss. The rebels were now in control of Mexico's most important port of entry, and they intended to use it as a source of weapons and war material and other supplies from the United States.|$|R

60|$|There was an {{industrial}} fair open at Leipsic which {{they went out}} of the city to see after supper, along with a throng of Leipsickers, whom an hour's interval of fine weather tempted forth on the trolley; {{and with the help of}} a little corporal, who took a fee for his service with the eagerness of a civilian, they got wheeled chairs, and renewed their associations with the great Chicago Fair in seeing the exposition from them. This was not, March said, quite the same as being drawn by a woman-and-dog team, which would have been the right means of doing a German fair; but it was something to have his chair pushed by a slender young girl, whose stalwart brother applied his strength to the chair of the lighter traveller; and it was fit that the girl should reckon the common hire, while the man took the common tip. They made haste to leave the useful aspects of the fair, and had themselves trundled away to the Colonial Exhibit, where they vaguely expected something like the agreeable corruptions of the Midway Plaisance. The idea of her colonial progress with which Germany is trying to affect the home-keeping imagination of her people was illustrated by an encampment of savages from her Central-African possessions. They were getting their supper at the moment the Marches saw them, and were crouching, half naked, around the fires under the kettles, and shivering from the cold, but they were not very characteristic of the imperial expansion, unless perhaps when an old man in a red blanket suddenly sprang up with a knife in his hand and began to chase a boy round the camp. The boy was lighter-footed, and easily outran the sage, who tripped at times on his blanket. None of the other Central Africans seemed to care for the race, and without waiting for the event, the <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> ordered themselves trundled away to another idle feature of the fair, where they hoped to amuse themselves with the image of Old Leipsic.|$|R
