Our low dimensional representation of a video preserves the spatial temporal property of a video {{as well as the}} characteristic of the video. Recognizing video events and abnormality detection in <b>a</b> <b>crowded</b> scene is achieved by studying the video trajectory in the manifold space. We evaluate our proposed method on the state-of-the-art public data-sets containing different crowd events. Qualitative and quantitative results show the promising performance of the proposed method...|$|R
