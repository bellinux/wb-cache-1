5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solution,</b> painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solution.</b> This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1880s {{mortality}} rates in lying-hospitals would reach unacceptably high levels {{and became an}} area of public concern. Much of these maternal deaths were due to Puerperal fever, at the time commonly known as childbed fever. In the 1800s Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth by physicians in lying-hospitals. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solution</b> before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%. So {{it was concluded that}} it was physicians who had been spreading disease from one labouring mother to the next. Despite the publication of this information, doctors still would not wash. It was not until the 20th century when advancements in aseptic technique and the understanding of disease would {{play a significant role in}} the decrease of maternal {{mortality rates}} among many populations.|$|E

2500|$|An {{incision}} is made {{to access}} the surgical site. [...] Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and retractors {{may be used to}} expose the site or keep the incision open. [...] The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum. [...] In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in surgery aseptic technique is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solution</b> is applied to the area of the patient's body that will be operated on.Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Two <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solutions</b> were {{investigated}} for {{their effect on}} bacterial growth inhibition. Materials and Methods: A total of 38 patients were included in this study, who visited Daegu Catholic Medical Center from August 2, 2011 to September 2, 2011. Bacterial culture was performed at the pre-scrub, post-scrub, and postoperation; patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to use of povidone iodine (3. 75 %) and povidone iodine with Softa-Man ® as antiseptic agents at the surgical. Results: Comparison between the <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solutions</b> showed a significant difference for the presence of gram positive cocci (p= 0. 034), however, no difference was observed for the presence of gram positive bacilli (p= 0. 838). As the scrub time increased, the positive detection ratio of bacteria decreased (p= 0. 000), and decreased significantly at more than 120 seconds. However, positive detection ratio of bacteria increased significantly at more than 300 seconds in cases with povidone iodine only (p= 0. 014). Glove wearing time did not have a significant influence on the positive detection ratio of bacteria, and no significant difference was observed between the <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solutions</b> (p= 0. 143). Conclusion: Considering the positive detection ratio of bacteria when using povidone iodine only, the appropriate scrub time should be between 4 and 5 minutes. When using both antiseptics, at least 2 minutes of scrub time is needed...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{dermatitis}} (DD) in cattle is {{an infectious}} skin {{disease of the}} plantar side of the interdigital space. The causative agents are bacteria from the genus Troponema. Pathomorphologically DD {{is defined as a}} combination of ulcerative and proliferative changes which reach down to the dermal papillae and stick out from the ulcerous surface. In order for DD to develop, beside the infective agent, predisposing factors such as wet and unclean floors are required. Treatment of this disorder is possible with the application of antibiotics and/or <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solutions.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of topical application of antiseptics in the therapy of DD lesions in affected diary cattle. The applied <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solutions</b> were: copper sulfate (8 %), zinc sulfate (8 %), formalin (8 %), and peracetic acid (3 %). The treatment was carried out daily during the first seven days, thereon every second day for a total of 30 days.

50|$|In an {{in vitro}} model {{developed}} {{to compare the}} efficiency of wound-rinsing solutions, Kaehn et al. compared four sterile wound-cleansing solutions (saline, Ringer’s solution, Prontosan® and Octenisept®) using a wound coating model consisting of slides containing dried blood plasma or fibrin. The concentration of dissolved proteins was measured and the findings indicate that a surfactant containing solution (polyhexamethylene biguanide with betaine) (Prontosan®) was more effective than saline in removing the protein (adhered dried plasma or fibrin). The proteins in the <b>antiseptic</b> <b>solution</b> (Octenisept®) were denatured and became insoluble.

30|$|The {{strategies}} {{used in our}} institution to prevent infection in patients with open fractures aim to promote a healthy wound bed and stable soft tissue envelope. Central to this effort is meticulous surgical debridement with removal of contamination and necrotic tissue.
