5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} represented by <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts {{that can be}} collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} factors {{leading to the}} first {{escapement}} clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E

25|$|The first pojama {{was built}} in 1764 (the same year as the larger version turumas and the {{earliest}} hemmema). It was a low-hulled vessel with two masts, a main and a mizzen, rigged like a bomb ketch with two square sails, <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> sail, and three staysails supported between the mainmast and the bowsprit. The first pojama was 23.8 m (78 ft) long, 5.5 m (18 ft) wide, with a draft of 1.8 m (6 ft). The three later pojamas built for the Swedish navy varied in size from 20 m (65.5 ft) up to 27.6 m (90.5 ft). Its main armament was two heavy guns in the bow and stern (ranging from 12-pounders up to 24-pounders). These could also be dragged towards {{the center of the}} vessel and aimed sideways, though with considerable effort. It also had up to 10 swivel guns along the railings for close-range defense. For maneuverability, it carried 14 pairs of oars which operated through oarpoarts attached to a rectangular outrigger which improved the leverage for the oarsmen.|$|E
25|$|The major {{advancement}} in weapon {{technology in the}} 1690s was {{the introduction of the}} flintlock musket. The flintlock firing mechanism provided superior rates of fire and accuracy over the cumbersome matchlocks. But the adoption of the flintlock was not initially universal. Until 1697 for every three Allied soldiers that were equipped with the new flintlocks, two soldiers were still handicapped by matchlocks: French second-line troops were issued matchlocks as late as 1703. These weapons were further enhanced with the development of the socket-bayonet. Its predecessor, the plug bayonet – jammed down the firearm's barrel – not only prevented the musket from firing but was also a clumsy weapon that took time to fix properly, and even more time to unfix. In contrast, the socket-bayonet could be drawn over the musket's muzzle and locked into place by <b>a</b> <b>lug,</b> converting the musket into a short pike yet leaving it capable of fire. The disadvantage of the pike came to be widely recognised: at the Battle of Fleurus in 1690, German battalions armed only with the musket repulsed French cavalry attacks more effectively than units conventionally armed with the pike, while Catinat had abandoned his pikes altogether before undertaking his Alpine campaign against Savoy.|$|E
500|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops began on lap 199; Johnson stopped on lap 203, while Earnhardt made a pit stop on the {{following}} lap. After the pit stops, Kahne retook the lead. Johnson drove to the track's inside at turn three and passed Kahne for the lead on lap 211 and started {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field. Bowyer drove to his garage on lap 216 for a transmission change because he lost the use of third gear. Jeff Gordon had closed the gap to Kahne by lap 229. Green-flag pit stops started six laps later when Kahne made a pit stop from second place. Johnson took on four tires at his stop on lap 239, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon, who ceded it to Earnhardt two laps later. Martin's pit crew dropped <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> nut which resulted him remaining stationary for 21.7 seconds. Burton stalled his car which required his crew to push him to the end of pit road. An eighth caution was triggered on lap 242 when Yeley attempted to drive down pit road, and Martin was approaching him. Martin tried to avoid Yeley by steering left onto the turn four apron but made contact with him. Martin then spun and went hard into the tri-oval wall; his car got airborne in the process. Robby Gordon could not avoid the melee and hit Yeley. Gordon consequently spun into the front stretch grass but continued.|$|E

500|$|Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle {{with two}} other detectives to {{interview}} Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah she had discovered objects she [...] "couldn't understand" [...] in her house and in Bundy's apartment: a set of crutches; a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house; a meat cleaver, never used for cooking, that he packed {{when he moved to}} Utah; surgical gloves; an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment; and a sack full of women's clothing. Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he owned. Once, when she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, [...] "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck." [...] She said Bundy became [...] "very upset" [...] whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted. Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.|$|E
2500|$|Early K-M20 {{models from}} 1939 {{were made from}} {{standard}} civilian parts {{with the addition of}} military fittings, such as a [...] large 8-inch Lucas DUl42 headlight (fitted with a black out mask), a timing-gear cover with a screw-in plug for access to the magneto drive-pinion nut and special filler caps for the petrol and oil tanks. These early military M20 models were also fitted with a long spiked prop stand on the rear nearside pivoted from <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> brazed on to the rear frame tube. Factory ledgers show that BSA exported K-M20 models to Sweden, South Africa and India, as well as civilian dealers and distributors.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{performance}} of <b>a</b> <b>lugged</b> wheel for <b>a</b> lunar micro rover on sloped terrain by a 2 D discrete element method (DEM), which was initially developed for horizontal terrain. To confirm the applicability of DEM for sloped terrain locomotion, the relationships of slope angle with slip, wheel sinkage and wheel torque obtained by DEM, were compared with experimental results measured using a slope test bed consisting of a soil bin filled with lunar regolith simulant. Among the <b>lug</b> parameters investigated, <b>a</b> <b>lugged</b> wheel with rim diameter of 250 mm, width of 100 mm, lug height of 10 mm, lug thickness of 5 mm, and total lug number of 18 was found, on average, to perform excellently in terms of metrics, such as slope angle for 20 % slip, power number for self-propelled point, power number for 15 -degree slope and power number for 20 % slip. The estimation of wheel performance over sloped lunar terrain showed an increase in wheel slip, and the possibility exists that the selected lugged wheel will not be able to move up a slope steeper than 20 °...|$|R

60|$|The {{boat was}} {{provided}} with a light mast, which could be stepped or unstepped at pleasure, {{and there were two}} stays of twisted leather, one fastening to each side of the boat.

The sail was <b>a</b> <b>lug</b> made of sheeting, oiled, and the boat carried beside a triangular sail of very much smaller dimensions and stouter cloth for heavy weather. She also carried a small mizzen mast and sail. In rough weather the cockpit could be completely covered with a light apron with openings where the rowers sat, with a sort of collar, which could be lashed tightly round their waists. The edges of this apron could be lashed down over the gunwale round the cockpit. When completed the canoe itself, with its mast and sails, weighed but sixty pounds, and could be carried with ease by one person on his shoulder.|$|E
