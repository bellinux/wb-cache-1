5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is {{probably due to the}} infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E

5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low.</b> These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, it is {{theorized that}} {{contamination}} could also {{result from the}} capillary migration of deep residual hyper-saline water and hydraulic fracturing fluid, slowly flowing through faults and fractures until finally making contact with groundwater resources; however, many researchers argue that the permeability of rocks overlying shale formations <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to allow this to ever happen sufficiently. To ultimately prove this theory, {{there would have to}} be traces of toxic trihalomethanes (THM) since they are often associated with the presence of stray gas contamination, and typically co-occur with high halogen concentrations in hyper-saline waters. Besides, highly saline waters are a common natural feature in deep groundwater systems.|$|E
25|$|The Chablis wine {{region has}} {{much in common}} with Champagne province, when it comes to climate. It has a semi-continental climate without {{maritime}} influence. The peak summer growing season can be hot; and wintertime can be long, cold and harsh, with frosty conditions lasting to early May. Years that experience too much rain and low temperature tend to produce wines excessively high in acidity and fruit that is too lean to support it. Vintages that are exceedingly warm tend to produce fat, flabby wines that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> in acidity. Frost can be countered by heaters, and aspersion by sprinklers to form an ice layer. The exceptionally poor 1972 Chablis suffered frost at vintage time.|$|E
25|$|According to FAO, {{water fees}} <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to meet {{maintenance}} and operation requirements for hydraulic infrastructure. For instance, cost recovery {{for water and}} sanitation is minimal. Average tariffs are moderate at US$0.21 per cubic meter for water and US$0.07 per cubic meter for sewerage. In addition, collection rates for {{water supply and sanitation}} are extremely low at only 28%. As a result of moderate tariffs and very low collection rates, according to a WHO estimate in 1998, households paid on average only US$0.50 per month for water and US$0.09 per month for sewerage. Not surprisingly, the regional water and sewer companies and INAPA (the national water and sewerage authority) rely largely on transfers from the central budget to fund their operations. The existing schemes lack transparency and efficiency in the use of subsidies.|$|E

25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low.</b> As semi-arboreal snakes, young boa constrictors may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. Boa constrictors strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, boa constrictors in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Boars of {{all ages}} were once the primary prey of tigers in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to have a {{limiting}} effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, {{before moving on to}} another herd. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for tigers alongside the Manchurian wapiti, with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid's prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30–34 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens.|$|E
