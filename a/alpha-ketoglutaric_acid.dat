5000|$|Cyanidin can be {{synthesized}} in berry plants {{through the}} shikimate pathway and polyketide synthase (PKS) III. The shikimate pathway is a biosynthetic pathways {{that uses the}} starting materials Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) and Erythrose 4-phosphate to form shikimic acid, which then further reacts to form specific aromatic amino acids. L-phenyl alanine, which is necessary {{in the production of}} cyanidin, is synthesized through the shikimate pathway. [...] In the synthesis of L-phenyl alanine, chorismate undergoes a Claisen rearrangement by a Chorismate mutase enzyme to form prephenate. Prephenate undergoes dehydration, decarboxylation, and transamination with Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and <b>alpha-Ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid</b> to form L-phenyl alanine (figure 1). [...] L-phenyl alanine then undergoes an elimination of the primary amine with Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) to form cinnamate. Through an oxidation with oxygen gas and NADPH, a hydroxyl group is added to the para position of the aromatic ring. The compound then reacts with Coenzyme A (CoA), CoA ligase, and ATP to attach CoA to the carboxyllic acid group. The compound reacts with naringenin-chalcone synthase and malonyl CoA to add three more keto groups to the benzene ring through PKS III. Aureusidin synthase catalyses the aromatization and cyclization of the newly added carbonyl groups and facilitates the release of CoA to reform the carboxyllic acid. The compound then spontaneously cyclizes to form naringenin(figure 2). [...] Naringenin is then converted to cyanidin through several oxidizing and reducing steps. First naringenin is reacted with two equivalents of oxygen gas, alpha-Ketogluteratic acid, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase to form dihydrokaempferol. The compound is then treated with NADPH and dihydroflavinol 4-reductase to form leucopelargonidin, which is further oxidized with oxygen gas, alpha-Ketogluteratic acid, and anthocyanidin synthase. This compound is spontaneously dehydrated to form cyanidin (figure 3).|$|E

In general, they are synthesized using either non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) pathways. Staphylococcus aureus produces siderophores, {{of which the}} structures of staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B are known. Recently, the NIS biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin A was characterized. Here we show that, in S. aureus, the previously identified sbn (siderophore biosynthesis) locus encodes enzymes required for the synthesis of staphyloferrin B, an alpha-hydroxycarboxylate siderophore comprised of l- 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid, citric acid, 1, 2 -diaminoethane and <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid.</b> Staphyloferrin B NIS biosynthesis was recapitulated in vitro, using purified recombinant Sbn enzymes and the component substrates. In vitro synthesized staphyloferrin B readily promoted the growth of iron-starved S. aureus, via the ABC transporter SirABC. The SbnCEF synthetases and a decarboxylase, SbnH, were necessary and sufficient to produce staphyloferrin B in reactions containing component substrates l- 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid, citric acid and <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid.</b> Since 1, 2 -diaminoethane was not required, this component of the siderophore arises from the SbnH-dependent decarboxylation of a 2, 3 -diaminoproprionic acid-containing intermediate.

When hypocapnia was prevented, 'severe' hypoxemia induced only a rise in GABA and slight elevations in lactic and <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid.</b> During prolonged severe hypoxemia, the effects on the brain amino acids were maintained throughout, indicating that they are independent from the intracerebral pH which should progressively normalize.

40|$|Xanthobacter tagetidis grew as a chemolithotrophic {{autotroph}} on thiosulfate {{and other}} inorganic sulfur compounds, as a heterotroph on thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid, acetic acid and <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{and as a}} mixotroph on thiosulfate in combination with thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid and/or acetic acid. Autotrophic growth on one-carbon organosulfur compounds, and intermediates in their oxidation are also reported. Thiosulfate enhanced the growth yields in mixotrophic cultures, presumably by acting as a supplementary energy source, since ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase was only active in thiosulfate grown cells and was not detected in mixotrophic cultures using thiosulfate with thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid. Bacteria grown on thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid also oxidized sulfide, thiosulfate and tetrathionate, indicating these as possible sulfur intermediates in thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid degradation. Thiosulfate and tetrathionate were oxidized completely to sulfate and, consequently, did not accumulate as products of thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid oxidation in growing cultures. K-m and V-max values for the oxidation of thiosulfate, tetrathionate or sulfide were 13 mu M and 83 nmol O- 2 min(- 1) (mg dry wt.) (- 1), respectively; thiosulfate and tetrathionate became autoinhibitory at concentrations above 100 mu M. The true growth yield (Y-max) on thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid was estimated from chemostat cultures (at dilution rates of 0. 034 - 0. 094 h(- 1)) to be 112. 2 g mol(- 1) with a maintenance coefficient (m) of 0. 3 mmol thiophene- 2 -carboxplic acid (g dry wt.) (- 1) h(- 1), and the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) was 0. 116 h(- 1). Growth in chemostat culture at a dilution rate of 0. 041 h(- 1) indicated growth yields [g dry wt. (mel substrate) (- 1) ] of 8. 1 g (mel thiosulfate) (- 1), 60. 9 g (mel thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid) (- 1), and 17. 5 g (mel acetic acid) (- 1), with additive yields for growth on mixtures of these substrates. At a dilution rate of 0. 033 h(- 1), yields of 57. 8 g (mol <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid)</b> (- 1) and 60. 7 g (mol thiophene- 2 -carbolcylic acid) (- 1) indicated some additional energy conservation from oxidation of the thiophene-sulfur. SDS-PAGE of cell-free preparations indicated a polypeptide (M-r, 21. 0 kDa) specific to growth on thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid for which no function can yet be ascribed: no metabolism of thiophene- 2 -carboxylic acid by cell-free extracts was detected.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to isolate metal-Schiff base complexes which occur as intermediates in the metal catalysis of the transamination reaction of Vitamin B 6 (and its analogues) and amino acids (glycine and ethylenediamine). Metal ions used were: Fe III, Co II, Ni II, Cu II, Zn II, Cd II and Ag I. The spectral absorption maxima of the complexes have been measured at various pH values using ultraviolet techniques. The infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectra of the complexes have been discussed and assignments of bands are made. Mass spectra were obtained for all of the complexes, and fragmentation patterns have been evaluated. The electron spin resonance technique was applied to copper complexes only, and In each case the "g" and "A" parameters were calculated satisfactorily. In most of the complexes, the ratio of metal ion to Schiff base was found to be 1 : 1, but in a few the ratio was found to be 2 : 1 (e. g. Cu 2 (PLGIy), 3 H 2 0) and 1 : 2 (e. g. Cu(PNen) 2 (SO 4) 2 Cl 2, 5 H 2 0). The remaining positions around the metal ion are occupied by either water or an amino acid molecule, or anions (such as OHÂ¯ or SO - 4). The kinetics of the transamination reaction of pyridoxamine phosphate with <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid</b> and copper II ion have been investigated spectro-photometrically. The reaction products were analysed by paper chromatography. The reaction was found to be preceded by an induction period and to be first order in <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid.</b> It exhibits a maximum rate at a copper concentration of twice that of pyridoxamine phosphate. This maximum is justified mathematically by assuming that the concentration of a complex of copper" and the Schiff's base from pyridoxamine phosphateand alpha-ketoglutarate is very low, and that the complex accepts a further copper" ion at high concentrations of copper II. This makes the ratio 1 : 1 : 2 (1 PMP: 1 alpha-KG: 2 Cu 2 +). The rates of formation of metal-Schiff base complexes of pyridoxal phosphate-glycine with Cu II, Co II, Cd II, Mn II and Al III were measured at various pH values spectrophotometrically. The rates are dependent on the concentration of pyridoxal phosphate and of amino acid. The metal concentration has no effect on the rate, which would be consistent with the metal ion trapping the Schiff base as soon as it is formed. The rate of formation of metal-Schiff base complexes of pyridoxal phosphate-glycine-Aluminium III is dependent, however, on the concentration of aluminium when its concentration is in excess over the other species. <p...|$|E

The major product was pyruvic acid, but significant concentrations of <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid were also observed. Maximal excretion occurred at iron stress levels that initially inhibited bacterial growth; the concentration of alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl at which this was observed differed between strains depending on their ability to secrete and utilize siderophores, suggesting that the intracellular iron status was important in determining alpha-keto acid excretion. However, prolonged incubation of the siderophore-deficient S. typhimurium strain enb- 7 under conditions of high iron stress resulted in significant delayed bacterial growth, promoted by tonB-dependent uptake of iron complexed with the high accumulated levels of pyruvic acid and other alpha-keto acids.

Additional absorption bands of the enolized ligands at 500 to 700 nm are responsible for color formation. Siderophore activity was most pronounced with alpha-keto acids possessing an aromatic or heteroaromatic side chain, like phenylpyruvic acid and indolylpyruvic acid, resulting from deamination of phenylalanine and tryptophan, respectively. In addition, alpha-keto acids possessing longer nonpolar side chains, like alpha-ketoisocaproic acid or alpha-ketoisovaleric acid and even alpha-ketoadipic acid, also showed siderophore activity which was absent or negligible with smaller alpha-keto acids or those possessing polar functional groups, like pyruvic acid, alpha-ketobutyric acid, or <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid.</b> The fact that deaminase-negative enterobacteria, like Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., could not utilize alpha-keto acids supports the view that specific iron-carboxylate transport systems have evolved in members of the tribe Proteeae and are designed to recognize ferric complexes of both alpha-hydroxy acids and alpha-keto acids, of which the latter can easily be generated by L-amino acid deaminases in an amino acid-rich medium. Exogenous siderophores, like ferric hydroxamates (ferrichromes) and ferric polycarboxylates (rhizoferrin and citrate), were also utilized by members of the tribe Proteeae...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of both phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) alone, and in combination with <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid</b> (AKG), on nitrogen elimination via the urinary tract as opposed to the gastrointestinal tract of rats. In experiment I, rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups, (1) Control and (2) PHA, whilst in experiment 2, rats were assigned to one of three experimental groups, (1) Control, (2) AKG, and (3) AKG+PHA. AKG was administered via drinking water, while PHA was administered via a stomach tube. The stock solution of crude PHA in 0. 9 % NaCl, was (20 % w/v) in water: 50 mg PHA/ml, 20 ml/kg body wt. Rats were 7 weeks old at the start of the experiments. Significantly lower daily weight gains in the AKG+PHA and PHA groups (p< 0. 05) were observed compared to the Control and AKG groups. Increased duodenal crypt depth (138 %; p< 0. 05) was noticeable in the AKG+PHA group of Controls; however, there was no significant difference in the thickness of the tunica mucosa. In the AKG+PHA group, the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the granula of neuronal cells of the submucosal parasympathetic ganglia was noticeable, although no expression was found in goblet cells. Finally, significant reduction in N excretion in urine was observed in the AKG+PHA, compared with the Control groups (p< 0. 05). It is concluded that a combined PHA and AKG treatment stimulated the small bowel growth via enhanced epithelial turnover, reduced the N excreted in urine and increased the N in faeces...|$|E
40|$|A {{chemically}} defined liquid medium {{has been developed}} {{for the study of}} the physiology and antigen production of the Legionnaires disease bacterium. The medium contains basal salts, vitamins, <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> pyruvate, 0. 05 % l-cysteine, 0. 05 % glutathione, and a mixture of 20 additional amino acids, each of 0. 01 % final concentration, except serine, which was at 0. 1 %. The medium in shake culture at 37 degrees C with increased CO 2 at pH 6. 5, supports the maximum rate of growth, the highest cell yields, and the maximum cell surface antigen as distinguished by specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody. Studies during the development of this medium showed that CO 2, pyruvate, and alpha-ketoglutarate strongly stimulated growth; that cysteine and methionine were required for growth; and that serine, threonine, histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophane were energy sources. Glutathione substituted for cysteine, but cystine did not. The organisms did not use glucose and polysaccharides, as judged by cell yields when these carbohydrates were present or absent. The chelators malate, citrate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid totally inhibited growth. Beta-mercaptoethanol, thioglycolate, dithiothreitol, and Tween 80 (0. 05 %) inhibited growth strongly or completely. Catalase activity was extremely weak or absent. Morphology varied, depending upon conditions and phases of growth. In general, filamentous forms became chains of cigar-shaped bacilli fragmenting to pairs and becoming coccoidal in the late stationary pha-e of growth. The organism grew at 25, 30, and 37 degrees C. Although they varied in their growth characteristics, 10 isolates were passed for five transfers in the {{chemically defined}} broth, giving maximum rates of growth, cell yields, and antigen production...|$|E
40|$|Maximal {{levels of}} L-henylalanine ammonia-lyase {{activity}} were observed when the mycelial felts of Rhizoctonia solani were grown for 4. 5 days on Byrde synthetic medium containing 3. 5 % glucose and 0. 3 % L-phenylalanine, Differential centrifugation {{studies have indicated}} that the enzyme is localized in the soluble fraction. The time course of induction of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity by L-phenylalanine showed a lag period of 1 to 1. 5 h and reached a maximum around 4 to 6 h after the addition of the inducer to the medium. L-Phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan were nearly equally efficient inducers of the enzyme. D-Phenylalanine was as efficient as the L-isomer, whereas D-tyrosine was a poor inducer. Light, gibberellic acid, indole 3 -acetic acid, and kinetin had no effect on the induction of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Cycloheximide did not inhibit the uptake of amino acids by the mycelia but completely blocked the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into soluble proteins and the development of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Actinomycin D inhibited both the incorporation of 32 P into ribonucleic acid and the enzyme activity. Conclusive evidence for de novo synthesis of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was obtained by the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into the enzyme. Electrophoretic analysis of the purified preparation showed a single protein band that coincided with radioactivity and L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Glucose and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, like citric acid, <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> and succinic acid, and the metabolites of L-phenylalanine, like o-coumaric acid, o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and protocatechuic acid, significantly repressed L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity.

40|$|Amish {{microcephaly}} (MCPHA, OMIM # 607196) is a {{metabolic disorder}} {{that has been}} previously characterized by severe infantile lethal congenital microcephaly and alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria. All reported patients have been from the Pennsylvania Amish community and homozygous for a p. Gly 177 Ala mutation in SLC 25 A 19. We present a further male patient with MCPHA born to distantly consanguineous parents in Ontario, Canada with Amish ancestors. Microcephaly was evident at 21 weeks gestation on ultrasound. At birth, the facial appearance and brain MRI scan were characteristic of MCPHA, with the additional features of partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and a closed spinal dysraphic state. Urine levels of <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid</b> were normal at birth and during metabolic crisis, but were markedly elevated {{during a time of}} metabolic stability. A severe lactic acidosis was present during metabolic crises and responded to treatment with a high fat diet. At age 7 years, the child is healthy but has severe microcephaly and profound developmental delay. SLC 25 A 19 {{has been described as a}} mitochondria inner membrane transporter for both deoxynucleotides and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). The biochemical phenotype of MCPHA may be attributable to decreased activity of the three mitochondrial enzymes that require TPP as a cofactor: pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase. We confirm that alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria is not a constant finding in MCPHA and suggest that a persistent lactic acidemia may be more common. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with severe congenital microcephaly, especially in association with lissencephaly, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, or a spinal dysraphic state...|$|E
40|$|Siderophores are an {{important}} group of structurally diverse natural products that play key roles in ferric iron acquisition in most microorganisms. Two major pathways exist for siderophore biosynthesis. One is dependent on nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) multienzymes. The enzymology of several NRPS-dependent pathways to structurally diverse siderophores has been intensively studied for more than 10 years and is generally well understood. The other major pathway is NRPS-independent. It relies on a novel family of synthetase enzymes that until recently has received very little attention. Over the last 2 years, these enzymes have begun to be intensively investigated and several examples have now been characterized. In this article, we give {{an overview of the}} enzymology of NRPS-dependent and NRPS-independent pathways for siderophore biosynthesis, using selected examples to highlight key features. An important facet of many studies of the enzymology of siderophore biosynthesis has been to investigate the substrate specificity of the synthetase enzymes involved. For NRPS-dependent pathways, the ATP-pyrophophate exchange assay has been widely used to investigate the substrate specificity of adenylation domains within the synthetase multienzymes. This assay is ineffective for NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) synthetases, probably because pyrophosphate is not released from the enzyme after the carboxylic acid substrate and ATP react to form an acyl adenylate. An alternative assay for enzymes that form acyl adenylates involves trapping of the activated carboxyl group with hydroxylamine to form a hydroxamic acid that can be converted to its ferric complex and detected spectrophotometrically. This assay has not been widely used for NRPS adenylation domains. Here, we show that it is an effective assay for examining the carboxylic acid substrate specificity of NIS synthetases. Application of the assay to the type B NIS synthetase AcsA shows that it is selective for <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> confirming a bioinformatics-based prediction of the substrate specificity of this enzyme...|$|E
40|$|To {{prevent the}} loss of raw {{material}} in ethanol production by anaerobic yeast cultures, glycerol formation has to be reduced. In theory, this may be done by providing the yeast with amino acids, since the de novo cell synthesis of amino acids from glucose and ammonia {{gives rise to a}} surplus of NADH, which has to be reoxidized by the formation of glycerol. An industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cultivated in batch cultures with different nitrogen sources, i. e., ammonium salt, glutamic acid, and a mixture of amino acids, with 20 g of glucose per liter as the carbon and energy source. The effects of the nitrogen source on metabolite formation, growth, and cell composition were measured. The glycerol yields obtained with glutamic acid (0. 17 mol/mol of glucose) or with the mixture of amino acids (0. 10 mol/mol) as a nitrogen source were clearly lower than those for ammonium-grown cultures (0. 21 mol/mol). In addition, the ethanol yield increased for growth on both glutamic acid (by 9 %) and the mixture of amino acids (by 14 %). Glutamic acid has a large influence on the formation of products; the production of, for example, <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> succinic acid, and acetic acid, increased compared with their production with the other nitrogen sources. Cultures grown on amino acids have a higher specific growth rate (0. 52 h- 1) than cultures of both ammonium-grown (0. 45 h- 1) and glutamic acid-grown (0. 33 h- 1) cells. Although the product yields differed, similar compositions of the cells were attained. The NADH produced in the amino acid, RNA, and extracellular metabolite syntheses was calculated together with the corresponding glycerol formation. The lower-range values of the theoretically calculated yields of glycerol were in good agreement with the experimental yields, which may indicate that the regulation of metabolism succeeds in the most efficient balancing of the redox potential...|$|E
40|$|Part I of {{the thesis}} {{deals with the}} {{formation}} and transamination of Schiff's base complexes of copper, pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate, and the transamination of reaction mixtures containing copper, pyridoxamine phosphate and <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid.</b> The formation of the complex of copper,, pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate {{was found to be}} first order in both pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate and zero order in copper. Spectrophotometric studies showed isosbestiT points when reaction mixtures were scanned over the range 20, 000 - 35. 000 cm- 1 indicating that only one step is involved. At high concentrations of copper (16 mM) the initial reaction rate became slightly dependent upon the copper concentration, and the initial optical density of the reaction mixture departed from that of pyridoxal phosphate. These deviations are explained by the postulation of an intermediate carbinolamine complex. The complex formed from copper, pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate transmigrated to give pyridoxamine phosphate and a-ketoglutaric acid. The presence of metal ions appears to catalyse the transamination reaction, copper being the most active. If account was taken of {{the fact that in the}} absence of metal ions the Schiff's base of pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate is largely hydrolysed, however, the rate of transamination was found to be less in the presence of metal ions than in their absence. The transamination of reaction mixtures containing copper, pyridoxamine phosphate and a-ketoglutaric acid took place without significant formation of the Schiff's base complex, due to the unfavourable equilibrium constant for the formation of the Schiff's base in this system. Transamination was found to be very much more rapid than in the case of the copper complexes of the Schiff's base of pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate. The transamination of pyridoxamine phosphate and <b>alpha-ketoglutaric</b> <b>acid</b> is first order in a-ketoglutaric acid (tailing off at higher concentrations of alphaKG) and exhibits a rate maximum at a copper concentration of twice that of pyridoxamine phosphate. This maximum is justified mathematically by assuming that the concentration of a complex of copper and the Schiff's base from pyridoxamine phosphate and alpha-lcetoglutarate is very low, and that the complex accepts a further Cu 2 + ion at high' concentrations of copper. The transamination of. pyridoxamine phosphate was found to be preceded by what at first appeared to be an induction period, further study of which indicated that the very small change in absorbance was caused by a rate limiting dehydration of the carbinolaraine of pyridoxamine phosphate and a-ketoglutarate. Low concentrations of carbinolaraine; Schiff's base complex; Schiff's base and carbinolamine complex account for the first order nature of the reaction. The non-zero values of these concentrations probably cause the deviation from first order. Part II of the thesis is concerned with the evaluation. of the stability constants of the simple and mixed complexes of pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxamine phosphate, glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate. The pK values of pyridoxal. phosphate, pyridoxamine phosphate and a-ketoglutaric acid (necessary for stability constant determinations) were found by means of a potentiometric titration method. The stability constants of copper and nickel with pyridoxal phosphate; copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc with pyridoxamine phosphate phosphate; and copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc with a-ketoglutaric acid were'also determined by a similar method. The stability constants as normally defined are shown to be meaningless where the complex can accept protons at p[ligand anion] values of 0. 5 and 1. 5 and results obtained by the usual procedures have been converted to more meaningful results when the pK values of the complex are known. A graphical method of determining the stability constants of the complexes of the Schiff's base of pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate has been developed. The method, relies on absorbance readings taken at one wavelength osly. A graph is plotted of Log(Stability Constant) against assumed values of the extinction coefficient of the complex The intersection of these lines for several sets of experimental conditions gives the required value of the stability constant. The equilibrium constant for the formation of the Schiff 1 s base of pyridoxal phosphate and glutamate, required in the above, was found by the usual graphical method at several pH values. A potentiometric titration method was used to evaluate the stability constants of complexes of the type MPpGg where P and G. represent pyridoxal (or pyridoxamine) phosphate and glutamate (or a-ketoglutarate) respectively, and where p and g can take values up to 2. A computer was used to solve the complex equations which were derived to describe the system. <p...|$|E
