5|$|Buildings entirely {{designed}} by Palladio <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> Venice and the Veneto, with an especially rich grouping of palazzi in Vicenza. They include villas, and churches such as Redentore in Venice. In Palladio's architectural treatises {{he followed the}} principles defined by the Roman architect Vitruvius and his 15th-century disciple Leon Battista Alberti, who adhered to principles of classical Roman architecture based on mathematical proportions rather than the rich ornamental style also characteristic of the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> {{straightforward}} ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features {{than many of}} his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E

Djokovic and Nadal {{lead with}} a record 30 titles each, {{followed}} by Federer (27) and Murray (14). All four players have also played key roles in leading their countries to success in the Davis Cup. Djokovic and Federer helped Serbia (2010) and Switzerland (2014), respectively, win the competition for the first time, while Nadal has won four Davis Cup titles, and Murray helped end a drought of 79 years for Great Britain in Davis Cup competition (2015).|$|E

5|$|The nuthatches <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch {{refers to the}} {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Ireland is {{subdivided}} into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In {{a system that}} developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.|$|E

5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just {{on the other side of}} the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.|$|E
