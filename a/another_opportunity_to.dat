5|$|Once Barroso {{put forward}} the {{candidates}} {{for his next}} Commission, <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only {{had the support of}} the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).|$|E
5|$|There was one driver change {{heading into}} the race. Karun Chandhok was dropped from the Hispania Racing team and was {{replaced}} by Sakon Yamamoto while Bruno Senna reclaimed his race seat after sitting out the British Grand Prix. Hispania released a statement which said Yamamoto was given <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> race after impressing at the previous race and that Chandhok remained part of the team.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} innings, Brown captained Australia while Bradman was absent with fibrositis. The {{tourists}} fell for 331, with debutants Sam Loxton and Doug Ring taking three wickets apiece. India eventually fell to another innings defeat, so Brown {{did not have}} <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> score a Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86, in contrast to his away average of 1,369 runs at 50.70. His first-class batting average of 43.58 for the season was inferior to that of Barnes and Morris, both of whom averaged more than 50.|$|E
50|$|The Annual General Meeting, held in November, {{deals with}} the {{business}} of the Society and is yet <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> for members <b>to</b> meet.|$|R
50|$|Although most {{commentators}} {{agree with}} the emphasis of the decision, and applaud the move away from Stone & Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens the case represents yet <b>another</b> missed <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> issue an authoritative statement on the thorny issue of illegality.|$|R

5|$|In December 1986, he {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Canada with the Soviet national midget team from Ottawa to Vancouver. Nearly five years before Bure made his NHL debut with the Vancouver Canucks in 1991 at the Pacific Coliseum, he played his first game at his future home rink as part of the tour. Bure also earned <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> meet Gretzky, as well as defenceman Paul Coffey, when his team stopped in Edmonton to play at the Northlands Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|After McDougall {{was unable}} to persuade {{existing}} shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the SS Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the SS City of Everett. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, {{to be held in}} Chicago, Illinois, was in the planning stages, McDougall recognized <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> publicize his design. The Columbus, conceived as an elaborate ferry, was intended to demonstrate that the whaleback design would work well in passenger service, and would be able to travel at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer Christopher Columbus as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his first voyage to the New World.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E
50|$|Widener {{provides}} a comprehensive legal education program including offering its students the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work on court cases through legal clinics. The clinics specialize in environmental law, criminal defense, and civil law; which includes family law, and legal assistance on veteran benefits cases. <b>Another</b> <b>opportunity</b> provided <b>to</b> its students is the Taishoff Advocacy, Technology and Public Service Institute which offers an eight-day training program that teaches {{students how to}} conduct themselves properly in a courtroom trial.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|The year 1917 was uneventful for U-17. The {{submarine}} resumed patrols off Albania in January. In May, the U-boat had {{to crash}} dive near Valona when a bomber appeared overhead and dropped its payload. A foray to Bari in July provided <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> attack a steamer, but the torpedoes missed their mark. On 16 August, U-17, by {{now under the}} command of Linienschiffsleutnant Hermann Rigele, attempted a torpedo attack on a cargo ship off Saseno. At the end of October, U-17 escaped damage from a torpedo attack by an enemy submarine near Cape Menders, Albania. A month later, the submarine was once again attacked by air, surviving two bombs dropped from a single airplane.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, Dresden and Leipzig were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, Dresden and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> coal.|$|E

30|$|As future works, {{we believe}} that there are plenty of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> evolve the {{analysis}} of this collected data. One of them is interviewing the topmost young researchers in order to extract some practical guidance for future researchers. <b>Another</b> <b>opportunity</b> is <b>to</b> replicate this analysis in the future and compare the results in order to evaluate how the area has evolved. Finally, {{we believe that}} the methodology and process presented in this paper could be replicated in other areas with the same type of analyses and findings.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, another injury-enforced {{absence of}} Ryan Nelsen {{provided}} <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Brown <b>to</b> once again assume the captaincy, leading the All Whites in their third Confederations Cup campaign and also earning their first ever {{point in a}} senior men's FIFA tournament in a 0-0 draw with Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Luongo {{made his}} third {{appearance}} at the World Championships in 2004 in the Czech Republic. He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight {{gold medal at the}} tournament, beating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. It marked Luongo's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. He had <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> step in for the starting goalie when Brodeur pulled himself out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4–3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland. Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3–2 win.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the chaos}} of the English Civil War gave Claiborne <b>another</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> reclaim Kent Island. The Calverts, who had {{received}} such constant support from the King, in turn supported the monarchy during {{the early stages of the}} parliamentary crisis. Claiborne found a new ally in Richard Ingle, a pro-Parliament Puritan merchant whose ships had been seized by the Catholic authorities in Maryland in response to a royal decree against Parliament. Claiborne and Ingle saw an opportunity for revenge using the Parliamentary dispute as political cover, and in 1644 Claiborne seized Kent Island while Ingle took over St. Mary's. Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support, arguing that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted. By 1646, however, Governor Leonard Calvert had retaken both St. Mary's and Kent Island with support from Governor Berkeley of Virginia, and, after Leonard Calvert died in 1648, Cecil Calvert appointed a pro-Parliament Protestant to take over as governor. The rebellion and its religious overtones was one of the factors that led to passage of the landmark Maryland Toleration Act of 1649, which declared religious tolerance for Catholics and Protestants in Maryland.|$|E

30|$|Since it is {{expressive}} liberty {{rather than}} autonomy that {{is central to}} a liberal pluralist State, this must be reflected in its institutions and the education it gives to it’s citizens. A liberal pluralist government may legitimately engage in civic education but this must be carefully restricted to the virtues and competences that citizens need to fulfill diverse roles in a liberal pluralist economy, society, and polity. A liberal pluralist State has a legitimate and compelling interest in ensuring that the convictions, competences, and virtues required for liberal citizenship are widely shared. Expressive liberty is possible only within societies whose members do not impede one <b>another’s</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> live their lives {{as they see fit}} (Galston 2002, p. 28). Galston contends, “Expressive liberty has civic preconditions—in particular, internalized norms of self-restraint when faced with practices that reflect understandings of the good life one does not share. Fostering this self-restraint is (within limits) a legitimate object of State action” (2002, p. 29).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{identify}} {{challenges and opportunities}} for implementation of sustainability-oriented decision support in product development. A literature review and interviews with field experts were performed. Most methods/tools designed to support sustainability considerations in product development have {{a low level of}} implementation. A lack of the full scope of sustainability and poor practical applicability might be reasons. Implementation could be improved by amending these deficiencies. <b>Another</b> <b>opportunity</b> is <b>to</b> integrate sustainability aspects in methods/tools that are often already implemented in companies. A low-hanging fruit can be to focus on the area of risk management together with defining sustainability criteria...|$|R
