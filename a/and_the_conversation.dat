5|$|The {{adaptation}} to the screen has continued with the trend of including new scenes to flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially seen through {{the point of view}} characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> between King Robert and Queen Cersei, and the young lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted at in the books.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{includes}} {{references and}} Easter eggs, as did Gravity Bone. Films such as Three Days of the Condor <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Conversation,</b> film directors Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino, games such as Zork and , and animated shows like Animaniacs and TaleSpin are referenced in the campaign. Unlike most of Chung's previous games, Thirty Flights of Loving was not framed around a certain musical composition. It incorporates music composed by Idle Thumbs member Chris Remo, while additional audio {{was provided by}} Jared Emerson-Johnson and A.J. Locascio. It makes use of Soundsnap's sound library.|$|E
5|$|While {{the events}} in this episode mostly follow the book, {{differences}} in the screen adaptation include not introducing the council's delegation with Ser Barristan and Lord Renly <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> between Robert and Eddard taking place during breakfast instead of on horseback. Some scenes were also created for the series, most notably a conversation between Catelyn and Cersei at Bran's bedside remembering the Queen's first child by Robert that died early of sickness (in the novel, when Ned confronts Cersei about Jaime fathering her children, she hinted that her first pregnancy, which was by Robert, she had aborted), and a confrontation between Jaime and Jon before Jon leaves for the Wall.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} Rasas in {{the epic}} are the Vīra (heroism or bravery) and the Karuṇa (compassion) Rasas. Aṣṭāvakra's soliloquy after his father's curse (third canto), Kahola's repentance of the curse (fourth canto) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> between Uddālaka's and Sujātā after Kahola's drowning in water are contexts with compassion and pathos. Aṣṭāvakra's determination and resolve to liberate is father (fifth canto) and his journey to Mithilā (sixth canto) are the notable contexts with {{the emotion of}} heroism.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is telling us about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
25|$|A larger {{change was}} {{originally}} planned: Arwen and Elrond would visit Galadriel, and Arwen would accompany {{an army of}} Elves to Helm's Deep to fight alongside Aragorn. During shooting, the script changed, both from writers coming up with better ideas to portray the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as poor fan reaction. The new scene of Arwen leaving for the West was created, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> scene remains, edited to be a flashback to a conversation between them in Rivendell, on the evening before the Fellowship's departure. A conversation between Elrond and Galadriel in Lothlórien was edited to be a telepathic one. Nonetheless, one major change (already filmed) remained {{that could not be}} reversed: the Elven warriors fighting at Helm's Deep, although Jackson and Boyens found this romantic and stirring and a reference to how, in the Appendices of The Return of the King, Galadriel and the Elves of Lothlórien, and Thranduil of Mirkwood were first attacked by an army out of Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and then later counter-attacked and assaulted the fortress itself.|$|E

25|$|Laurents {{was soon}} hired {{to write the}} {{screenplay}} for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film The Painted Veil for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage {{on the front pages}} of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework East Side Story and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for The King and I, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of The Painted Veil replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical.|$|E
500|$|Milk's {{reception}} by the gay {{political establishment}} in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then {{been active in}} gay politics for 10 years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, [...] "There's an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs." [...] Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> {{marked the beginning of}} an antagonistic relationship between the [...] "Alice" [...] Club and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E

500|$|According to Heather Phares of AllMusic, [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Price of Gas" [...] {{exemplify the}} {{political}} undercurrent on Silent Alarm, the latter including the explicit chant [...] "War/ War/ War/ War". [...] "Helicopter" [...] focuses in equal measure on America's [...] "red states" [...] and on UK apathy and [...] "the people queueing for the McDonald's by [...] house". [...] "Positive Tension" [...] concerns boredom and its dangers, focusing {{on how it}} [...] "can lead you into dark places", while [...] "Banquet" [...] details [...] "how sex is about power, submission, domination and real rapacious desire". The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "She's Hearing Voices", [...] "Red pill / Blue pill / Milk of amnesia", are {{in reference to the}} medications a friend of Okereke's took to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia. The lyricist has described the moment in [...] "This Modern Love" [...] when the backing vocals enter the mix before the second chorus as [...] "perfect", because it evokes the idea of [...] "two people on the telephone, who can't touch each other, and as the song <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> progress, everything amplifies".|$|E

2500|$|Peter Spence {{first thought}} of the idea behind To the Manor Born in the early 1970s {{when he was working}} for BBC Radio as a gag writer. One of the {{programmes}} that Spence wrote for featured a Cockney comedian, who had recently bought a manor house in an English country village. When holding a housewarming party, the comedian invited the previous occupant, a widow who could not afford to keep the house up and had moved to a smaller house in the village. The comedian's account of the lady, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> he had with her, Spence later described as a [...] "perfect description" [...] of Audrey.|$|E
2500|$|Butler was {{scheduled}} to have made his directorial debut in January 1979 with Adrift & Beyond, but it never came to fruition. Butler turned down Coppola's offer to direct the photography for Apocalypse Now (1979). Butler has worked in films during the 2000s, such as Frailty (2002) and Funny Money (2006). Bill Paxton, {{the director of the}} former film, said, [...] "I was excited when Bill Butler who was the cinematographer on such classic films as Jaws <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Conversation</b> came aboard as my director of photography for Frailty. And I really picked his brain, always asking 'how did you do this shot?' and 'how did you figure that out?'" [...] Bill Butler recounts his initial conversations with Paxton about the script: [...] "I liked the direction he wanted to take, and he inspired me to share his vision. It was a great collaboration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel {{preferred}} {{scenes that}} could simply be pieced together end-to-end in the editing room, resulting in long, mobile, wide shots which followed {{the action of}} the scene. [...] Filmmaker Patricia Gruben has attributed this procedure to a long-standing strategy on Buñuel's part intended to thwart external interference: [...] "he would make the whole scene in long four-minute dolly shots so the producers couldn't cut it". [...] Examples are especially present in his French films. For example, at the ski resort's restaurant in Belle de jour, Séverin, Pierre, and Henri converse at a table. Buñuel cuts away from their conversation to two young women, who walk down a few steps and proceed through the restaurant, passing behind Séverin, Pierre, and Henri, at which point the camera stops and the young women walk out of frame. Henri then comments on the women <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> at the table progresses from there.|$|E

2500|$|Following the show's number, title, {{sponsors}} and theme tune, Leo Laporte typically begins {{an episode of}} TWiT by introducing the week's panelists, allowing each of them to discuss his or her recent projects or work. The main portion of the show consists of a round-table discussion and debate, pegged loosely to a selection of the week's major technology headlines. The format of the show encourages spontaneity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> often diverges wildly from technology topics. This causes the length of each episode to vary, sometimes considerably, from show to show, although most episodes run approximately two hours. Each episode typically features three or four commercial breaks, usually {{in the form of}} a [...] "live read" [...] from Laporte that may include interaction with the panelists (e.g., Laporte usually prompts guests for recommended audiobooks during spots for frequent advertiser Audible.com). The show closes with each panelist giving a personal [...] "plug" [...] for their affiliated website or Twitter account.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the title}} novella, [...] "In a Free State", two young {{expatriate}} Europeans drive across an African country, which remains nameless but which offers clues of Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. [...] The novella speaks to many themes. [...] The colonial era ends and Africans govern themselves. [...] Political chaos, frequently violent, takes hold in newly decolonized countries. [...] Young, idealistic, expatriate whites {{are attracted to}} these countries, seeking expanded moral and sexual freedoms. [...] They are rootless, their bonds with the land tenuous; at the slightest danger they leave. [...] The older, conservative, white settlers, by contrast, are committed to staying, {{even in the face}} of danger. [...] The young expatriates, though liberal, can be racially prejudiced. [...] The old settlers, unsentimental, sometimes brutal, can show compassion. [...] The young, engrossed in narrow preoccupations, are uncomprehending of the dangers that surround them. [...] The old are knowledgeable, armed, and ready to defend themselves. [...] The events unfolding along the car trip <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> during it become the means of exploring these themes.|$|E

A Mayday was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. Estonia directed a call to Silja Europa and only after making contact with her did the radio operator utter the word [...] "Mayday". In English, the radio operator on Silja Europa, chief mate Teijo Seppelin replied: [...] "Estonia, are you calling mayday?" [...] After that, the voice of Andres Tammes took over on Estonia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> shifted to Finnish. Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but due to loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat. Some minutes later power returned (or, somebody on the bridge managed to lower himself to the starboard side of the bridge to check the marine GPS, which will display the ship's position even in blackout conditions), and the Estonia was able to radio their position to Silja Europa and Mariella.
