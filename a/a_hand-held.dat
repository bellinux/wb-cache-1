5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding <b>a</b> <b>hand-held</b> bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. <b>A</b> <b>hand-held</b> camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E

5|$|The CS spray used {{by police}} forces {{is in the}} form of <b>a</b> <b>hand-held</b> aerosol {{canister}} containing a 5% solution of CS dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone and propelled by pressurized nitrogen.

The liquid stream is directed where the user points the canister, being accurate up to 4 metres. They are also trained in helping the incapacitated person recover once successfully restrained.|$|E
5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with <b>a</b> <b>hand-held</b> device.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot over {{eighteen}} days in April 2005. It was filmed {{on location in}} Echo Park inside Glatzer and Westmoreland's house and in three houses on their block that their neighbors allowed them to use for little or no money. Many of Glatzer and Westmoreland's Echo Park neighbors also stood in as extras. Due to California's child labor laws, they could only film with the underage cast members for six hours a day, so cinematographer Eric Steelberg used <b>a</b> <b>hand-held</b> camera with few accessories to maximize the time they could spend filming. Steelberg filmed the project in high-definition video format, which was converted to film during post-production. The film's soundtrack included reggaeton songs as well as music composed by Westmoreland's brother as a favor since the filmmakers could afford little else. Robin Katz finished editing the film in August 2005.|$|E

5|$|The second {{schedule}} commenced in Manali in late March 2014, after Chopra {{finished her}} other film commitments. Before filming, Chopra had to re-train herself to build muscles. Bhansali planned an elaborate schedule for her, which {{would ensure that}} her physicality and agility were suitable enough for the role. While filming a sequence in a marketplace, more than ten thousand people gathered on the sets. Due to limited security arrangements, the crowds became uncontrollable in what was not {{believed to be a}} heavily populated area. When Chopra stepped out of her van, some fans tried to approach her, causing the general loss of control. As a result, the shoot was cancelled and the whole crew had to leave. Filming in Manali continued till early April 2014, before shifting to Dharamsala. While filming fight sequence in Dharamsala, Chopra suffered an eye injury, which the makeup team exaggerated for effect. The filming in Dharamsala continued till 19 April 2014. Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara used <b>a</b> <b>hand-held</b> camera during the shooting of the film. The filming was done in 57 days over the course of two years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a mobile camera localization {{system that is}} able to accurately estimate the pose of <b>an</b> <b>hand-held</b> camera inside <b>a</b> known urban environment. The work leverages on a precomputed 3 D structure obtained by a hierarchical Structure from Motion pipeline to compute the 2 D- 3 D correspondences needed to orient the camera. The hierarchical cluster structure, given by the SfM, guides the localization process providing accurate and reliable features matching. Experiments in outdoor challenging environments demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} method compared to a standard image retrieval approach...|$|R
