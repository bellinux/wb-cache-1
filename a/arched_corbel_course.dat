50|$|A <b>corbel</b> <b>arch</b> (or <b>corbeled</b> / <b>corbelled</b> <b>arch)</b> is an arch-like {{construction}} {{method that}} uses the architectural technique of corbeling to span a space or void in a structure, such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a bridge. A corbel vault uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building's roof.|$|R

5000|$|The candi or {{temples of}} Indonesia which are {{constructed}} between 8th to 15th century, are {{made use of}} <b>corbel</b> <b>arch</b> technique to create a span opening for gate or inner chamber of the temple. The notable example of <b>corbel</b> <b>arch</b> in Indonesian classic temple architecture is the arches of Borobudur.

50|$|The Iron River {{bridge is}} a filled {{spandrel}} arch bridge 55 ft long and 75 ft wide, with a roadway width of 45 ft. It has a tapered ring <b>arch,</b> <b>corbeled</b> {{slightly from the}} spandrel. Concrete guardrails with incised panels are on each side. The bridge is in essentially unaltered condition.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{particularly}} notable for {{the discovery of}} a <b>corbelled</b> <b>arch,</b> an innovation generally attributed the Maya. Whether the <b>corbelled</b> <b>arch</b> was independently developed in Guerrero or was imported from the Maya regions is still unsettled.|$|R
50|$|Superadobe {{is a form}} of earthbag {{construction}} that was developed by Iranian architect Nader Khalili. The technique uses layered long fabric tubes or bags filled with adobe to form a compression structure. The resulting beehive shaped structures employs <b>corbelled</b> <b>arches,</b> <b>corbelled</b> domes, and vaults to create single and double-curved shells that are strong and aesthetically pleasing. It has received growing interest for the past two decades in the natural building and sustainability movements.|$|R
50|$|The front, {{side walls}} and apse of the edifice consist of {{successive}} horizontal <b>corbelled</b> <b>courses</b> of huge rectangular or square limestone blocks dressed {{with a hammer}} and fitted together without mortar, with an all-round foundation course of blocks of even greater size laid on edge.|$|R
25|$|An arcade gate {{provides}} {{access to}} the compound and rectangular prison block tower, reinforced with watchtowers on its apexes, with a protected entrance via a patio. An arched door gives access to the buildings and the donjon, reinforced by square towers in wedge-shapes, with access protected by machicolations (providing coverage from three-floors) and is topped by a cradle vault, sectioned into four branches by <b>arched</b> <b>corbels.</b> The turrets are finished in small canonical cones with gables.|$|R

50|$|Described at {{the time}} of its {{completion}} as being built in a style of architecture based on early Italian, the church has a form and architectural features that are associated with the Romanesque revival but includes a variety of details drawn from other styles. The most characteristic feature of Romanesque architecture is the use of the round arch. Other distinguishing motifs that are used at St Mary's include the wheel or rose window, a frieze that contains a blind arcade, string courses and a type of <b>arched</b> <b>corbel</b> motif known as mock machicolation.|$|R
5000|$|First Baptist Church is a {{historic}} Baptist church at 813 Market Street in Parkersburg, Wood County, West Virginia. It was built in 1871, and is a two-story, three by six-bay, brick church in the Italianate style, which was popular at the time. It has a central steeple on the front facade and several rear additions. It is topped by a gable roof trimmed by an <b>arched</b> <b>corbel</b> table and corner turret. This congregation was founded in 1817 and built their first church in 1837. First Baptist was built on that site.|$|R

50|$|Hartsville Armory is a {{historic}} National Guard armory located at Hartsville, Darlington County, South Carolina. It was built in 1939 - 1940, by the Works Progress Administration and designed by architect Heyward S. Singley (1902 - 1959) of Columbia, South Carolina. It is a two-story, 21 bay wide, rectangular brick Art Moderne style building. It has a flat roof behind stepped and overlaid parapets with a rat-tooth <b>corbeled</b> <b>course</b> and cast stone coping.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the apex}} of the {{building}} is a low pitched, triangular parapet/pediment. A central raised shield above the parapet is etched with the date [...] "1900" [...] as well as the Masonic emblem. Around the pediment is more ivory brick work, dentils and three <b>corbelled</b> <b>courses.</b> Dangling from the second story of the building, above the door, is a milk glass globe sign emblazoned with the lodge number, the Masonic symbol and a building dedication.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{recent work}} by {{engineer}} James O'Kon suggests the Mesoamerican [...] "arch" [...] is technically not a <b>corbelled</b> <b>arch</b> {{at all but}} a trapezium truss system. Moreover, unlike a <b>corbelled</b> <b>arch,</b> it does not rely on overlapping layers of blocks but cast-in-place concrete often supported by timber thrust beams. Computer analysis reveals this to be structurally superior to a curved arch ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>corbel</b> <b>arch</b> is {{constructed}} by offsetting successive courses of stone (or brick) at the springline {{of the walls}} so that they project towards the archway's center from each supporting side, until the courses meet {{at the apex of}} the archway (often, the last gap is bridged with a flat stone). For a corbeled vault covering the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls.Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design, <b>corbeled</b> <b>arches</b> are not entirely self-supporting structures, and the <b>corbeled</b> <b>arch</b> is sometimes termed a [...] "false arch" [...] for this reason. Unlike [...] "true" [...] arches, not all of the structure's tensile stresses caused by the weight of the superstructure are transformed into compressive stresses. <b>Corbel</b> <b>arches</b> and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of other stone or fill to counteract the effects of gravity, which otherwise would tend to collapse each side of the archway inwards.|$|R
