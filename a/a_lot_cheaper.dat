25|$|The Miami area {{is known}} for its high level of {{automobile}} dependency and lack of public transportation, which has led to an increasing traffic problem throughout the county. Nearly 20% of household income is spent on transportation and Miami had the most decentralized office space of any metropolitan area in the United States, according to a study in 2000. Despite overwhelming support for public transportation to be funded in place of several new highways in the 1970s, Miami's Metrorail system was not functional until 1984 and as of 2014 has failed to reach the scope which was promised over 30 years ago. Ridership was very low in the early years, averaging less than 10,000 riders per day. The system was not finished, even after nearly US$1 billion in federal subsidies, meaning that approximately US$100,000 was spent for each passenger. This led to criticism from then President Ronald Reagan, who stated {{that it would have been}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> to buy everyone a limousine. Those supporting mass transit argued that the low ridership was due to the system being incomplete and not going where people needed it to, and noted that within a few years ridership was nearing 50,000 per day. Many of Miami and Florida's politicians have not been advocates of alternative transportation. For example, both state governors Jeb Bush and Rick Scott denied funding for an intercity high-speed rail system in Florida. Two state senators tried to force Scott to accept the funding, but the Florida Supreme Court denied the case and the funding was later directed to several other rail projects across the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{walls of}} the {{building}} are faced with blue tiles from Kittanning. Mr. Clifford McNees, who {{was the president of}} the Kittanning Tile and Brick Company at the time when Mt. St. Peter bought the tile, sold the tiles for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than normal price. He felt {{that it would not be}} fair to take advantage of a church by charging high prices. Another man who helped save the parish money in the constructing of the school was parishioner Luigi Valle. He advised the workers on how to set the tiles for many days while refusing to be paid for his services. Valle died in his early 40s, before the tile laying was completed. His place was taken by Bruno Regoli and two of his sons, Bruno, Jr. and John. [...] (John would later become a priest of Mt. St. Peter Parish.) [...] The three men faced the entire third floor with tile, a job that took them more than a month to complete.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} get {{from one place to}} another, people can either use a service or taxis. A [...] "service" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a [...] "taxi" [...] as the {{passenger}} would be sharing the cab in the first place unlike the latter, where he would have the cab to himself.|$|E
5000|$|In Argentina {{this form}} of robbery {{increased}} by 118% between the years 2008 and 2009, possibly because motorbikes have become <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> and more accessible to the public.

5000|$|During {{its heyday}} [...] "Nero" [...] {{was the most}} popular Flemish comic strip, second only to Suske en Wiske. The albums sold well, also because they were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than their main rival.

50|$|The radio {{spectrum}} scope (also radio panoramic receiver, panoramic adapter, pan receiver, pan adapter, panadapter, panoramic radio spectroscope, panoramoscope, panalyzor and band scope) {{was invented by}} Marcel Wallace and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more radio bands - e.g. shortwave bands. A spectrum scope is normally <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a spectrum analyzer, because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the American {{equivalent}} (Florida Cow Whip {{which is}} made of inexpensive nylon) an Australian stockwhip is usually made of redhide or sometimes greenhide leather but can also be made of kangaroo hide. Because a kangaroo is a native animal, and cattle are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> and abundant, kangaroo hide stockwhips are more expensive. Only the most expensive whips are made from kangaroo hide and they often have a fully plaited handle. Kangaroo hide allows the whip maker to produce the fine plaits for which the kangaroo leather stockwhip is renowned.|$|E

50|$|In {{the course}} {{of the first half of}} the 20th century the {{shipping}} companies faced growing competition from the railways and especially the truck. Owning and operating a truck is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a steam (later motor) vessel. Also, ships need additional last mile transportation, which a truck does by itself. The competitive edge of the truck became painfully clear during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After 1933 the number of shipping companies and shipping lines were declining fast. Some of them started to offer trucking services, even in competition with their own shipping lines.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the advent}} of Parcel Post in 1913, after some adults sent their {{children}} in the mails with postage affixed to clothing the U.S. Postmaster General issued regulations barring such shipment. The theory was that children were under the 50 lb. weight limit, and that it was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> to mail them than to pay rail fares. In part, the regulation followed a letter inquiring as to whether parcel post would be appropriate, and the Postmaster General was of the opinion that children were not within the definition of [...] "bees and bugs", which were the only fauna permitted to be mailed. Nevertheless, several children were actually mailed. On 13 June 1920, sending children by Parcel Post was officially forbidden. Thereafter, a mail bag stuffed with a child was prominently featured in a humorous photograph to illustrate the prohibition.|$|E
