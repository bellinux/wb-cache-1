5000|$|Pressure-sensitive {{adhesives}} (PSA) form a bond by {{the application}} of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the <b>adherend.</b> They are designed to have a balance between flow and resistance to flow. The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow (i.e., [...] "wet") to the <b>adherend.</b> The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress {{is applied to the}} bond. Once the adhesive and the <b>adherend</b> are in close proximity, molecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces, become involved in the bond, contributing significantly to its ultimate strength.|$|E
5000|$|Fracture {{can also}} {{occur in the}} <b>adherend</b> if the {{adhesive}} is tougher than the <b>adherend.</b> In this case, the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and remnants of the other. For example, when one removes a price label, the adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface. This is cohesive failure. If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed. Another example is when someone tries to pull apart Oreo cookies and all the filling remains on one side; this is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.|$|E
50|$|Adhesives may be broadly {{divided in}} two classes: {{structural}} and pressure-sensitive. To form a permanent bond, structural adhesives harden via {{processes such as}} evaporation of solvent (for example, white glue), reaction with UV radiation (as in dental adhesives), chemical reaction (such as two part epoxy), or cooling (as in hot melt). In contrast, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form a bond simply by the application of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the <b>adherend.</b> Pressure-sensitive adhesives are designed with a balance between flow and resistance to flow. The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow, or wet, the <b>adherend.</b> The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress {{is applied to the}} bond. Once the adhesive and the <b>adherend</b> are in proximity, there are also molecular interactions such as van der Waals forces involved in the bond, which contribute significantly to the ultimate bond strength. PSAs exhibit viscoelastic (viscous and elastic) properties, both of which are used for proper bonding.|$|E
30|$|Also to be {{considered}} is {{the influence of the}} heat resulting from the exothermic reaction. The more PUR is injected in relation to the <b>adherends</b> surface through which heat can be dissipated, the lower the influence of the <b>adherends</b> temperature. The influence of the <b>adherends</b> temperature also decreases in the case of faster-curing PUR systems, such as the 2 C PUR 2 material, where the difference is very small at the various <b>adherends</b> temperatures. The material can also react faster on <b>adherends</b> with lower thermal conductivity. An example would be fiber-reinforced plastics in comparison to aluminum.|$|R
30|$|An {{aluminum}} alloy (5052 -H 34, average thickness =  3.0  mm), a GF/PP matrix composite (Tepex dynalite 104 -RG 600 (6)/ 47  %, average thickness =  3.0  mm, produced by Bond Laminates, Germany), and a CF/EP matrix composite (F 6343 B- 05 P (0 / 90) 14, average thickness =  3.3  mm, produced by Toray Industries Inc., Japan) {{were used for}} the <b>adherends.</b> A two-part acrylic-based adhesive (3  M™ Scotch-Weld™ Structural Plastic Adhesive DP 8005, Japan) was used to bond the <b>adherends.</b> The advantages of this adhesive include its ability to bond <b>adherends</b> and polyolefins and its good resistance to water, humidity, and chemicals; moreover, it does not require pretreatment of the <b>adherends</b> and is a solvent-free adhesive system.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effect of stitching on the static and fatigue response and related failure modes of co-cured single-lap joints between composite <b>adherends.</b> Two cross-ply layups, [0 2 / 90]s and [90 / 02]s, were selected for the <b>adherends,</b> with the aim of studying the influence of the layer orientation at the joining interface (0 'I- 0 I for joints between [0 2 / 90]s <b>adherends</b> and 90 'I- 90 'I for joints with [90 / 0 2]s <b>adherends).</b> It was found that stitching did not affect the static behaviour of [02 / 90]s joints, but it resulted in a 36 % increase in the static strength of joints between [90 / 0 2]s <b>adherends.</b> However, stitching significantly improved the fatigue life of both [02 / 90]s and [90 / 0 2]s joints by extending the durations of both the crack nucleation and propagation stages. Direct observations indicated that the bridging action of stitches (which remained intact throughout the entire fatigue life of the joints) on delaminated <b>adherends</b> is the physical mechanism responsible for the extension of the crack propagation phase...|$|R
50|$|Adhesive {{fracture}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as interfacial fracture) is when debonding occurs between the adhesive and the <b>adherend.</b> In most cases, the occurrence of adhesive fracture for a given adhesive goes along with smaller fracture toughness.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure-sensitive {{adhesive}} (PSA, self-adhesive, self-stick adhesive) is adhesive {{which forms}} a bond when pressure {{is applied to}} marry the adhesive with the <b>adherend.</b> No solvent, water, or heat is needed to activate the adhesive.It is used in pressure-sensitive tapes, labels, glue dots, note pads, automobile trim, and {{a wide variety of}} other products.|$|E
50|$|Removable {{adhesives}} {{are designed}} to form a temporary bond, and ideally can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the <b>adherend.</b> Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, masking tapes, bookmark and note papers, price marking labels, promotional graphics materials, and for skin contact (wound care dressings, EKG electrodes, athletic tape, analgesic and transdermal drug patches, etc.). Some removable adhesives {{are designed to}} repeatedly stick and unstick. They have low adhesion and generally cannot support much weight.|$|E

30|$|A few {{detailed}} {{reports have}} been made about the fracture behavior of <b>adherends</b> bonded with acrylic-based adhesive under Mode I loading [16 – 18]. These describe the effects of surface treatments on Mode I fracture energy using FRP and aluminum alloy <b>adherends</b> bonded with a toughened acrylic adhesive. The results show that fracture toughness is enhanced by applying surface treatments such as grit blast and γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (γ-MPS). <b>Adherends</b> {{also need to be}} considered not only to determine the designs of structures but also to deal with various materials such as metal/metal, thermoset, and thermoplastic matrices.|$|R
40|$|The {{plane strain}} of adhesively bonded {{structures}} which consist {{of two different}} orthotropic adherents is considered. Assuming that the thicknesses of the <b>adherends</b> are constant and are small {{in relation to the}} lateral dimensions of the bonded region, the <b>adherends</b> are treated as plates. The transverse shear effects in the <b>adherends</b> and the in-plane normal strain in the adhesive are taken into account. The problem is reduced to a system of differential equations for the adhesive stresses which is solved in closed form. A single lap joint and a stiffened plate under various loading conditions are considered as examples. To verify the basic trend of the solutions obtained from the plate theory a sample problem is solved by using the finite element method and by treating the <b>adherends</b> and the adhesive as elastic continua. The plate theory not only predicts the correct trend for the adhesive stresses but also gives rather surprisingly accurate results...|$|R

5000|$|His {{work began}} with his 1944 {{observation}} that [...] "although very little force {{is required to}} detach Scotch tape from an <b>adherend,</b> the work expended in doing so is very large". [...] This is from the elastic effects of the adhesive, on which he commented even if [...] "one idealized the adhesive as a perfectly elastic material {{there appeared to be}} no body of mathematical theory which would provide a basis for calculations". [...] Existing theories were only on very small deformations, so from 1945 to 1951, Rivlin was one of creators of the modern theory of large elastic deformations, including theory of Neo-Hookean solids and Mooney-Rivlin solids. [...] He also made major contributions to the theory of non-Newtonian fluid flow, including in the Rivlin-Ericksen expansion.|$|E
30|$|Another {{modification}} to {{the floating}} roller peel tests {{is suggested by}} Holtmannspotter [10], in which the aluminium rigid <b>adherend</b> {{is replaced by a}} composite rigid <b>adherend.</b> The thin <b>adherend</b> remains of Aluminium as in the standard test. However, due to the asymmetry of the floating roller peel test, the interface being tested is the one on the thin <b>adherend.</b> Therefore, if using Aluminium for the thin <b>adherend,</b> the tested interface is the Aluminium/adhesive and not the one of interest, composite/adhesive.|$|E
40|$|Bonding a fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composite or metallic {{plate to}} the soffit of a reinforced concrete (RC), timber or metallic beam can significantly increase its strength {{and other aspects}} of structural performance. These hybrid beams are often found to fail due to premature debonding of the plate from the original beam in a brittle manner. This has {{led to the development of}} many analytical solutions over the last two decades to quantify the interfacial shear and normal stresses between the <b>adherends.</b> The <b>adherends</b> are subjected to axial, bending and shear deformations. However, most analytical solutions have neglected the influence of shear deformation of the <b>adherends.</b> For the few solutions which consider this effect in an approximate manner, their applicability is limited to one or two specific load cases. This paper presents a general analytical solution for the interfacial stresses in plated beams under an arbitrary loading with the shear deformation of the <b>adherends</b> duly considered. The shear stress distribution is assumed to be parabolic through the depth of the <b>adherends</b> in predicting the interfacial shear stress and Timoshenko's beam theory is adopted in predicting interfacial normal stress to account for the shear deformation. The solution is applicable to a beam of arbitrary prismatic cross-section bonded symmetrically or asymmetrically with a thin or thick plate, both having linear elastic material properties. The effect of shear deformation is illustrated through an example beam. The influence of material and geometric parameters of the <b>adherends</b> and adhesive on the interfacial stress concentrations at the plate end is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of a simple composite to composite bonded joint was analyzed. The cracked lap shear specimen subjected to constant amplitude cyclic loading was studied. Two specimen geometries were tested for each bonded system: (1) a strap <b>adherend</b> of 16 plies bonded to a lap <b>adherend</b> of 8 plies; and (2) a strap <b>adherend</b> of 8 plies bonded to a lap <b>adherend</b> of 16 plies.

40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental investigation {{was conducted on}} bonded composite single-lap joints with the <b>adherends</b> performed to reduce the angle between the line of action of the applied in-plane force and the bondline. A classical closed-form solution was {{used to analyze the}} composite joints with various preform angles and overlap lengths. The <b>adherends</b> of the test specimens were preformed before bonding, during the layup and curing process. Static tests were conducted for preform angles of 0, 5, 10, and 15 deg and overlap lengths of 0. 75, 1. 75, 2. 75, and 3. 75 in. A limited fatigue study was conducted for specimens with a 2. 75 -in. overlap and a preform angle of 5 deg. Results of the analysis showed that preforming the <b>adherends</b> of bonded composite single-lap joints significantly reduced the shear and peel stress concentrations in the adhesive. Experimental results showed that preforming the <b>adherends</b> significantly increased their static and fatigue strength and thus increased the load level for which bonded composite single-lap joints can be designed...|$|R
40|$|A displacement-based multi-layered zig-zag plate {{model with}} {{variable}} in-plane and through-the-thickness representation and fixed {{degrees of freedom}} is developed for analysis of bonded joints with laminated <b>adherends.</b> Characteristic feature, the in-plane representation can be varied across the <b>adherends</b> and the overlap to better simulate the variation of solutions and to satisfy the stress boundary conditions {{at the ends of}} the overlap. To this purpose, continuity functions are incorporated enabling the continuity of displacements and stresses where the representation is changed. Other continuity functions are included to allow an a priori fulfilment of the out-of-plane stress contact conditions at the interfaces of adjacent layers. High-order, through-the-thickness contributions are incorporated allowing the representation to be refined where step gradients rise. As the representation can vary from point to point, the present model permits an accurate analysis of laminates with general boundary conditions and of bonded joints under a unified approach. Applications are presented to sample cases of single- and double-lap joints taken from the literature. Specifically, three single-lap joints are considered, two of which with aluminium <b>adherends</b> and one with laminated composite <b>adherends.</b> Also a double-lap joint with aluminium <b>adherends</b> is analysed.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for the fracture of an adhesively bonded double-cantilever beam that fails with extensive plastic deformation of the <b>adherends.</b> The analysis permits a {{value for the}} toughness of the joint to be distinguished from the energy absorbed by the plastic deformation. Specifically, this value for toughness can be determined from post-fracture observations of the deformation and from {{a knowledge of the}} constitutive properties of the <b>adherends.</b> The analysis has been used to determine experimentally the toughness of plastically deforming joints formed using three different adhesives to bond a series of different thicknesses of aluminium and steel. In each case, it was found that, despite large differences in the extent of deformation, the value for toughness was dependent only on the materials used to form the joint. The toughness was independent of the thickness of the <b>adherends...</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{previously}} described in Section 2, {{one end of}} the lower <b>adherend</b> was kept fixed to the apparatus while the other end was bonded to the upper <b>adherend,</b> in which the load was applied. It is important to remark that no type of failures was observed, considering the applied loads. As can be seen in Figure  4, there is no horizontal displacement of the lower <b>adherend,</b> while the upper <b>adherend</b> presents an uniform displacement on the order of 0.07  mm and no significant deformation of the <b>adherend</b> is observed. Accordingly, the adhesive deforms in shear. Moreover, {{it should be noted that}} both lower and upper adherends present a rotation in the x-y plane, as shown in Figure  5. Neglecting rotations and considering only the initial thickness of the adhesive layer (0.15  mm), an angular distortion equal to 0.47 is achieved.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effect of surface roughness of different <b>adherend</b> material on adhesive bond strength was carried out. The <b>adherend</b> material used was aluminium AA 6061 and wood in the form of sheet, and the adhesive was an epoxy resin. Different surface roughness obtained by mechanical abrasion using an emery paper and sand paper for aluminium and wood <b>adherend</b> samples respectively. Single strap joints were tested at room temperature. Results showed that there is clear dependency observed in between the adhesive bond strength and surface roughness of both wood and aluminium <b>adherend</b> joints. Optimum surface roughness values were obtained in the range of Ra =  1.68  ±  0.14  µm and Ra =  1.64  ±  0.2  µm for the aluminium and wood <b>adherend</b> joints respectively.

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{finite element}} approach based on reduced models with minimum {{degrees of freedom}} {{was applied to the}} post-elastic analysis of bonded joints. The reduced model describes the <b>adherends</b> by means of structural elements (beams or shells) and the adhesive by a single strip of solid elements (plane-stress or brick). Internal kinematic constraints were applied to link the <b>adherends</b> and adhesive meshes. The accuracy and the efficiency of the reduced models in providing the force–displacement curve of T-peel joints were evaluated through a numerical test campaign by comparison with full finite element analyses. The test campaign was designed as a 2 -level factorial experiment involving four variables: the skew angle of the T-peel (45 and 90 ◦), the thickness of the <b>adherends</b> (2 and 3 mm), the material of the <b>adherends</b> (aluminium and steel) and the stress–strain behaviour of the adhesive (brittle and perfectly plastic). The results show that the reduced model reproduces with fair accuracy the load–displacement curves of the joints {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost of the full model.

40|$|The {{well known}} {{features}} of crack face interpenetration/contact {{at the tip}} of an interface crack is re-examined using finite element analysis and assuming material nonlinear properties for the <b>adherends.</b> It was assumed in literature that the crack tips are fully open at all load levels in the presence of material nonlinearity of the <b>adherends.</b> Analysis for the case of remote tension shows that even in the presence of material nonlinearity, crack tip closes at small load levels and opens above a certain load level. Mixed-mode fracture parameters are evaluated for the situation when the crack tips are fully open. Due to the presence of nonlinearity, the mixed-mode fracture parameters are measured with the symmetric and anti-symmetric components of J-integral. The present analysis explains the sequence of events at the interface crack tip with progressively increasing remote tension load for the case of <b>adherends</b> with material nonlinear behaviour...|$|R
