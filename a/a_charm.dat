5|$|The puffball {{was used}} by the Chippewa people of North America as <b>a</b> <b>charm,</b> and medicinally as a hemostat. In British Columbia, Canada, it is used by {{livestock}} farmers who are not allowed to use conventional drugs under certified organic programs. The spore mass of the puffball is applied to bleeding hoof trimming 'nicks', and then wrapped with breathable first-aid tape. It is also similarly used on bleeding areas resulting from disbudding, and wounds resulting from sternal abscesses.|$|E
5|$|Murrell used witch bottles {{as part of}} his magical practices, and, {{during the}} 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple {{encountered}} claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals who had gone overseas. Murrell experimented {{with the use of a}} witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment spell. The idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited <b>a</b> <b>charm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the {{vigilant}} protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells {{of a man who}} wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him {{that he was in the}} valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
5|$|Whistler was {{not entirely}} content with the realism the {{painting}} displayed in its original form, a trait he blamed on the influence Courbet had on him at the time. Later, between 1867 and 1872, he reworked it {{to give it a}} more spiritual expression. Even though Symphony was begun before Whistler first met Rossetti, the Pre-Raphaelite influence is still clear. The painting was an early experiment in white on white, with a woman standing in a white dress in front of a white background. This colour scheme was a subject he would return to later, in two paintings that would be given the titles of Symphony in White, No. 2 (1864) and Symphony in White, No. 3 (1865–67). The panel is long and slender, and the model's pose and the shape of her clothes further emphasise the vertical nature of the painting. The woman is bold, almost confrontational, in her direct gaze at the viewer, and her features are highly individualised. Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E

25|$|D mesons are {{the lightest}} {{particle}} containing charm quarks. They are often studied to gain knowledge on the weak interaction.

25|$|The Standard Model {{also allows}} more exotic decays, {{but only at}} one loop level, meaning that they are {{extremely}} suppressed. In particular, {{it is possible for}} a top quark to decay into another up-type quark (an up or <b>a</b> <b>charm)</b> by emitting a photon or a Z-boson. Searches for these exotic decay modes have provided no evidence for their existence in accordance with expectations from the Standard Model. The branching ratios for these decays have been determined to be less than 5.9 in 1,000 for photonic decay and less than 2.1 in 1,000 for Z-boson decay at 95% confidence.|$|E
25|$|In poetry {{there were}} two main trends, one {{represented}} by Venmani Nampoodiris(venmani Poets) and the other by Kerala Varma. The latter's poetry was modeled on the old Manipravalam style abounding in Sanskrit words and terms, but it had <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> of its own when adapted to express new ideas in that masterly way characteristic of himself. His translation of Kalidasa's Abhijnanasakuntalam in 1882 marks an important event {{in the history of}} Malayalam drama and poetry. Also Kerala Varma's Mayura-sandesam is a Sandesakavya (messenger poem) written after the manner of Kalidasa's Meghadutam. Though it cannot be compared with the original, it was {{still one of the most}} popularly acclaimed poems in Malayalam.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} it was a common belief that fairy {{folklore}} evolved from folk memories of a prehistoric race. It was suggested that newcomers drove out the original inhabitants, and the memories of this defeated, hidden people developed into the fairy beliefs we have today. Proponents of this theory claimed to find support in the tradition of cold iron as <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> against the fairies, which was viewed as a cultural memory of invaders with iron weapons displacing inhabitants who had only flint and were therefore easily defeated. Some 19th-century archaeologists thought they had found underground rooms in the Orkney islands resembling the Elfland in Childe Rowland. However the idea of a fallen vanquished race in hiding has fallen out of favour with scholars.|$|E

The Findings Trail was {{designed}} by Laura Potter, a practising maker and graduate from the School of Jewellery.

There is also a glass cat's eye set into each information plaque which reflects light at night and day on the principle of a gemstone set in jewellery. Slabs contain various elements of either stainless steel or cast bronze. The Charm Bracelet Trail was designed by the Birmingham-based artist partnership Renn and Thacker. The trail is shaped like a giant bronze charm bracelet. At the bottom of Newhall Hill is <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> bracelet padlock that illuminates at night, marking the start of the trail.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1948, Welles {{convinced}} Republic Pictures {{to let him}} {{direct a}} low-budget version of Macbeth, which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed {{in an attempt to}} make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting Macbeth as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-Kane Hollywood productions, Macbeth is stylistically closest to Citizen Kane in its long takes and deep focus photography.|$|E
25|$|Although {{considered}} haram in Islamic dietary laws, {{the wolf}} {{is important in}} Moroccan folk medicine. Edvard Westermarck wrote of several remedies derived from the wolf in Morocco, {{including the use of}} its fat as a lotion, the consumption of its meat to treat respiratory ailments, and the burning of its intestines in fumigation rituals meant to increase the fertility of married couples. The wolf's gall bladder was said to have various uses, including curing sexual impotence and serving as <b>a</b> <b>charm</b> for women wishing to divorce their husbands. Westermarck noted, however, that the wolf was also associated with more nefarious qualities: it was said that a child who eats wolf flesh before reaching puberty will be forever cursed with misfortune and that scribes and saintly persons refrain from consuming it even in areas where it is socially acceptable, as doing so would render their charms useless.|$|E
