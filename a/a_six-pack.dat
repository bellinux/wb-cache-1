5|$|Following {{her first}} face turn, Stratus began wrestling part-time. She {{teamed up with}} Lita against then-heels, Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson at InVasion. After {{suffering}} an ankle injury in the summer, however, she was sidelined for the following three months. This interrupted not only her recent venture into wrestling, but also an on-screen romance with Jeff Hardy and budding storyline with Team Xtreme. As she rehabilitated, she kept herself visible by co-hosting Excess on TNN. After returning in autumn, Stratus appeared at Survivor Series where she won the WWF Women's Championship {{for the first time}} in <b>a</b> <b>six-pack</b> challenge. Stratus was next involved in a feud with Jazz over the Women's Championship, where she retained the championship at the Royal Rumble, but dropped the championship to Jazz two weeks later on the February 4, 2002 episode of Raw. Stratus then attempted to regain the title for several months, including competing in a triple threat match at WrestleMania X8 against Lita and Jazz in her hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but failed to win the match. While chasing after the Women's Championship, Stratus won the WWE Hardcore Championship on May 6, pinning Crash Holly after Bubba Ray Dudley hit him over the head with a trash can. She lost the title to Steven Richards soon afterward however, due to the stipulation that the belt was to be defended 24/7 as long as there was a referee present. One week later, she regained the Women's Championship in a tag team match with Bubba Ray Dudley. During this time, Stratus began wrestling solely on the Raw brand after being drafted in the WWF Brand Extension.|$|E

25|$|Every player's {{character}} is assigned six clones, known as <b>a</b> <b>six-pack,</b> {{which are used}} to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death. The game lacks a conventional health system; most wounds the player characters can suffer {{are assumed to be}} fatal. As a result, Paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed, yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game. This easy spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights, gruesome slapstick, and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character's clone family. Additional clones can be purchased if one gains sufficient favour with the Computer.|$|E
25|$|The Miz and Maryse {{continued}} their impersonation of John Cena and Nikki Bella.

On the September 27 episode of Raw, Jericho faced Randy Orton who punted him in the head. This was used to explain Jericho's departure from the company. The match ended in a draw due to the no contest nature of the finish. Jericho later told WWE.com that he wouldn't be a full-time superstar again during his career due to his music commitments with band Fozzy.|$|E

ESPN {{reported}} that: [...] "questions about his defense and power with wood kept him out of the top part of the draft." [...] He signed for a mere $12,000 signing bonus. [...] "Kevin would have played for <b>a</b> <b>six-pack</b> of beer", his father said.|$|E

5000|$|Dixon keeps George {{company as}} the latter goes through the trials of {{applying}} for public benefits. His eventual meeting with the advocate Laura (Datz) leads to more self-realizations about the help he needs. Seeking reconciliation with his estranged daughter Maggie (Malone), his vulnerability is palpable. He appears [...] "guiltily obsessed with somehow reconnecting with her." [...] Throughout the story, as George's character and background become more evident, he also becomes increasingly anhedonic; the only moments of joy seem to be when he enjoys <b>an</b> occasional <b>six-pack.</b> The story ends with George reaching out to Maggie in hopes for forgiveness and support.|$|R
5000|$|Zombie Lane {{was praised}} by reviewers {{in terms of}} its {{graphics}} and gameplay. Gamezebo's Andrew Webster stated [...] "Zombie Lane sports smooth and charming 3D visuals, with distinct characters and solid animation. The soundtrack, too, has a very fitting horror crossed with comedy vibe." [...] He compared the game to FrontierVille, stating [...] "The core game may not be all that original, but Zombie Lane still feels like a fresh experience." [...] Seattle Post-Intelligencer writer Josh Sprague Stated [...] "..it‚Äôs actually {{a lot of fun to}} pump lead into some zombies while you‚Äôre waiting for your strawberries to ripen.

Ivory formed {{an alliance with}} former WCW wrestlers Torrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler after helping them defeat Jacqueline in a handicap match, but later turned on Wilson due to her budding romance with Tajiri. Ivory eventually became the valet for Lance Storm.

500|$|The Avalanches have {{described}} the album as a [...] "road trip" [...] in a [...] "big, wide, expansive country like Australia." [...] For inspiration, the group looked back on their teenage years of driving {{around the country and}} suburbia listening to music. The record is supposed to [...] "capture that feeling of growing up...jumping in the car and hitting the road with <b>a</b> <b>six-pack</b> and heading out to the bush." [...] The album attempts to capture the [...] "halfway between happy and sad" [...] feeling similar to old Beach Boys records which are a constant inspiration for the group. Chater felt that this feeling is what made Since I Left You a success, and they have continuously strived to create that feeling. Di Blasi thinks of Wildflower as a free-spirited person who does what they wish regardless of conventionality. The album features many samples from 1960s psychedelic music and relates to the era through counterculture and anti-establishment themes.|$|E
50|$|The cover art {{also contributed}} to the album's legend. Initially self-released only in a limited vinyl run of 500, each copy of the album {{received}} a unique, handmade cover. Decorated by band members, friends and family with myriad methods such as screen-printing, hand-painting, and affixing various found objects (including <b>an</b> empty <b>six-pack</b> carton of Natural Light) to plain white sleeves, these albums grew in value over the years and as of 2005, were known to have sold for prices in the thousands of dollars.
