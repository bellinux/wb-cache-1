40|$|SUMMARY A recent {{epidemic}} of acute conjunctivitis in Singapore showed again {{the importance of}} Coxsackie virus type A 24 variant as a causative agent of <b>acute</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (AHC). Although the ocular manifestations appeared similar to those described for the 1970 and 1975 outbreaks, a markedly higher rate of respiratory involvements was noted. Not observed in previous epidemics were herpes-like vesicles in the conjunctiva and eyelids of one patient and vesicles in the buccal mucosa and lips of another from whom Coxsackie virus A 24 was isolated. The most interesting finding {{in this study was}} the isolation of five wild (non-Sabin) poliovirus type 1 strains. Three strains were obtained from conjunctival and two from throat swabs of patients with mild to severe conjunctivitis. It is conceivable that the rare reports of polio-like paralysis or radiculomyelitis accompanying or following AHC in a few Asian countries could be attributed to concurrent infections with a poliovirus and either enterovirus type 70 or Coxsackie virus type A 24. <b>Acute</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (AHC), known also as Apollo II disease, Singapore epidemic con-junctivitis, picornavirus epidemic conjunctivitis, and Bangla Joy conjunctivitis has affected hundreds o...|$|E

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of <b>acute</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (AHC) occurred {{in and around}} Chandigarh, north India, during June, July and August 1981.

During follow-up, it was observed that some of the AHC cases were shedding virus-infected conjunctival cells for a prolonged period, even after clinical recovery and during convalescence, before they became free from virus.

40|$|Ninety {{cases of}} the {{neurological}} manifestations associated with <b>acute</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> caused by Enterovirus 70 (EV 70) are reported. The patients were seen during the widespread epidemics in 1971 and 1981. Male adults were predominantly affected by a "polio-like" paralysis of the limbs and/or cranial nerves. Root pains were often complained of early in the disease. In {{the absence of a}} necropsy, clinical and neurophysiological examinations helped to localise the lesions. Significant antibody titres against EV 70 were demonstrated in the serum and more relevantly in the CSF. Though other viruses can cause sporadic and epidemic conjunctivitis and similar paralysis independently, the combination of a haemorrhagic conjunctivitis and a neurological disease mostly simulating poliomyelitis is caused by EV 70 alone. It is therefore suggested that this combination be called "Enterovirus 70 disease". Because of its neurovirulence, it is important to identify this virus {{at the very beginning of}} an epidemic of conjunctivitis, so as to limit its spread by strict public health measures...|$|E

Are emerging infections a new phenomenon related to modern life, or do more basic determinants, transcending time, place, and human progress, govern disease generation?
