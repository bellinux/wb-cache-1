5|$|The {{road through}} Gateshead Fell was turnpiked by the Durham to Tyne Bridge Road Act in 1747. Although it had brought some early {{settlers}} to the area, {{the development of}} industry allowed the formative settlement to grow. In 1740, John Warburton opened a pottery at Carr Hill which is credited with introducing white earthenware to Tyneside. Encouraged by Warburton's success, Paul Jackson established the Sheriff Hill Pottery in 1771 at {{the northern end of}} the turnpike road and by 1775 was advertising his earthenware in the Newcastle Journal. Jackson's pottery, which became a local centre of pottery production, attracted settlers to the area and became <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> to local residents.|$|E
5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b>|$|E

25|$|Commenting on {{the issue}} on Guy A.

The liberal government has repeatedly stated that Hydro-Québec is not for sale.|$|E

25|$|The 1896 {{lighthouse}} {{also has}} strong social significance for Sunshine Coast residents. As the only {{town on the}} Sunshine Coast to possess a lighthouse, it was <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> for the community and helped to distinguish Caloundra from other coastal settlements. Both the symbolic and functional nature of the 1896 lighthouse contributed to Caloundra's sense of identity as a popular seaside resort with a role in navigating the North West Channel into Brisbane. The symbolic nature of the lighthouse is evidenced by its depiction on tourist brochures, logos and crests throughout the twentieth century.|$|E

Minato-za had competition from Satō's estranged son Kyūichi, who at some point opened Green House, a cinema specializing in Western films.|$|E

25|$|The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory {{was first}} {{developed}} in 1990 by Scott J. Dickman. This scale {{is based on}} Dickman's proposal {{that there are two}} types of impulsivity that are significantly different from one another. This includes functional impulsivity which is characterized by quick decision making when it is optimal, a trait that is often considered to be <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b> The scale also includes dysfunctional impulsivity which is characterized by making quick decisions when it is not optimal. This type of impulsivity is most often associated with life difficulties including substance abuse problems and other negative outcomes.|$|E
25|$|In Dragonlance Adventures, the kender are {{depicted}} with several qualities {{that make them}} stand out. They obtain a wizened appearance as they grow older, due to a fine network of lines that appears on their faces around age forty, and have pointed ears which gives them somewhat of a resemblance to elves. Kender {{tend to have a}} wide vocal range, enabling older individuals to perform impressive sound imitations. In addition, they are often depicted as rambling and speaking very quickly when excited, which can make them difficult to understand. Finally, they are described as having a distinctive topknot incorporated into their hairstyles, which is <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Australian Grand Prix for World Championship Formula One racing was {{hosted by}} Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the Adelaide Street Circuit which {{was laid out}} in the city's East End as well as the eastern parklands {{including}} the Victoria Park Racecourse. The Grand Prix became <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful Clipsal 500 for V8 Supercar racing, held on {{a modified version of the}} same street circuit.

25|$|Ghiberti won the competition. His {{first set}} of Baptistry doors took 27 years to complete, after which he was {{commissioned}} to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground {{for many of the}} artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of linear perspective, the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art. They were a unifying factor, <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> and camaraderie for both the city and its artists. Michelangelo was to call them the Gates of Paradise.|$|E
25|$|It {{would appear}} that Gregory Cromwell, and John More, the son of Thomas More, have been wrongly assumed to have been unintelligent, simply because they {{happened}} to be overshadowed by their extraordinary fathers. It is evident that Cromwell's son was a capable scholar, who besides mastering Latin, French and accounting, had learned to play the lute and virginals and excelled in the outdoor pursuits of riding, hunting with the longbow and hawking. He was athletic and therefore had {{much in common with}} his older cousin, the courtier Richard Cromwell. It is apparent that Gregory Cromwell was an intelligent, well-educated and accomplished young man who must have been <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> to his father.|$|E
25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of a student is seen as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid academic failure which brings shame to the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of}} a defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the shame of defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E
