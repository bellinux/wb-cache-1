This is why most third world democracies are not successful in terms of political stability and sustainable development. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pan,</b> the second pattern, nondemocratic government with the rule of law, has been proven to be a viable political option, especially for countries without democratic traditions. Hong Kong and Singapore are well-governed societies with efficient and clean government. Therefore Pan concludes that at least in the mid-term future, China should focus its political reform on building up the rule of law, since that can best ensure the emergence of successful democracies as in the West. Moreover, Pan even suggests that due to its history and culture, the Singapore option of rule of law without democracy may also suit China in the long run. As a result.

Two linguistically and culturally distinguished streams emerged in Hong Kong’s educational system in the first 100  years under the British rule (1842 – 1941): an Anglo-Chinese stream which offered Western-style primary and secondary education through the medium of English, and a Chinese-medium stream which offered primary/elementary education which, in terms of content and method, was similar to that in Mainland China (So 1992). Before the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937 – 1945), Chinese language (i.e. oral Cantonese and written MSC) received much more attention in the privately-run Chinese schools and missionary schools that catered for the majority of the population than in the government-run elite schools ((Adamson and Lai 1997), 89).

Agricultural Research Service {{scientist}} Zhongli Pan and colleagues have tackled the challenge of lowering some of the fat from this favorite side order without skimping on the fries’ delicious taste and texture or their pleasing appearance and aroma. Their idea? After potatoes are peeled and sliced into strips, and just before the raw strips are dunked in the fryer, prep them with 3 minutes of infrared (IR) heat—just like that created in home or commercial IR ovens or grills. The IR prep “forms a nice, microscopic crust on the fries, which helps reduce oil uptake,” says Pan, an agricultural engineer at the ARS Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California. His team has made hundreds of fries— about 20 pounds in all—to determine the best combination of IR heating times and intensities, and deep-frying times and temps, to produce appetizing fries with less oil. In these experiments, Pan’s group used an IR unit with emitters that heated the top and underside of the fries, each a square-cut strip about 3 / 8 -inch by 4 inches. Fries that were prepped with 3 minutes of infrared at 120 kilowatts per square foot, then deep-fried at about 295 ˚F for 7 minutes, had about one-third (37. 1 percent) less oil than fresh-cut fries that were not prepped with IR heat.

The pipes of subsurface irrigation system were installed at 90 cm distance from trees trunk at each side of trees, and 50 cm from soil surface. Mean of pressure and discharge in the pipes was 0. 8 to 1 atmosphere and 5. 4 Lh- 1 m- 1, respectively. Different factors of quantity and quality pistachio yield, current vegetative growth, water use efficiency and soil electrical conductivity were measured. The results showed that change of conventional (flooding) to subsurface irrigation system is possible and the best treatment can have water rate of 7174 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 with 14 days irrigation interval. In comparison with other treatments, this treatment has better quantity and quality pistachio yield. Water use efficiency (WUE) of this treatment was 164 g dry yield per cubic meter. Nevertheless, application of water rate of 4783 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 can result in the deficiency of irrigation water. At this water rate, WUE was 177 g dry yield per cubic meter.
