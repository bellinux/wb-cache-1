It is unable to apply the calculating methods of design and gear cutting {{to be used in}} the hypoid gears with a 90 -degree shaft angle to the <b>angular</b> hypoid <b>gears</b> as they are. Then the present report describes on several conditions required to expand the design method of hypoid gears heretofore into the <b>angular</b> hypoid <b>gears.</b> Consequently the design elements of the offset, the spiral angle, the cutter radius, the curvature of the tooth trace, and so on have been treated as a positive value usually, but it becomes clear that they have to mark the plus or minus sign for the method of common design...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{the shaft}} angle of {{automotive}} hypoid gears is 90 degrees. Therefore, the design method of an <b>angular</b> hypoid <b>gear</b> {{had not been}} investigated sufficiently up to now. Moreover, the tooth spiral of the hypoid gear is generally on the right hand and the pinion axis is offset below the gear axis. Therefore, when the pinion axis is offset conversely, the design method has not been investigated in detail. In the present report, by using basic equations on the <b>angular</b> hypoid <b>gear</b> with an opposite offset obtained in the previous paper, the design dimensions of the <b>angular</b> hypoid <b>gear</b> whose shaft angle is {{in the region of}} 70 ～ 100 -degrees are shown. As a result, it was found that as the shaft angle increases the pitch angle of the gear increases, but that of the pinion does not so much change and the bias angle which shows the inclination of the tooth bearing changes negatively or positively the sign near the 90 -degree shaft angle on the drive-side tooth surface...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified computer mouse, the Orienting Mouse, which delivers orientation {{as an additional}} dimension of input; when the mouse is moved {{on a flat surface}} it reports, in addition to the conventional x, y translation, angular rotation of the device in the x, y plane. The orienting mouse preserves important properties of the standard mouse; all measurements are relative and movement is tracked only while the mouse is on its flat surface. If the user lets go of the mouse, leaving it on the surface, its position and orientation do not change until it is touched again. Picking the mouse up and putting it down in a different orientation leaves the angle and position unchanged. While the concept of sensing mouse rotation is not new, our work focuses on movement and navigation in 3 D, rather than on precision positioning tasks. We describe a number of sample applications developed to test its effectiveness in this context. Specific features exploited and described include (i) an algorithm for calculating the mouse angle which cancels drift between the two sensors, and (ii) the use of <b>angular</b> <b>gearing</b> which avoids unnatural and uncomfortable hand positions when moving through large angles; informal user testing validates this idea...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the problem of angular {{vibration}} measurements in time history of rotation angle, angular velocity or angular acceleration. The source of information about angular vibrations is an encoder producing an impulse signal. It is supposed that the impulse frequency is changed proportionally to the rotational frequency. A time record of an impulse signal is transformed to an analytical signal using Hilbert transformation. The unwrapped phase of the analytical signal gives the rotation angle, which is employed to evaluation of angular velocity and angular acceleration. Key words: angular vibration, <b>angular</b> acceleration, <b>gears,</b> transmission error, car engines. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} an {{investigation}} about {{the feasibility of}} a wavelet analysis for gear rattle metric in transmission gears, due to tooth impacts under unloaded conditions, is conducted. The technique adopts the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), following the Multi-resolution analysis, to decompose an experimental signal of the relative <b>angular</b> motion of <b>gears</b> into an approximation and in some detail vectors. The described procedure, previously developed by the authors, permits the qualitative evaluation of the impacts occurring between the teeth by examining in particular the detail vectors coming out from the wavelet decomposition. The technique enables discriminating between the impacts occurring on the two different sides of tooth. This situation {{is typical of the}} double-sided gear rattle produced in the automotive gear boxes. This paper considers the influence of oil lubricant, inserted between the teeth, in reducing the impacts. Analysis is performed by comparing three different lubrication conditions, and some of the classical wavelet functions adopted in literature are tested as "mother" wavelet. Moreover, comparisons with a metric based on the harmonic analysis by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), often adopted in this field, are conducted to put in evidence the advantages of the Wavelet technique with reference to the influence of some fundamental operative parameters. The experimental signals of the relative <b>angular</b> rotation of <b>gear</b> are acquired by two high resolution incremental encoders on a specific test rig for lightly loaded gears. The results of the proposed method appear optimistic also in the detection of defects that could produce little variations in the dynamic behavior of unloaded gears...|$|R

30|$|To tackle this issue, {{the most}} common methods are {{combining}} the computed order analysis (COA) and the gear noise elimination-based algorithms. Borghesani et al. [9] proposed an algorithm which includes eliminating influences of speed fluctuation with the <b>angular</b> resampling, removing <b>gear</b> interferences by the denoising method, applying the reverse order tracking and the angular resampling to the denoised signal, and detecting fault by the envelope analysis. This method is complicated and critically depends on the tachometer which is not always available. Focused on the above defects, Wang et al. [10] proposed an adaptive noise cancellation-based method. In this method, the IDMM trend is extracted from the TFR of the raw signal as a reference to remove the gear noise, then {{with the help of}} instantaneous fault characteristic frequency extracted from the envelope TFR of the denoised signal, the COA is applied to diagnose fault bearing. In addition, a bearing fault diagnosis method based on the empirical mode decomposition and the COA is proposed in Ref. [11]. Compared with the method proposed by Borghesani et al., the latter two methods can effectively remove the limitation of the tachometer. However, all the above methods rely on the COA.|$|R
40|$|Scuffing {{failures}} {{may appear}} in an unexpected way, owing to major or minor dynamic overload effects. In this paper some experimental results obtained during a scuffing test campaign on aerospace spur gear are analyzed, {{with the aim}} to correlate these dynamic effects with the sudden development of scuffing. An accurate though simple dynamic model simulating the torsional behaviour the test rig was developed. In particular the meshing stiffness of the test gears was calculated as function of the <b>gear</b> <b>angular</b> position, for different load conditions. The other components of the test rig (slave gears, shafts, etc.) were considered in a lumped parameter model. The dynamic simulation of the reduced system provided the time history of the loads between the test gear teeth. In this way, {{it was possible to}} analyze the correlation between the resonance conditions (and related dynamic overloads) and both the vibratory behaviour of the rig, as measured through several accelerometers, and the observed scuffing phenomena. Moreover, it was possible to determine the effect of this dynamic behaviour on some indicators and to verify whether the prediction of scuffing predictions could be improved when the actual loads are used...|$|R
40|$|Lapping appears like {{a miraculous}} process, {{because it can}} produce {{surfaces}} that are perfectly flat, perfectly round, perfectly smooth, perfectly sharp, or perfectly accurate. Under the correct circumstances, it can impart or improve precise geometry (flatness, roundness, etc.), improve surface finish, improve surface quality, achieve high dimensional accuracy (length, diameter, etc.), improve <b>angular</b> accuracy (worm <b>gears,</b> couplings, etc.), improve fit, and above all, sharpen the tools. This paper presents research on calculating the material removal rate for a machining component by the lapping process. The cast iron sample with an outer diameter of 50 mm and an inner diameter of 45 mm was tested on a single plate tabletop lapping machine. Experiments based on design of experiments were conducted by varying lapping load, lapping time, paste concentration, lapping fluid, and by using different types of abrasives.

Optimum machining parameters for material removal rate are estimated and verified with experimental results and are found to be in good agreement. The confirmation test exhibits high material removal rate by using Al 2 O 3 abrasive particles together with oil as a carrier fluid under the impression of high load.
