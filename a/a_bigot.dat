5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither <b>a</b> <b>bigot</b> nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} term of his mayoralty, Johnson was {{perceived}} as having moved leftward on certain issues, for instance by supporting the London Living Wage {{and the idea of}} an amnesty for illegal migrants. He tried placating critics who had deemed him <b>a</b> <b>bigot</b> by appearing at London's gay pride parade and praising ethnic minority newspapers. In 2012, he banned London buses from displaying the adverts of Core Issues Trust, a Christian group, which compared being gay to an illness. In August 2008, Johnson broke from the traditional protocol of those in public office not publicly commenting on other nations' elections by endorsing Barack Obama for the presidency of the United States.|$|E
25|$|According {{to colonial}} era British historians, Tipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus and Christians. According to C. K. Kareem, Tippu Sultan issued an edict for the {{destruction}} of Hindu temples in Kerala. However, he also made regular endowments to Hindus and Hindu institutions in Mysore, including 156 temples. In recent decades, a number of Hindu groups have reviled Tipu Sultan as <b>a</b> <b>bigot</b> who massacred Hindus, arguing that he carry out forced conversions of Hindus and Christians. A number of historians, however, argue that these accounts come from colonial British sources deemed to be unreliable or fabricated as they had a strong vested interest in presenting Tipu as a tyrant from whom the British had liberated Mysore. The portrayal of Tipu Sultan as a religious bigot is disputed, and some sources suggest that he in fact often embraced religious pluralism.|$|E
500|$|Salma Yaqoob, then {{leader of}} the Respect Party, said in 2010 of Choudary: [...] "He is <b>a</b> <b>bigot</b> whose goal {{in life is to}} provoke division. He engages in these provocations because he is deeply hostile to any coming {{together}} of Muslims and non-Muslims. For him, the fact {{that a majority of the}} British people – Muslim and non-Muslim – oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated, but is something to be feared." [...] Rod Liddle, writing in The Spectator, said: [...] "Anjem Choudray...is one of those thick-as-mince gobby little chancers who could only possibly come from Britain." [...] Conservatives in the United States have also been critical of Choudary. Fox News host Sean Hannity called Choudary [...] "one sick, miserable, evil S.O.B." [...] during a segment on his show discussing the 2011 Egyptian protests.|$|E

Both ruled, but Tione being the older and more dominant person wielded the greater influence.|$|R
500|$|Bundy spoke warmly of his {{grandparents}} in some interviews, and told Rule that he [...] "identified with", [...] "respected", and [...] "clung to" [...] his grandfather; {{but he and}} other family members told attorneys in 1987 that Samuel Cowell was a tyrannical bully and <b>a</b> <b>bigot</b> who hated blacks, Italians, Catholics, and Jews, beat his wife and the family dog, and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. He once threw Louise's younger sister Julia {{down a flight of stairs}} for oversleeping. He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences, and at least once he flew into a violent rage when the question of Ted's paternity was raised. Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression and feared leaving their house toward the end of her life. Ted occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior, even at that early age. Julia recalled awakening one day from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the Cowell kitchen; her three-year-old nephew was standing by the bed, smiling.|$|E
2500|$|Livingstone's {{campaign}} portrayed Johnson as both an out-of-touch toff and <b>a</b> <b>bigot,</b> {{as evidenced}} by racist and homophobic language that he had used in his column; Johnson responded that these quotes had {{been taken out of}} context and were meant as satire. Johnson insisted that he was not <b>a</b> <b>bigot,</b> declaring that [...] "I'm absolutely 100% anti-racist; I despise and loath racism". Publicly emphasising his Turkish ancestry, he went contrary to Conservative policy by declaring his support for an earned amnesty for illegal immigrants. However, the allegations were exacerbated when the far-right British National Party (BNP) urged its supporters to give their second preference votes to Johnson; he responded by [...] "utterly and unreservedly" [...] condemning the BNP. Controversy was also generated during the campaign when Johnson admitted that as a student he had used cannabis and cocaine.|$|E

Hadfield became far less popular when in 1860, Hadfield upheld Wiremu Kīngi's claim to the Waitara block. The surveying of this land prior to military occupation precipitated the First Taranaki War, and Hadfield became a leading critic of the Government in these actions.

2500|$|Part of Big Black's local unpopularity {{stemmed from}} Albini and the vitriol he {{regularly}} directed at Chicago's rock scene: by 1985, the Metro Chicago {{was the only}} club {{in the city that}} was booking punk rock shows and was also large enough to accommodate Big Black, but after performing there Albini badmouthed the club in an interview and found himself banned from it permanently. Compounding the problem were the band's aggressive, noise-driven sound and Albini's confrontational lyrics, which tested the tolerance of his white liberal audience by mercilessly satirizing racism, sexism, chauvinism, and stereotypes of homosexuality, sometimes using pejoratives like [...] "darkie" [...] and [...] "fag" [...] to drive home the point; this led some listeners to consider him <b>a</b> <b>bigot.</b>|$|E
