5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information <b>about</b> <b>time,</b> place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1190s, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles, an Argyllman who was {{probably}} a meic Somairle candidate, was deposed and replaced by Michael (died 1203), a Manxman who {{appears to have been}} backed by Rǫgnvaldr. Cristinus' tenure appears to have spanned at least two decades, during a sustained period of meic Somairle power in the Isles. His downfall, however, came about at <b>about</b> <b>time</b> of the Crovan dynasty's resurgence under Rǫgnvaldr. The latter succeeded his father only years before, in 1187, and appears to have capitalised upon the infighting amongst the meic Somairle, and possibly even the downfall of Ragnall himself. Although the first known Bishop of Argyll, Haraldr, is accorded a tenure during {{the first quarter of the}} thirteenth century, it is likely that there were earlier bishops unknown to surviving sources. In fact, the diocese first appears on record in Liber Censuum, a Papal document dating to the last decade of the twelfth century; and it is possible that Cristinus, or an unknown successor, or perhaps even Haraldr himself, was the first dicocesan bishop. Whatever the case, Cristinus' tenure in the Isles may have witnessed an ecclesiastical reorientation, or shift of sorts, towards Argyll.|$|E
