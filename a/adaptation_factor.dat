The thresholds for all spatial frequencies (1 – 12 c/deg), flashed-background intensities (dark to 4 log td) and adapting-background intensities (dark to 4 log td) were adequately described by a simple model consisting of a compressive nonlinearity (a modified Naka-Rushton function), a subtractive <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor,</b> and a multiplicative <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor.</b> For all five subjects the compressive nonlinearity was found to vary systematically with spatial frequency; for all but one subject, the subtractive and multiplicative factors were found to be relatively constant...|$|E

40|$|In {{any given}} analogy, there are {{potentially}} {{a large number}} of possible mapping interpretations. One of the key issues in analogy research is how one of these mappings comes to be selected as optimal and used {{as the basis for the}} analogical comparison. It is well-established that structural factors, notably systematicity, can act as selection constraints on mapping. The present work tests to see if pragmatic and <b>adaptation</b> <b>factors</b> can also act as selection constraints on mapping. The selection of a mapping based on pragmatic factors proposes that people can exploit the higher-order, schematic structure of a domain to select one mapping over another. With respect to <b>adaptation</b> <b>factors,</b> the proposal is that a mapping will be selected if it is evaluated as being easily adapted relative to other competing mappings. Both of these predictions are tested in a novel, problem solving paradigm. The main finding is that <b>adaptation</b> <b>factors</b> do act as a selection constraint but that pragmatic factors do not.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm of speech enhancement using data adaptive softthresolding technique. The noisy speech signal is decomposed into a finite set of band limited signals called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Each IMF {{is divided into}} fixed length subframes. On the basis of noise contamination, the subframes are classified into two groups – noise dominant and speech dominant. Only the noise dominant subframes are thresholded for noise suppression. A data adaptive threshold function is computed for individual IMF {{on the basis of}} its variance. We propose a function for optimum <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> for adaptive thresholding which was previously prepared by the least squares method using the estimated input signal to noise ratio (SNR) and calculated <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> to obtain maximum output SNR. Moreover, good efficiency of the algorithm is achieved by an appropriate subframe processing.

To study these <b>adaptation</b> <b>factors,</b> an antibiotic-resistant derivative of the probiotic model organism Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS 1 was repeatedly exposed to the mouse digestive tract by three consecutive rounds of (re) feeding of the longest persisting colonies. This exposure to the murine intestine allowed the isolation of intestine-adapted derivatives of the original strain that displayed prolonged digestive tract residence time. Re-sequencing of the genomes of these adapted derivatives revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as a single nucleotide insertion in comparison with the genome of the original WCFS 1 strain. Detailed in silico analysis of the identified genomic modifications pinpointed that alterations in the coding regions of genes encoding cell envelope associated functions and energy metabolism appeared to be beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract survival of L. plantarum WCFS 1. This work demonstrates the feasibility of experimental evolution for the enhancement of the gastrointestinal residence time of probiotic strains, while full-genome resequencing of the adapted isolates provided clues towards the bacterial functions involved. Enhanced gastrointestinal residence is industrially relevant because it enhances the efficacy of the delivery of viable probiotics in situ. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a novel power {{adaptive}} network coding (PANC) for a non-orthogonal multiple-access relay channel (MARC), where two sources transmit their in-formation simultaneously to the destination {{with the help of a}} relay. In contrast to the conventional XOR-based network coding (CXNC), the relay in PANC generates network coded symbols by considering the coefficients of the source-to-relay channels, and forwards each symbol with a pre-optimized power level. Specifically, by defining a symbol pair as two symbols from the two sources, we first derive the expression of symbol pair error rate (SPER) for the system. Noting that deriving the exact SPER are complex due to the irregularity of the decision regions caused by random channel coefficients, we propose a coordinate transform (CT) method on the received constellation to simplify the derivations of the SPER. Next, we obtain the optimal power level by decomposing it as a multiplication of a power scaling factor and a power <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor.</b> We prove that with the power scaling factor at the relay, our PANC scheme can achieve a full diversity gain, i. e., an order of two diversity gain, while the CXNC can achieve only an order of one diversity gain. In addition, we optimize the power <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> at the relay to minimize the SPER at the destination by considering of the relationship between SPER and minimum Euclidean distance of the received constellation, resulting in an improved coding gain. Simulation results show that (1) the SPER derived based on our CT method can well approximate the exact SPER with a much lower complexity; (2) the PANC scheme with power adaptation optimizations and power scaling factor design can achieve a full diversity, and obtain a much higher coding gain than other network coding schemes.

40|$|The Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and the Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) are frequency-domain estimators, {{based on}} the multivariate autoregressive {{modelling}} (MVAR) of time series, {{that are able to}} describe interactions between cortical areas in terms of the concept of Granger causality. However, the classical estimation of these methods requires the stationary of the signals. In this way, transient pathways of information transfer remains hidden. The objective {{of this study is to}} test a time-varying multivariate method for the estimation of rapidly changing connectivity relationships between cortical areas of the human brain, based on DTF/PDC and on the use of adaptive MVAR modelling (AMYAR). This approach will allow the observation of transient Influences between the cortical areas during the execution of a task. Time-varying DTF and PDC were obtained by the adaptive recursive fit of an MVAR model with time-dependent parameters, by means of a generalized recursive least-square (RLS) algorithm, taking into consideration a set of EEG epochs. Simulations were performed under different levels of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), number of trials (TRIALS) and frequency bands (BAND), and of different values of the RLS <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> adopted (factor C). The results indicated that time-varying DTF and PDC are able to estimate correctly the imposed connectivity patterns under reasonable operative conditions of SNR ad number of trials. Moreover, the capability of follow the rapid changes In connectivity is highly increased by the number of trials at disposal, and by the right choice of the value adopted for the <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> C.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the problem of}} noise reduction from observed speech by means of improving quality and/or intelligibility of the speech using single-channel speech enhancement method. In this study, we propose two approaches for speech enhancement. One is based on traditional Fourier transform using the strategy of Noise Subtraction (NS) that is equivalent to Spectral Subtraction (SS) {{and the other is}} based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) using the strategy of adaptive thresholding. First of all, the two different methods are implemented individually and observe that, both the methods are noise dependent and capable to enhance speech signal to a certain limit. Moreover, traditional NS generates unwanted residual noise as well. We implement nonlinear weight to eliminate this effect and propose Nonlinear Weighted Noise Subtraction (NWNS) method. In first stage, we estimate the noise and then calculate the Degree Of Noise (DON 1) from the ratio of the estimated noise power to the observed speech power in frame basis for different input Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) of the given speech signal. The noise is not accurately estimated using Minima Value Sequence (MVS). So the noise estimation accuracy is improved by adopting DON 1 into MVS. The first stage performs well for wideband stationary noises and performed well over wide range of SNRs. Most of the real world noise is narrowband non-stationary and EMD is a powerful tool for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary signals like speech. EMD decomposes any signals into a finite number of band limited signals called intrinsic mode function (IMFs). Since the IMFs having different noise and speech energy distribution, hence each IMF has a different noise and speech variance. These variances change for different IMFs. Therefore an adaptive threshold function is used, which is changed with newly computed variances for each IMF. In the adaptive threshold function, <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> is the ratio of the square root of added noise variance to the square root of estimated noise variance. It is experimentally observed that the better speech enhancement performance is achieved for optimum <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor.</b> We tested the speech enhancement performance using only EMD based adaptive thresholding method and obtained the outcome only up to a certain limit. Therefore, further enhancement from the individual one, we propose two-stage processing technique, NWNS+EMD. The first stage is used as a pre-process for noise removal to a certain level resulting first enhanced speech and placed this into second stage for further removal of remaining noise as well as musical noise to obtain final enhancement of the speech. But traditional NS in the first stage produces better output SNR up to 10 dB input SNR. Furthermore, there are musical noise and distortion presented in the enhanced speech based on spectrograms and waveforms analysis and also from informal listening test. We use white, pink and high frequency channel noises in order to show the performance of the proposed NWNS+EMD algorithm...|$|E

Here we describe the C. glabrata CYB 2 gene encoding lactate dehydrogenase as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> for survival in the intestine. CYB 2 {{was identified as a}} virulence factor by a silkworm infection study. To determine the function of CYB 2, we analysed in vitro phenotypes of the mutant Dcyb 2. The Dcyb 2 mutant grew well in glucose medium under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, was not supersensitive to nitric oxide which has fungicidal-effect in phagocytes, and had normal levels of general virulence factors protease, lipase and adherence activities. A previous report suggested that Cyb 2 p is responsible for lactate assimilation. Additionally, it was speculated that lactate assimilation was required for Candida virulence because Candida must synthesize glucose via gluconeogenesis under glucose-limited conditions such as in the host. Indeed, the Dcyb 2 mutant could not grow on lactate medium in which lactate is the sole carbon source in the absence of glucose, indicating that Cyb 2 p plays a role in lactate assimilation. We hypothesized that Cyb 2 p-mediated lactate assimilation is necessary for proliferation in the intestinal tract, as the intestine is rich in lactate produced by bacteria flora, but not glucose. The Dcyb 2 mutant showed 100 -fold decreased adaptation and few cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt in mouse ceca.

In turn, many ecological phenomena in the birds’ life patterns are directly {{dependent on the}} state of plumage (e. g., time of breeding, seasonal migration, roost flights). For the first time the quantitative characterization of six heron species' plumage were done as well as the description of powder down feathers. The adaptive features of feathers and various types of heron’s plumages were discussed. The structure of contour feathers of herons is related to the peculiarities of species life pattern. All the species have {{a relatively small number of}} contour feathers, despite their large body size. According to this index the herons are more similar to typical wading birds (gulls, sandpipers) than for waterfowl. The total number of heron feathers slightly increase in winter, because they are migratory species. Structure of contour feathers of herons corresponds to that of other waterbirds. The rod is not bent, the feathers are large, and the mounting angle to the surface of the body is little. The cores of abdominal feather fracts reduce heat transfer and can be regarded as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>factor</b> to aquatic environment. Buoyancy is provided by heron’s feathers insignificantly, in contrast to the typical waterfowl species. Significant subcutaneous fat stores are typical for herons in spring, autumn and winter, increased buoyancy and being the energy reserves provide thermoregulation in cold environment. Our data indicate weak adaptation of herons’ plumage to aquatic environments, but also confirm its insulating properties, which is prove the herons semi-aquatic rather than aquatic life patterns. Due to color of plumage some three groups of herons were considered: white, mottled and camouflaged. Coloration of second and third group performs a protective function. We didn’t found a clear connection between the color of feathers and aquatic life pattern; only motley herons have aqueous two-color sign: the belly is lighter than the bac...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} validating the estimated equivalent number of delivered source instructions determined using the Boehm <b>adaptation</b> adjustment <b>factor.</b> THE METHOD FOR ESTIMATING effort to adapt existing software using the <b>adaptation</b> adjustment <b>factor</b> will become more prevalent as software developers turn increasingly to reuse {{as a way to}} cut schedule and development costs. To determine the accuracy of our estimates, we must develop a method to assess completed projects, which includes reused, modified, and new source code, and compare this to our original estimation. This paper proposes a simple method for such an assessment. Due to the nature of modified code, the calculations in this paper are made in physical, rather than logical source, instructions. Background Determining the effort and schedule of proposed software wor...|$|R
