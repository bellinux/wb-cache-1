5|$|In April 2007, Bergkamp was {{inducted}} into the English Football Hall of Fame by viewers of BBC's Football Focus. A year later, he was voted second by Arsenal fans behind Thierry Henry in a list of the 50 Gunners Greatest Players. In February 2014, Arsenal unveiled a statue of Bergkamp outside the Emirates Stadium to honour his time at the club. A statue of Dennis Bergkamp will be erected outside the KNVB headquarters in Zeist, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> chosen as the best Dutch international player from 1990 to 2015. The statue will join those of the eleven of the century, erected in 1999, alongside statues of Johan Cruyff, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten, amongst others.|$|E

In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E

25|$|The commission's {{report states}} that {{during and after}} the investigation, several Palestinians {{cooperating}} with the Mission were detained by Israeli security forces. One of them was Muhammad Srour, a member of the Popular Committee Against the Wall in Nilin, who testified before the Mission in Geneva; en route back to West Bank he was arrested. After UN intervention, he was released. Israeli security sources said that Sruor was detained for questioning on suspicion that he was involved in terror activity and that his visit to Geneva had no bearing on the arrest. Another witness, Shawan Jabarin, General Director of the Palestinian human-rights organisation Al Haq, had to be heard by videoconference, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> subject to a travel ban by Israel since 2006 preventing him from leaving the West Bank on the grounds that he is {{a senior member of the}} Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.|$|E
500|$|As {{counsel for}} the prosecution, Hastings was the first {{barrister}} to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying {{that one of the}} things which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and [...] "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel sure that your sense of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit to sit in the House of Commons, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> guilty of fraud". Hastings then called Gruban to the witness stand, and asked him to tell the jury what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over David Lloyd George. Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.|$|E

By the time the others find Walter, Newton has already learned {{what he needs to}} know and escapes. Olivia manages to stop them, but is forced to choose between seizing Newton and saving Walter, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> given a lethal dose of a neurotoxin that will kill him unless Newton gives them the correct directions.

500|$|In a {{negative}} review, David Jeffries of Allmusic said that [...] "the glossy 'Lighters' {{feels more like}} a Bruno Mars track than Detroit diesel." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes critic Jakob Dorof stated that the hook is [...] "awful" [...] and sounds like [...] "If I Were a Boy". Dorof continued, [...] "It’s touching, in a Backstreet Boys meets [...] "Forever Young" [...] kind of way". He criticized Eminem for his rapping lyrics [...] "so long as he keeps rapping as fast and shoutingly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on every last verse he’s released {{in the past couple}} of years". Consequence of Sound's reviewer Winston Robbins gave a rather negative review on [...] "Lighters". Robbins believes that Mars' vocal delivery in the chorus does not fit into a rap song and would have done better on a solo record or with another artist, [...] "it is so far from home next to the hard verses of two of rap’s bad boys." [...] David Amidon from music website PopMatters said that [...] "Lighters" [...] was the only disappointing recording of the 11 tracks on the EP deluxe edition and [...] "it’s easy to press the skip button if you’d like to." [...] At the 2012 ASCAP Pop Music Awards it was awarded [...] "Most Performed Song".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept for}} making Rugal in The King of Fighters '94 {{was to make}} [...] "the mightiest (most violent) and most evil boss {{character}} ever". Despite the difficulties in defeating him, Rugal has become the boss character with the biggest number of appearances in The King of Fighters series <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> liked by players and developers. Due to his multiple [...] "deaths" [...] in the series, developers have joked with him, adding to his official profile that his hobby is resurrection. Flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, states that his fighting style was created to emphasize Rugal's strength as the series' first boss character. He also comments [...] "going a bit overboard" [...] with his Genocide Cutter technique damage ratio in The King of Fighters '94. His Dead-End Screamer special move was originally a technique in which Rugal breaks the neck of his opponent and crushes it. However, it was seen as lacking drama, so it evolved into a move in which he breaks his victim's neck, crushes the victim, and then further spins the victim around to do more damage, striking a pose {{at the end of}} the move. In The King of Fighters '95, Rugal appears as an enhanced version named Omega Rugal; developers liked him so much that they added him as the boss character in dream matches (KOF games with no storyline), commenting [...] "He's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss". His The King of Fighters '98 move set was noted to be strongest of all his appearances, becoming the developers' favorite boss character.|$|E
500|$|Against Boston College, {{running back}} Da'Rel Scott handled {{some of the}} kickoff return duties, but Smith {{returned}} two for 38yards. He also caught eight passes for 34yards and a touchdown. The following week, Maryland clinched bowl eligibility with a 62–14 rout of Wake Forest. Regarding the turnaround from the previous season's 2–10 record, Smith said, [...] "We {{expected to be in}} this position. No one else expected it," [...] but added [...] "No one is going to respect us [...] because we have not beaten any top dogs." [...] In the game, Smith had five catches for 66yards, including a 17-yard touchdown reception. Before the game against Miami, the coaching staff reported Smith's ankle had improved and he was [...] "as healthy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in a while." [...] Against Miami, he had three receptions for 35yards. Smith also compiled 46yards on two kickoff returns to break the ACC career kickoff return yards record with 2,724 yards, which surpassed the previous mark of 2,688 yards held by Brandon Tate of North Carolina. At Virginia, Smith took advantage of the Cavaliers' man-to-man coverage and had seven receptions for 157yards, including a 12-yard touchdown. On a 62-yard catch, he said he was tackled on the seven-yard line only because he was exhausted. Quarterback Danny O'Brien expressed his readiness to throw deep passes to Smith in single coverage, [...] "If it's even, I put it up." [...] Maryland entered the game against 25th-ranked Florida State in contention for the ACC Atlantic Division championship. Smith recorded a phone message and video appealing to fans in a bid to improve home attendance, which had been lackluster throughout the season. The game was attended by 48,115 spectators, which surpassed the athletic department's projections. Maryland lost, 30–16, and Smith had seven receptions for 69yards.|$|E

500|$|Fender {{completed}} the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey {{finished third in}} the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. Wisden described the team's success as [...] "nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. Wisden said: [...] "Essentially a change bowler —the best in England, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. Wisden praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: [...] "Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault." [...] During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered {{there was nothing wrong with}} his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.|$|E
