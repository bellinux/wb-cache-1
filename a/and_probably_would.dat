5|$|On the {{approach}} to and during an actual battle, a well-ordered formation was critical: if a fleet fell into disorder, its ships {{would be unable to}} lend support to each other <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be defeated. Fleets that failed to keep an ordered formation or that could not order themselves into an appropriate counter-formation (antiparataxis) to match that of the enemy, often avoided, or broke off from battle. Tactical manoeuvres were therefore intended to disrupt the enemy formation, including the use of various , such as dividing one's force and carrying out flanking manoeuvres, feigning retreat or hiding a reserve in ambush (Tactica, XIX.52–56). Indeed, Leo VI openly advised (Tactica, XIX.36) against direct confrontation and advocates the use of stratagems instead. According to Leo VI (Tactica, XIX.52), a crescent formation seems to have been the norm, with the flagship in the centre and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. A range of variants and other tactics and counter-tactics was available, depending on the circumstances.|$|E

It appears to have reached an early young adult stage at age seven, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have grown much larger when it reached the adult stage. This indicates a growth rate that is faster than in most large non-avian theropods.|$|E
25|$|Abortion {{was portrayed}} in 2001 {{with a story}} which divided the country when Kay decided to abort her {{pregnancy}} against {{the wishes of the}} father Malachy. As an older mother Kay has amniocentesis tests done which reveal the child has trisomy-13 which means that the child would be born severely disabled <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not survive long after birth. The storyline was seen by the actors and producers as controversial and heart-breaking. They recognised the time sensitive nature of the decisions that had to be made and the potential impacts and worked to show it all. This storyline caused anti-abortion viewers to complain to the Justice Minister {{on the grounds that the}} story was hate speech against people with disabilities.|$|E

25|$|Wallace-Johnson {{was arrested}} on 1 September 1939, {{the first day of}} World War II. Before then, the {{governor}} and his legal advisers were attempting {{to find a way to}} arrest and convict him for criminal libel, despite the lack of conclusive evidence favouring the prosecution. A series of six acts was passed by the Legislative Council, heavily restricting civil liberties. Added to the wartime emergency provisions, Wallace-Johnson could be arrested without justification. A trial was held without a jury (most of the jurors were WAYL supporters <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not vote for a conviction), and Wallace-Johnson was sentenced to 12 months in prison, eventually arriving at Sherbro Island. He was released in 1944. He returned to political activism, but found the WAYL in a state of disarray where tribal and regional issues, rather than the cause of unity that he championed, flourished. nevertheless he was the representative of the WAYL at the foundation of the Pan-African Federation, held in Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Petre {{believed}} that Hohenlohe's surrender was unnecessary and {{his chief of}} staff Massenbach was partly responsible. He thought that the Prussians could have fought their way into Stettin, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have if a strong-willed general like Blücher had been in command. The brigades of Hagen and Bila were not far away at the time and these forces might have helped prevent Murat from encircling Hohenlohe. Petre listed several criticisms of Hohenlohe. First, he marched too slowly from Burg and took too many detours to the north at the incompetent Massenbach's advice. It might have been possible for him to reach Prenzlau a day earlier, in which case he would have escaped Murat. Second, he kept too much cavalry and Hagen's infantry brigade on his left flank, where there were no enemies. Only Schimmelpfennig's weak brigade of 1,300 men was in the critical sector on the right flank. Third, his best troops marched in the rear guard with Blücher, while the major threat was on the right flank.|$|E
25|$|Captured French {{armoured}} tractors. The use {{of these}} tractors by the first wave units was intended to reduce their dependence upon horses <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have reduced the problems of getting supplies off the beaches. In addition to their proposed use on the beaches, the Germans later used them as tractors for antitank guns and munitions carriers, as self-propelled guns, and as armoured personnel carriers. There were two main types. The Renault UE Chenillette (German name: Infanterie Schlepper UE 630 (f)) was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940. Five to six thousand were built, and about 3,000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans. They had a storage compartment that could carry 350kg, pull a trailer weighing 775kg {{for a total of}} about 1000kg, and could climb a 50% slope. The armour was 5–9mm, enough to stop shell fragments and bullets. There was also the Lorraine 37L, which was larger, of which 360 fell into German hands. In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried, plus a 690kg trailer pulled for a total of 1.5 tonnes. The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised, with the first wave using 9.3% (4,200) of the 45,000 horses normally required.|$|E

500|$|Since the mid–1970s, {{references}} to Four Years Among the Cannibals {{have continued to}} appear in studies on New Guinea. In the 1990s, Detzner's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays, who placed Detzner's work in its contemporary context: [...] Four Years Among the Cannibals, he wrote, [...] "paved the way for me [...] by creating romanticized images {{that served as a}} backdrop for more serious readings". [...] Since then, geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions: [...] "Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his wonderful story? The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him {{as one of the great}} figures in New Guinea history." [...] Detzner had remained at large for four years, as a fugitive in enemy-held territory: surely, Linke concluded, this was an exceptional feat. No doubt the Australians could have made a more broadly organized attempt to capture him, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have succeeded, but they did not make the effort; they preferred instead the more convenient [...] "shoot-at-sight" [...] method. [...] "It is impossible", Linke wrote, [...] "not to admire his [...] sheer elan, his courage and tenacity." [...] In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, reprinted, and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.|$|E
500|$|The revised Stanley {{plan was}} {{presented}} to the Gray Commission on August 22. The Commission reconsidered its own proposals as well as the Stanley plan and those of other legislators (such as the Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans; see below for descriptions). Before the vote, Governor Stanley said he would not insist on the provision in the funding cut-off bill which would deny funds to all public schools statewide if a single local jurisdiction integrated. Also speaking before the group, Attorney General Almond said the McCue plan would not stop integration lawsuits <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> violate the state constitution. At the end of its meeting, the Gray Commission voted 19-to-12 to abandon its original proposals and support the Stanley plan. The meeting and vote were contentious. According to local news media, [...] "the Commission capitulated to tremendous pressure from state leaders to junk its own pupil assignment plan". The Commission also approved a program to provide tuition grants to students in shuttered school districts so they could attend a nonsectarian school of their choice. (The original Gray Commission plan awarded tuition grants only to parents in an integrated school system who did not want their child attending an integrated school, or to parents in localities which voluntarily closed their school system to avoid integration.) Thirteen of the 15 Southside legislators on the Gray Commission voted for the Stanley plan. Of the 12 commissioners who voted against the Stanley plan, two were from Arlington County, two were from Richmond, and one was from Norfolk. At the end of the session, Arlington's State Senator Charles R. Fenwick and delegate C. Harrison Mann proposed a series of bills designed to harass the Virginia NAACP, which Fenwick and others believed had instigated the desegregation lawsuits.|$|E

ADC then-communications director Hussein Ibish wrote that the extended definition trivialized the “very concept of anti-Semitism” and “smears and impugns the motives {{of all those who}} support the human and political rights of Palestinians.” A Merriam-Webster company spokesman stated that the older definition was not supported by current usage <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be dropped with publication of a new unabridged version by 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Talks {{opened with}} Macmillan {{detailing}} {{the history of}} the Anglo-American Special Relationship, going back to the Second World War. [...] He rejected the deal that Kennedy and Ormsby-Gore had reached. It would cost Britain about $100 million, and was not politically viable in the wake of recent public comments about Skybolt. Kennedy then offered Hound Dog. Macmillan turned this down on technical grounds, although it had not been subjected to a detailed assessment, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have worked for the RAF into the 1970s, as it did for the USAF.|$|E
2500|$|In early July 3, 1891, Jacob Kamm and his son, Charles T.

Potter, from making the scheduled time to Ilwaco. [...] On July 15, 1891, it was reported that Ocean Wave had been launched, that the boat had cost $70,000 to construct, and that it bore a “striking resemblance to the T.J. Potter” [...] The new steamer would make connections with the Ilwaco trains <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be run in opposition to the Union Pacific’s boat on the Portland-Ilwaco route.|$|E
2500|$|The castrati {{came in for}} a {{great amount}} of scurrilous and unkind abuse, and as their fame increased, so did the hatred of them. They were often castigated as malign creatures who lured men into {{homosexual}}ity. There were homosexual castrati, as Casanova's accounts of 18th-century Italy bear witness. He mentions meeting an abbé whom he took for a girl in disguise, only later discovering that [...] "she" [...] was a famous castrato. In Rome in 1762 he attended a performance at which the prima donna was a castrato, [...] "the favourite [...] " [...] of Cardinal Borghese, who dined every evening with his protector. From his behaviour on stage [...] "it was obvious that he hoped to inspire the love of those who liked him as a man, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have done so as a woman".|$|E

The motorway {{does not follow}} the straight route {{to the east of}} Middleton Cheney, meeting with the A422, as it had once been planned, due to a major landowner refusing his land to be cut in two. If built as planned, J11 would be east of Middleton Cheney, meeting with the A422, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have fuelled major growth in the village as well as Banbury, the primary destination of the junction. As it is, the junction was built [...] west along the A422, with the motorway skirting Banbury. The junction itself is a regular roundabout interchange, and has the single carriageway A361 from Daventry the dual-carriageway A422 from Brackley and the A43 from the west, and the dual-carriageway A422 (A361) toward Banbury feeding to/from it.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "wine" [...] spanned a broad {{spectrum}} of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. The finest wine was reserved for the upper classes of Rome. Below that was posca, a mixture of water and sour wine that had not yet turned into vinegar. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its low alcohol levels. Poscas use as soldiers' rations was codified in the Corpus Juris Civilis and amounted to around a liter per day. Still lower in quality was lora (modern-day piquette), which was made by soaking in water for a day the pomace of grape skins already pressed twice, and then pressing a third time. Cato and Varro recommended lora for their slaves. Both posca and lora were the most commonly available wine for the general Roman populace <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been for the most part red wines, since white wine grapes would have been reserved for the upper class.|$|E
2500|$|Albino Luciani's {{views on}} Humanae vitae have been debated. Journalist John L.

Moreover, as Patriarch in Venice some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues {{as the years went}} by." [...] According to Allen [...] "...it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae Vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching. It would have remained a more 'open' question". Other sources take a different view and note that during his time as Patriarch of Venice that [...] "Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception", though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and {{failed to live up to}} the Church's teaching. The book states that [...] "...if some people think that his compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against Humane Vitae one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception." ...|$|E
