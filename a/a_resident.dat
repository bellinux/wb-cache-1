40|$|In {{this chapter}} I {{investigate}} how {{the staff members}} of a mental health Therapeutic Community in Italy avoid displays of affiliation in response to residents’ indirect (or third party) complaints. I show how this restriction can be embodied in different practices: ignoring <b>a</b> <b>resident’s</b> turn carrying <b>a</b> possible complaint, avoiding attending the complaint-components of <b>a</b> <b>resident’s</b> turn, and disaffiliating with <b>a</b> <b>resident’s</b> complaint. I also discuss a deviant case in which affiliation is produced and is later treated by the staff members as a problematic stance to be produced following <b>a</b> <b>resident’s</b> complaint. I argue that through a restriction on affiliation the staff members implement the institutionally-relevant identity of intermediaries, whose task is to encourage the residents’ compliance to the decisions of absent third parties...|$|R
