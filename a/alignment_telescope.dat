40|$|Radiation {{temperature}} {{is an important}} parameter in characterizing the properties of hot plasmas. In most cases this {{temperature is}} time varying caused by the short lived and/or time dependent nature of the plasma. Thus, a measurement of the radiation flux {{as a function of}} time is quite valuable. To this end the authors have developed a spectrometer that can acquire spectra with a time resolution of less than 1 ns and covers the spectral energy range from {approximately} 60 to 1, 000 eV. The spectrometer consists of an entrance slit placed relatively near the plasma, a thin gold film transmission grating with aperture, a micro channel plate (MCP) detector with a gold cathode placed at the dispersion plane and an electron lens to focus the electrons from the MCP onto a phosphor coated fiber optic plug.

40|$|PaperPg. 8 - 12. Optical {{alignment}} is {{a technique}} which has proven its usefulness in original installation, repair and maintenance of turbomachinery. Optical alignment, {{sometimes referred to as}} optical tooling utilizes precision optical instruments, such as <b>alignment</b> <b>telescopes,</b> jig transits, precision sight levels, etc [...] rather than mechanical tools to determine straightness, flatness and squareness. The heart of the technique is an instrument with built-in optical micrometers for measuring displacement from a precise and referenced line of sight.

40|$|This poster {{presentation}} describes the Optical Attenuation Mechanism (OAM) Upgrades to the MOBLAS and TLRS Crustal Dynamics Satellite Laser Ranging (CDSLR) systems. The upgrades {{were for the}} purposes of preparing these systems to laser range to the TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft when it will be launched in the summer of 1992. The OAM permits the laser receiver to operate over the expected large signal dynamic range from TOPEX/POSEIDON and it reduces the number of pre- and post-calibrations for each satellite during multi-satellite tracking operations. It further simplifies the calibration bias corrections that had been made due to the pass-to-pass variation of the photomultiplier supply voltage and the transmit filter glass thickness. The upgrade incorporated improvements to the optical alignment capability of each CDSLR system through the addition of a CCD camera into the MOBLAS receive telescope and an <b>alignment</b> <b>telescope</b> onto the TLRS optical table.

40|$|Based on the {{successful}} Wavescope demonstration at MSFC {{at the end}} of March, the decision was made by the optical testing team to purchase an upgraded Wavescope from AOA. The MSFC version would include: a higher resolution camera (1000 x 1000 pixels); a higher density lenslet array (150 x 150); updated software; and longer cables (to accommodate the remote operation of the Wavescope optical head which was resident in the Beam Guide Tube). The AOA proposal for the new instrument was received in mid-April, and delivered to MSFC in mid-July. A considerable amount of effort was expended to provide the infrastructure needed for Wavescope operation, and to incorporate it into the overall test system. This was provided by the Wavescope System Pallet (WSP) built by UAH. The WSP is illustrated. Several instruments are incorporated on this pallet. These include the: Wavescope optical head; a PDI wavefront sensor; a point spread function sensor; a Leica light-based distance measuring sensor. In addition there is a single mode fiber point source (fed from a separate source pallet) which serves both as a reference for the Wavescope and as a source point for the test mirror. There is a dual function lens which both collimates the beam from the test image point, and images the test mirror onto the lenslet array. There is a high quality Collimator which can provide a flat input wavefront directly into the Wavescope. There are also various aids such as an alignment laser, an <b>alignment</b> <b>telescope,</b> alignment sticks and apertures. The WSP was delivered to MSFC on 7 / 28 / 99.

40|$|The simple {{addition}} of a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to a theodolite makes it safe to measure the pointing direction of a laser beam. The present {{state of the art}} requires this to be a custom addition because theodolites are manufactured without CCD cameras as standard or even optional equipment. A theodolite is an <b>alignment</b> <b>telescope</b> equipped with mechanisms to measure the azimuth and elevation angles to the sub-arcsecond level. When measuring the angular pointing direction of a Class ll laser with a theodolite, one could place a calculated amount of neutral density (ND) filters in front of the theodolite s telescope. One could then safely view and measure the laser s boresight looking through the theodolite s telescope without great risk to one s eyes. This method for a Class ll visible wavelength laser is not acceptable to even consider tempting for a Class IV laser and not applicable for an infrared (IR) laser. If one chooses insufficient attenuation or forgets to use the filters, then looking at the laser beam through the theodolite could cause instant blindness. The CCD camera is already commercially available. It is a small, inexpensive, blackand- white CCD circuit-board-level camera. An interface adaptor was designed and fabricated to mount the camera onto the eyepiece of the specific theodolite s viewing telescope. Other equipment needed for operation of the camera are power supplies, cables, and a black-and-white television monitor. The picture displayed on the monitor is equivalent to what one would see when looking directly through the theodolite. Again, the additional advantage afforded by a cheap black-and-white CCD camera is that it is sensitive to infrared as well as to visible light. Hence, one can use the camera coupled to a theodolite to measure the pointing of an infrared as well as a visible laser...|$|E

40|$|The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is a 6 -meter {{diameter}} telescope {{designed to}} make detailed measurements at millimeter wavelengths with arcminute resolution. The telescope is located {{at an altitude of}} 5, 190 meters in the Atacama desert in the Chilean Andes. The primary science instrument for ACT is the Millimeter Bolometer Array Camera (MBAC). MBAC measures the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy at angular scales corresponding to multipole 100 2 Ì 6 lsim; l 2 Ì 6 lsim; 10, 000. It contains three separate kilo-pixel arrays of transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in frequency bands centered at 145, 220, and 280 GHz. At small angular scales, the temperature anisotropies are dominated by interactions of CMB photons with large-scale structure on their transit from the surface of last scattering to the observer. The largest signal arises from the thermal Sunyaev-Zel 2 Ì 7 dovich (tSZ) effect, a spectral distortion of the CMB caused by inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons as they pass through hot gas in clusters of galaxies. By combining the millimeter-wave tSZ galaxy-cluster measurements with optical and X-ray data, the masses, temperatures, and redshifts of the clusters can be determined. The cluster density function (number counts as a function of redshift) will help map out the growth of structure in the universe. The measure of structure formation will help constrain the dark-energy equation of state. ^ My thesis discusses the scientific background and motivation for ACT. I present on overview of the telescope design, the alignment of the mirrors, and the choice of the site location and scan strategy. A detailed design of the MBAC receiver is given, including the integration of the bolometer arrays and their multiplexed readout; the cold, refractive, reimaging optics; the band-defining filters; the liquid-cryogens-free system employed to cool the optics and arrays; and the structural interface and alignment to the telescope.

Because of the finite lengths of the linkages that connect the mirror to the lateral supports, any shift in mirror position changes the amplitudes and directions of the applied forces with a resulting effect on the static balance and mirror figure.

40|$|To obtain imaging {{performance}} as for monolithic mirrors, large segmented reflectors used for astronomy must be actively aligned {{and pointed to}} extreme levels of precision. A system concept for a dual purpose optical truss laser metrology system is described which is used for both figure and <b>alignment</b> maintenance and <b>telescope</b> pointing. A two-stage figure active control approach was developed for several proposed spaceborne far infrared segmented telescopes, {{one of which is}} the 10 - 20 meters Large Deployable Reflector (LDR). The first active control stage, the figure initialization control system, aligns the optical elements (i. e., the primary segments, secondary and focal plane assembly) based on images obtained.
