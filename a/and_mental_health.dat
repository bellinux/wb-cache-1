40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} has described the factors that compromise <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> for transgender people, yet less information {{is known about the}} factors that promote resilience <b>and</b> protect <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> for transgender adults in Australia. This qualitative study aimed to increase knowledge and understanding about the broader context, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that compromise <b>and</b> promote the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of Australian transgender adults. Data were gathered using semistructured, one-on-one interviews with ten adult participants, including five transgender people <b>and</b> five <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> practitioners who specialize in gender diversity, and analysed using contemporary constructivist grounded theory methodology. Results indicated that the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of transgender adults in Australia is shaped by multi-layered interactions between broader context, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that perpetuate stigma and exclusion <b>and</b> compromise <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> as well as those that cultivate identity affirmation and inclusion <b>and</b> promote <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> wellbeing <b>and</b> quality of life.

40|$|Objective: Child <b>and</b> {{adolescent}} <b>mental</b> {{disorders are}} common, with a substantial disease burden, yet services {{for young people}} are nationally inadequate. As services {{should be based on}} policies and (or) plans, we analyzed the availability and content of child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> policies <b>and</b> plans in all provinces and territories. Method: The World Health Organization (WHO) framework for Child <b>and</b> Adolescent <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Policy <b>and</b> Plans was applied. Results: Four provinces in Canada have a child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> policy <b>and</b> (or) plan. The other provinces do not have a policy or plan in place, or else try to integrate these components into existing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> strategies. Among the policies and plans that exist, there is substantial variability regarding content as well as degree of adherence to the WHO template. Five essential content areas: legislation and human rights, information systems, quality improvement, improving access to and use of psychotropics, and human resource development and training are poorly or very poorly addressed in existing policies and (or) plans. Conclusion: This lack of specific policy and (or) plans for child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> the variability of content in plans that exist may help explain why child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services are poorly developed across Canada. We suggest that a national child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> policy framework be developed for Canada so that the provinces and territories may be encouraged to create or amend their current child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> frameworks in a manner that may enhance national cohesion and commonly addresses service needs in this population...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily.

Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common.
