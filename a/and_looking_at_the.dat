5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting her tail <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
5|$|Tandy {{drew the}} inside {{sketches}} {{for the first}} 26 volumes of the series as well as painting the covers of the first 26 volumes {{with the exception of}} volume 11– the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

25|$|TCM's view of {{the body}} places little {{emphasis}} on anatomical structures, but is mainly concerned with the identification of functional entities (which regulate digestion, breathing, aging etc.). While health is perceived as the harmonious interaction of these entities and the outside world, disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interaction. TCM diagnosis aims to trace symptoms to patterns of an underlying disharmony, by measuring the pulse, inspecting the tongue, skin, and eyes, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eating and sleeping habits of the person {{as well as many}} other things.|$|E

25|$|So far, {{there have}} been many interpretations for the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. Relating the events in a larger context of Vietnamese Buddhism in twentieth century <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{interactions}} between Diệm and Buddhist groups, Miller argues that the Buddhist protests during Diệm's regime were not only the struggles for discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom but also the resistances of Vietnamese Buddhism to Diệm's nation building policies centered by Personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power. Until the end of his life, Diệm, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, like what they had done with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the Bình Xuyên in 1955.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Singh was {{appointed}} by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as 'Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance' between October 2000 and November 2002. The position was established in 1993 and requires a review of around 1000 randomly chosen entry clearance refusals without a right of appeal <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> overall quality of refusal decisions, paying particular attention to fairness, consistency and the procedures used to reach those decisions. He makes random checks on some 800-1,000 visa refusals a year to see whether decisions are consistent and fair, and makes an annual report to the Parliament of the United Kingdom suggesting any improvements he thinks necessary. Singh is the second person to hold the job – his predecessor was Dame Elizabeth Anson. Rabinder Singh QC was also an independent member on a three-strong panel commissioned {{in the wake of}} the race row which erupted on Big Brother UK 2007 where Jade Goody and fellow housemates were accused of racist bullying towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E

500|$|In the beginning, the CDC did {{not have}} an {{official}} name for the disease, often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it, for example, lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus. They also used Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981. In the general press, the term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had been coined. The CDC, in search of a name, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> infected communities coined [...] "the 4H disease", as it seemed to single out homosexuals, heroin users, hemophiliacs, and Haitians. However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community, it was realized that the term GRID was misleading and AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982. By September 1982 the CDC started using the name AIDS.|$|E

The song [...] "È vero" [...] ("It's True") reached #8 on the Italian charts. Gino Paoli's song [...] "Il cielo in una stanza" [...] ("The Sky in a Room") {{marked the beginning of}} the young singer's transformation from a rock and roll shrieker to a feminine inspiration for cantautori. The idea for the song [...] "Love can grow at any moment at any place" [...] had come to Paoli while lying on a bed <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> purple ceiling. The single topped the list of annual sales in Italy and reached the Billboard Hot 100 as [...] "This World We Love In". Video performances of the song were included in the musicarellos Io bacio... tu baci and Appuntamento a Ischia, and in 1990, in the soundtrack of the film Goodfellas.|$|E

500|$|Based on {{southern}} Europe countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, Karnaca is warmer and sunnier than Dunwall. Reference photos were used {{from a variety}} of places to help design the city, including Cuba, Lyon and Malibu, California. The buildings in Karnaca frequently have flat roofs and more ornate windows. Photography from the 1920s was examined in order to help build a setting with a historical disposition, using reference websites like Shorpy.com <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> work of Agustín Casasola. Whereas Dishonored was largely built on the real world of 1837, Dishonored 2 draws ideas from [...] "the architectural forms, popular fashions, and far-out technologies" [...] of 1851. Arkane tried to take architectural concerns into account, and considered the effect the wind would have on the way the city developed, with energy being generated by wind turbines. Level designers and level architects collaborated throughout the entire production as locations were built. In making Karnaca, a style of Art Nouveau was applied.|$|E
