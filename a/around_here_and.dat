Music of all types, from live jazz to DJs spinning techno, {{can be found in the}} bars and nightclubs and there are a number of festivals and special outdoor concerts during the summer. Jazz is still the speciality <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> the Juan les Pins Jazz Festival is one of the best in the world.|$|E
2500|$|The centre {{became a}} target for terrorists. Arson attacks in April 1991 were {{followed}} by firebombs in December 1991 which caused extensive damage to four stores. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was blamed for the incidents, in which the devices were placed in soft furnishings during shopping hours.• After the second attack, Christmas shopping continued much as normal the following day in the unaffected stores. An unnamed fireman noted [...] "What bugs me is if there's a big one planted there's a lot of glass <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> {{a lot of people}} will be killed".|$|E
2500|$|The centre's profile, and the {{presence}} of several national chains, made it a target for terrorists. Arson attacks in April 1991 were followed by several firebombs in December 1991 which caused extensive damage to four stores. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was blamed for both incidents, in which the devices were placed in soft furnishings during shopping hours.• After the second, Christmas shopping continued much as normal the following day in the unaffected stores.

6000|$|... "I allow I'll {{stay with}} you lads till sunrise. It's a bit lonesome loafing <b>around</b> <b>here</b> alone, <b>and,</b> like you, I know of no place where I can find a bed. We'll hang {{together}} as neighbors should." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{hard for}} all of the {{soldiers}} and sailors to settle down, I'm thinking," [...] added Randy. [...] "A fellow can't knock <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> there, <b>and</b> everywhere for months and then come down to a regular routine all in a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|Breathe not, hid Heart: cease silently, [...] And though thy birth-hour beckons thee, [...] Sleep {{the long}} sleep: [...] The Doomsters heap [...] Travails <b>and</b> teens <b>around</b> us <b>here,</b> <b>And</b> Time-wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.|$|R
2500|$|On March 10, 2004 Lindner {{complained that}} critics of his remarks were not {{focusing}} on the real motives of his bill and his speech. He said [...] "that homosexuality, the rise in sexually transmitted diseases, and comprehensive sexual health education could prompt a future 'holocaust' in Minnesota". On the House floor he said, [...] "hat I am trying to prevent is the holocaust of our children getting STDs, AIDS, and various other diseases {{that are going to}} affect their lives. If you want to sit <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> wait until America becomes another African continent, well, then, you do that, but I'm {{going to do something about}} it." [...] Whatever his intentions, Lindner’s new remarks only managed to offend more Jews and Gays, while upsetting many African-Americans within Minnesota.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've waxed a few schools <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> {{maybe we}} can take a round out of Longley Academy," [...] Fred could not help but add.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{only knew}} where I had dropped them! But I don't know. They {{may be right}} <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> they may be half a mile away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Therefore," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{want your}} father to preside, {{and all of}} you to be happy, without a {{suspicion}} of a cloud about you. At any rate, I shall be no cloud. Come <b>around</b> <b>here</b> early, <b>and</b> see that everything is all right. Now I must be off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{is where}} we shall find the first signs, {{if there is any}} oil <b>around</b> <b>here.</b> Follow me, <b>and</b> sing out when you see any greasy-looking water in these little pools." ...|$|R
5000|$|Billboard was complimentary. [...] "Mathis {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{contemporary}} balladeers <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>here</b> he wisely sticks to his forte." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, most of {{the folks}} come <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> over across {{the way to the}} general stores. But I reckon the store-keepers won't like you around much." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{about ten}} minutes a gentle-faced middle-aged gentleman came along, and began to look <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there and under tables and everywhere, and I said to him, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but don't forget one thing, Giant. The shots {{will surely}} scare the game away from <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> {{that will mean}} good-by to the silver deer---at least for the present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best thing we can do," [...] said Snap, [...] "is to stay <b>around</b> <b>here</b> somewhere <b>and</b> start a good big camp-fire. If we try to get back to our camp we may get lost and also take our death of cold. The quicker we start a fire the better it will be for us." ...|$|R
50|$|Amongst the {{earliest}} known is that drawn Wyngaerde, produced <b>around</b> 1543, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> shown in 19th-century printed copies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} sent summonses to six men. I {{would rather have}} had two or three more, but young men are very scarce <b>around</b> <b>here</b> now; <b>and</b> as with you and myself that brings it up to eight {{that ought to be}} sufficient, as these fellows will have no time to summon any of their friends to their assistance. Have you a rifle, Captain Wingfield?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You clear out, Ham Spink, {{and leave}} us alone," [...] {{came in the}} voice of Giant. [...] "We don't want you <b>around</b> <b>here.</b> <b>And</b> we don't want you, either, Ike Akley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She owns Elmhurst, and has {{mortgages}} on a dozen farms <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> {{property in}} New York, {{and thousands of}} dollars in the bank," [...] he said. [...] "Aunt Jane's rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I didn't," [...] snapped Andrew Felps. [...] "Look here," [...] he continued. [...] "If {{this is a}} trick, let me warn you. You can't camp <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> that settles it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stenhouse said {{in victory}} lane that the win was [...] "a long time coming. We’ve run really well here at Talladega. This {{is the closest}} race track to home. I {{got a lot of}} cheers riding <b>around</b> <b>here</b> today <b>and</b> the fans were awesome. We had a lot packed in <b>here</b> at Talladega <b>and</b> it felt old-school. Man, to finally get that win for Jack (Roush) and {{everyone}} on our team is really special.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I must try," [...] said Jacob. So Jacob {{and the red}} {{one went}} <b>around</b> hunting <b>here</b> <b>and</b> hunting there until they scared up a hare. [...] "Shoot!" [...] said the red one; and Jacob shot. Clip! off flew the {{whiskers}} of the hare as neatly as one could cut them off with the barber's shears.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Woman's fancy manta, circa 1865. [...] "Navajo {{people believe}} in beauty all <b>around</b> <b>and,</b> <b>here,</b> this weaver is weaving her version of beauty.” —Sierra Ornelas, Navajo weaver.|$|R
6000|$|... "Providing we {{can follow}} his trail, Spud," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "You must remember {{there are a}} good many side roads <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> he can take to any one he pleases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now look here, Miner, if you {{was half}} a man, you'd pull out and leave this woman in peace. How {{you can stand}} <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> occupy the {{position}} you do, I don't see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we {{had better}} take in some sail," [...] said the old sailor. [...] "The yachts are pretty thick <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> we will miss the Flyaway without half trying unless we are careful." ...|$|E
60|$|Behold our trio, then, {{once more}} {{alone in the}} great forests of Madagascar--at least almost alone, for the Secretary was with them, for the double purpose of gaining {{instruction}} and seeing that the strangers did not lose themselves. As {{they were able to}} move about twice as fast as the host, they could wander <b>around,</b> <b>here,</b> there, <b>and</b> everywhere, or rest at pleasure without fear of being left behind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think worse of it {{than any}} of you,' he answered. 'They were {{shooting}} <b>around</b> <b>here</b> last night, <b>and</b> I heard the balls too. I said to myself, [...] "That's bad." [...] What gets me is why you should be making this row up at your end. I {{should be the first}} to go.' ...|$|R
50|$|Around 1870 Joseph Wills, a shepherd, is {{believed}} to have been the first to find tin in the New England district. These heavy black grains that he found near Elsmore aroused his curiosity. Shortly after selling these to a traveller from Sydney a rush began to search the tin fields <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> Inverell <b>and</b> other nearby areas. The Elsmore mine was the first commercial tin mine in Australia and has produced tin from various alluvial deposits intermittently since 1871. The adjacent Sheep Station Hill has seen only minor scale hard rock and alluvial mining.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish that}} myself, Mr. Sumner," [...] cried Hal. [...] "If he stole the tin box, then I am mostly responsible, {{although}} I supposed {{the man was}} some business man <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> was to be trusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I want to {{tell you}} that he has no right to {{interfere}} with me," [...] went on Napoleon Martell, uglily. [...] "Those peddlers are always hanging <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> my opinion is they are all thieves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is all right. Been {{married three}} times; buried two husbands, {{divorced}} from the third, and I hear she {{is getting ready to}} marry an old fellow out in Colorado somewhere. She's got children scattered <b>around</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there, most everywheres.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Arab Strap's {{first two}} albums, The Week Never Starts <b>Around</b> <b>Here</b> (1996) <b>and</b> Philophobia (1998), {{depicted}} the desperate decadence of post-Thatcherite Britain. The former album's [...] "The First Big Weekend", a five-minute piece of drunken mayhem that {{end with a}} joyous singalong, [...] "Went out for a weekend, lasted forever / Got high with our friends, it's officially summer," [...] which was the chorus to [...] "Hey!Fever," [...] one of the tracks on the EP The Girls of Summer. The 1999 live album, Mad for Sadness, demonstrated how the sometimes spare recorded sound of their early music could lift into a celebration of a sexually empty, drug- and alcohol-dependent life.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{entered the}} gates, rang the bell, <b>and</b> looked <b>around.</b> <b>Here</b> the trees <b>and</b> rooks seemed older, if possible, {{than those in}} the Close behind him. Everything was dignified, and he felt himself like Punchinello in the king's chambers. Verily in the present case Glanville was not a man to stick at trifles any more than his illustrious prototype; and on the servant {{bringing}} a message that his lordship would see him at once, Louis marched boldly in.|$|R
5000|$|Besides children, adults also gather <b>around</b> <b>here</b> for conversations <b>and</b> social bonding. Madam Yee, a {{resident}} of more than 35 years, said, “What I like most about this place is the friendship that I’ve forged throughout the years. I live alone and it’s good that my neighbours check up on me when they have the time. Sometimes if I get bored, I {{go down to the}} playground and chitchat with them. When all of us have to shift out in 2016, hopefully, the bond between our neighbours will remain intact.” ...|$|R
