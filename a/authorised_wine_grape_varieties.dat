40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Degree Thesis was {{to monitor}} {{the total number of}} lactic acid {{bacteria}} occurring in <b>grape</b> must during <b>wine</b> production. The study was performed on the red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> Cabernet Moravia from organic vineyard and on the white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> Sauvignon from both organic and integrated vineyards. The isolation of pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria from mixed cultures and subsequently their identification by genus and species-specific PCR was also subject of the thesis. The experimental results show that the number of viable cells of lactic acid bacteria is influenced not only by the <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety,</b> whether it is a variety of red or white <b>wine</b> <b>grape,</b> but also by the way of wine growing. The method of wine growing also {{had an impact on the}} species representation of lactic acid bacteria in each variety...|$|R
