2500|$|In Germany after World War I, {{psychology}} held institutional {{power through}} the military, and subsequently expanded {{along with the}} rest of the military under the Third Reich. Under the direction of Hermann Göring's cousin Matthias Göring, the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute was renamed the Göring Institute. Freudian psychoanalysts were expelled and persecuted under the anti-Jewish policies of the Nazi Party, and all psychologists had to distance themselves from Freud and Adler. The Göring Institute was well-financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a [...] "New German Psychotherapy". This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the overall goals of the Reich; as described by one physician: [...] "Despite the importance of analysis, spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the Volk and the Gemeinschaft." [...] Psychologists were to provide Seelenführung, leadership of the mind, to integrate people into the new vision of a German community. Harald Schultz-Hencke melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology and racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed. Johannes Heinrich Schultz, a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of <b>autogenic</b> <b>training,</b> prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, and devised techniques for facilitating this process. After the war, some new institutions were created and some psychologists were discredited due to Nazi affiliation. Alexander Mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called Psyche and with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University. In 1970, psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students.|$|E

40|$|In space, {{there is}} a need to monitor astronauts' vital signs and assess their {{readiness}} to perform specific tasks during a mission. Currently, NASA does not have the capability to noninvasively monitor crew for extended periods of time. The Canadian Space Agency is working with the Psychophysiology Lab at NASA ARC to determine if the Astroskin could be used as a solution to this problem. Astroskin, a commercially available garment with built-in biosensors, can be comfortably worn under clothing or a spacesuit and relay information to the crewman's own mobile device. Data can also be sent wirelessly to the on-board Exploration Medical System. To determine if Astroskin meets requirements for health monitoring, it must first be validated in spaceflight analog environments. In the current study Astroskin data will be compared to traditional biomedical instrument measures of electrocardiography (ECG), respiration rate, and systolic blood pressure. The data will be recorded during <b>Autogenic</b> Feedback <b>Training</b> Exercise (AFTE), which is a type of physiological self-regulation training designed for astronauts.

5000|$|Schultz's {{most famous}} {{achievement}} was {{the development of}} <b>autogenic</b> <b>training,</b> {{that was based on}} the hypnosis research and self-experimentation. It was first publicly put forward in 1926 as [...] "autogenic organ exercises", and received its current name in 1928. The program consists of a set of six mental exercises that target specific bodily reactions that are believed to underpin body-mind health. It is a myth that <b>autogenic</b> <b>training</b> is a technique based on creative visualisations. Rather, it is a technique that revolves around a set of sub-vocal instructions to different parts of the body with the trainee simply observing in a completely non-striving way the changes in the way the body feels. It is a passive process, unlike creative visualisations, which rely upon a more active cognitive state. Today, because of Schultz' contribution to body-mind health, <b>autogenic</b> <b>training</b> is practiced worldwide. NASA teaches AT to their astronauts to help them with the psychophysiological stressors of space travel. In Australia, UK, Italy and Spain AT is taught to assist with problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, anger management, insomnia, fatigue and for difficulties with concentration, memory, decision making amongst other things. In Japan and Germany, medical practices teach AT to assist with the treatment {{of a wide range of}} medical complaints.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to evaluate a methodology designed to accurately trace the temporal progression of motion sickness and space motion sickness symptoms. With this method, subjects continuously monitor their own motion sickness symptoms during exposure to a provocative stimulus as symptoms occur, in contrast to previous methods during which subjects report symptoms verbally at discrete time intervals. This method not only is comparable to previous methods {{in the type of}} symptoms that subjects report, but subjects report symptoms more frequently. Frequent reporting of motion sickness symptoms allows researchers to detail the waxing and waning of motion sickness symptoms for each individual. Previous research has shown that physiological responses to motion sickness stimuli are characterized by unique individual differences in response patterns. By improving our assessment of motion sickness symptoms with continuous monitoring of symptoms, the relationship between specific physiological responses and sickness levels can be more accurately determined for each individual. Results from this study show significant positive relationships between skin conductance levels and symptom levels for ten individuals; a significant positive relationship between temperature and symptom levels for 5 of 10 individuals; and both positive and negative relationships between respiration, heart rate, blood volume pulse and symptom levels. Continuous monitoring of motion sickness symptoms can be used to more accurately assess motion sickness to aid in the evaluation of countermeasures. In addition, recognition of the onset of symptoms that are strongly related to specific physiological responses could be used as cues to initiate procedures (e. g., <b>Autogenic</b> Feedback <b>Training)</b> to prevent the development of severe motion sickness symptoms...|$|R

The study was carried out to  investigate the effectiveness of ART in providing a method of coping with individual stress. Analyses were made  between and within an ART group of student nurses and a comparison group who did not receive training in  ART. Consideration was also given to individual differences of student nurses in each group. Particular attention was paid to the hypotheses that 1) ART is associated with reduced sickness absence in  student nurses when analysed against a comparison group' of student nurses not trained in ART; and 2) ART is  associated with reduced stress in student nurses when compared with student nurses not trained in ART. 'It  is generally concluded that student nurses trained in ART may reduce their level of sickness absence and can  alleviate stress for some student nurses. However, examination of individual student nurse reports of ART and  its usefulness and practice within these group data, suggest more complex interpretations of the study. Despite  the study limitations, implications for methods of stress control for nurses, curriculum development and  cost-effective savings for nursing administrations are suggested, and possibilities for the development of  comprehensive counselling services for nurses are raised. These issues it is suggested, should be examined within a broader programme of research into coping with stress amongst nurses...|$|R
