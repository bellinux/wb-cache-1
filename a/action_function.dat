40|$|Over nine {{experiments}} I investigated young children’s {{ability to}} learn the names, <b>actions</b> and <b>functions</b> associated with artefacts. Experiment 1 examined whether children, performing a referent selection task, attach a novel action to a novel referent (i. e., applied mutual exclusivity). Children chose the novel artefact significantly more often than chance. Experiments 2 and 3 used tests of comprehension and extension to investigate whether children fast map novel artefact names and actions. I used a strict definition of fast mapping: incidental learning, minimal exposure, and long term retention. Accuracy was above chance, with {{no significant differences between}} action and naming. Experiments 4, 5 and 6 created and refined a methodology designed to study children's ability to fast map an artefact’s name, <b>action</b> and <b>function.</b> Following brief incidental exposure to an artefact’s use (i. e., making a music box play), 3 - and 5 -years-olds were equally likely to fast map a novel name, <b>action</b> and <b>function.</b> In a more challenging task, with just one demonstration of the novel artefact information, 3 -year-olds found action easiest to remember in a test of comprehension. Experiment 7 investigated 4 -year olds’ production of names and actions after a brief exposure. Actions were produced substantially better than names. Experiment 8 used referent selection tasks to further test 3 -year-olds’ mutually exclusive behaviour. Once again, performance with name, <b>action</b> and <b>function</b> did not differ. This suggests children believe that artefacts are associated with a specific name, <b>action</b> and <b>function,</b> and that these are characteristic features of an artefact category. Experiment 9 investigated which of these features we regard as defining category membership: 3 -year-olds tend to categorise by shape, whereas older children (and adults) prefer function. Overall, my data suggest that young children are excellent learners of artefact information, although the way humans categorise artefacts may change during later development...|$|R

50|$|The request {{processor}} {{consists of}} the server process' main loop {{and a number of}} state machines. State machines are based on a simple language developed for PVFS that manage concurrency within the server and client. A state machine consists of a number of states, each of which either runs a C state <b>action</b> <b>function</b> or calls a nested (subroutine) state machine. In either case return codes select which state to go to next. State action functions typically submit a job via the job layer which performs some kind of I/O via Trove or BMI. Jobs are non-blocking, so that once a job is issued the state machine's execution is deferred so that another state machine can run servicing another request. When Jobs are completed the main loop restarts the associated state machine. The request processor has state machines for each of the various request types defined in the PVFS request protocol plus a number of nested state machines used internally. The state machine architecture makes it relatively easy to add new requests to the server in order to add features or optimize for specific situations.|$|E

Bohm and Hiley used the word holomovement for the underlying activity in the various orders together. This term is intended to extend beyond the movement of objects in space and beyond the notion of process, covering movement in a wide context such as for instance the [...] "movement" [...] of a symphony: [...] "a total ordering which involves the whole movement, past and anticipated, at any one moment". This concept, which avowedly has similarities with the notion of organic mechanism of Alfred North Whitehead, underlies Bohm and Hiley´s efforts to establish algebraic structures that relate to quantum physics and to find an ordering that describes thought processes and the mind.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goals in}} Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak are to defeat Spat {{once and for}} all and to repair all the {{destroyed}} relations. A third quest, that supports those two, is to obtain all the [...] "Ham-Chats". Ham-Chats are words, but also much more than that. At the start of the game, Hamtaro accidentally causes almost all the Ham-Chats in his Ham-Ham Dictionary to vanish, starting the hunt to fill the dictionary. Each Ham-Chat represents both a word (for communicating) and an action and/or motion. For instance, Lookie means to look. It {{is one of the most}} common Ham-Chats in the game, and solely has an <b>action</b> <b>function.</b> In that sense, action Ham-Chats often come with the necessary item (which is part of the Ham-Chat motion and doesn't show up in the inventory) and therefore, go another way than other adventure games in which the player already has all the actions available, but still has to get the required items. The other kind of Ham-Chat can only be used in conversations. A Ham-Chat like Perksie (Listen) for instance, only has value for conversations. New Ham-Chats are necessary to gain access to new parts of a conversation and get another Ham-Ham to do or give something.|$|E
