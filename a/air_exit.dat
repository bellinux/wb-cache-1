40|$|We {{perform the}} first {{analysis}} of stratosphere-troposphere exchange {{in terms of}} distributions that partition the one-way flux across the thermal tropopause according to stratospheric residence time τ and the regions where <b>air</b> enters and <b>exits</b> the stratosphere.

Suitable integrations of the flux distribution are {{used to determine the}} stratospheric mean residence time inline image and the mass fraction of the stratosphere in any given residence time interval.

We also explore the sensitivity of the stratosphere-troposphere exchange to changes in the circulation by increasing the amplitude of the topography. The resulting more vigorous residual mean circulation dominates over increased eddy diffusion, leading to decreased inline image except for <b>air</b> <b>exiting</b> at high NH latitudes, for which inline image increases.

40|$|The invention, {{a static}} phase {{separator}} (SPS), uses airflow and capillary wetting characteristics to passively separate a two-phase (liquid and air) flow. The device accommodates highly variable liquid wetting characteristics. The resultant design {{allows for a}} range of wetting properties from about 0 to over 90 advancing contact angle, with frequent complete separation of liquid from gas observed when using appropriately scaled test conditions. Additionally, the design accommodates a range of air-to-liquid flow-rate ratios from only liquid flow to over 200 : 1 air-to-liquid flow rate. The SPS uses a helix input section with an ice-cream-cone-shaped constant area cross section (see figure). The wedge portion of the cross section is on {{the outer edge of the}} helix, and collects the liquid via centripetal acceleration. The helix then passes into an increasing cross-sectional area vane region. The liquid in the helix wedge is directed into the top of capillary wedges in the liquid containment section. The transition from diffuser to containment section includes a 90 change in capillary pumping direction, while maintaining inertial direction. This serves to impinge the liquid into the two off-center symmetrical vanes by the airflow. Rather than the airflow serving to shear liquid away from the capillary vanes, the design allows for further penetration of the liquid into the vanes by the air shear. This is also assisted by locating the <b>air</b> <b>exit</b> ports downstream of the liquid drain port. Additionally, any droplets not contained in the capillary vanes are re-entrained downstream by a third opposing capillary vane, which directs liquid back toward the liquid drain port. Finally, the dual <b>air</b> <b>exit</b> ports serve to slow the airflow down, and to reduce the likelihood of shear. The ports are stove-piped into the cavity to form an unfriendly capillary surface for a wetting fluid to carryover. The liquid drain port is located at the start of the containment region, allowing for draining the bulk fluid in a continuous circuit. The functional operation of the SPS involves introducing liquid flow (from a human body, a syringe, or other source) to the two-phase inlet while an air fan pulls on the <b>air</b> <b>exit</b> lines. The fan is operated until the liquid is fully introduced. The system is drained by negative pressure on the liquid drain lines when the SPS containment system is full...|$|E

When the thermal length scale of the supply jet was >> 1, temperature stratification was minor for all tested heat densities and air distribution methods. Significant vertical temperature gradients occurred when the jet thermal length scale was << 1.
