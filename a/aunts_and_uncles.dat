500|$|With {{his parents}} and {{siblings}} in exile, Alexander found himself isolated. The royals remained unpopular with the Venizelists, and Entente representatives advised the king's <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> particularly Prince Nicholas, to leave.

500|$|Coward was no fan of {{the works}} of Gilbert and Sullivan, but as a {{songwriter}} was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: [...] "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them... my <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation." [...] His colleague Terence Rattigan wrote that as a lyricist Coward was [...] "the best of his kind since W. S. Gilbert." ...|$|E

[...] By the time of the American Revolution, six of the ten largest slaveholders in the lower Cape Fear region were in some way related to Moore. [...] The Moore family relied on the production of naval stores and lumber, as the lower Cape Fear was unsuited to mass cultivation of more profitable products and crops like rice and indigo.|$|E

500|$|The American and British musical owes a {{tremendous}} debt to G, who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll, Adrian Ross, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Gilbert's lyrics {{served as a}} model for such 20th-century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, and Lorenz Hart. Noël Coward wrote: [...] "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth....

500|$|Mathew Charles Lamb {{was born}} in Windsor, Ontario on 5 January 1948, {{the only child of}} a 15-year-old mother who {{abandoned}} him soon after birth. Raised by an assortment of grandparents, <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins. According to interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a [...] "little [...] ".

Charles Brundage was a stonecutter; the Brundages moved to Chicago when Avery was five, and Charles Brundage soon {{thereafter}} abandoned his family. Avery and his younger brother, Chester, were mostly raised by <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncles.</b> At age13, in 1901, Brundage finished first in an essay competition, winning a trip to President William McKinley's second inauguration. Avery attended Sherwood Public School and then R. T.Crane Manual Training School, both in Chicago. Crane Tech was a journey of [...] by public transportation, which he undertook only after completing a newspaper delivery route. Even though the school had no athletic facilities, Brundage made his own equipment (including a shot and a hammer to throw) in the school's workshop and by his final year was written of in the newspapers as a schoolboy track star. According to sportswriter William Oscar Johnson in a 1980 article in Sports Illustrated, Brundage was [...] "the kind of man whom Horatio Alger had canonized—the American urchin, tattered and deprived, who rose to thrive {{in the company of}} kings and millionaires".|$|E
500|$|Fuller {{began her}} formal {{education}} at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she {{was sent to the}} School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the advice of <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature. By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, [...] "I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot." [...] Eliza Farrar, wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of The Young Lady's Friend (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Joseph Carey Merrick was born, apparently healthy, {{and had no}} outward {{symptoms of}} any disorder {{for the first few}} years of his life.

The Merricks had two more children not three as stated on his mothers grave,John Thomas (born 21 April 1864 did indeed die of smallpox 24 July of the same year) but he was not related to Joseph and Mary Jane [...] Merrick.

When writing of in his book The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, Ashley Montagu states that [...] " [...] Merrick was born on 21 April 1864". Montagu believed Treves's statement in his book The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences that Merrick's first name was John, not Joseph, and confused him with his younger brother, a child which has now been proved was not related to Joseph Merrick.|$|E

2500|$|The {{complexity}} of these etiquette rules extends to specific mourning periods and attire for siblings, step-parents, <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncles</b> distinguished by blood and by marriage, nieces, nephews, {{first and second}} cousins, children, infants, and [...] "connections" [...] (who were entitled to ordinary mourning {{for a period of}} [...] "1–3 weeks, depending on level of intimacy").

Widowers were expected to mourn for a mere three months, whereas the proper mourning period expected for widows was up to four years. Women who mourned in black for longer periods were accorded great respect in public for their devotion to the departed, the most prominent example being Queen Victoria herself.|$|E
