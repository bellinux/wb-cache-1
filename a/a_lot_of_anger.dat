Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow.

The DRC {{is a country}} of {{extraordinary}} natural wealth but this wealth has never been used {{for the benefit of}} the Congolese population. Instead, the country is currently emerging from one of the world's worst conflicts, which has resulted in the deaths of up to 3. 5 million people. This conflict has been fuelled mainly by competition for natural resources, which has been used to fund numerous rebel groups. The conflict centered in the east of the country, it involved a range of militant groups; local militias, Congolese and Rwandan rebels and the Congolese army, that use control over the country's rich mineral deposits as a source of financing. Qualitative Research Methodology was the choice of method. Data was collected from primary and secondary sources. A sample of one hundred participants was used to respond to open-ended questions and four interviewee. It is evident that natural resources played a key role in prolonging the civil conflict and also being the cause of it because resources have been a source of finance to rebel groups to purchase necessary tools that were used during conflict. The country has been targeted by external interference that has divided the country in an effort to benefit from natural resources through aiding or bribing a certain powerful group in order to pursue their interests, and this has built <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> grievances and <b>anger</b> in the lower group because they don't benefit from their resources and that leads to a startup of conflict.

The interpreter is a legal interpreter for French, based in Turkey, sitting in a courtroom equipped with VC equipment, while in the remote site in Brussels there are a prosecutor, a witness (the friend of the accused person) and a technician. The case is a very simple one: the accused person in Turkey refuses to be heard by videoconference and this message should be communicated to the other site in Brussels. The technical conditions were tested the day before so that everything was prepared to make the hearing run smoothly. With regard to the technical aspects, everything was prepared, tested and approved beforehand. Not even a single technical problem occurred.

A striking example shows that the Turkish legal professionals tried to behave during the VC session as if it were a face-to-face setting, without realizing that - except for the magistrate and the legal interpreter - nobody was visible for the participants on the Belgian side. Finally, we will discuss methodological issues (simulations and experiments vs. real-life case studies) and we will also try to formulate recommendations for both legal professionals and legal interpreters on how to handle VC hearings, based on the case study.

[...] Edward also agreed that Zac was led astray by women and often focused too heavily on them. A new side of Zac was shown in April when he openly and continuously pursued a sexual relationship with Vasa (Teuila Blakely) despite his partnership with Sarah (Amanda Billing). Upon accepting the return to the role, Edward was aware that Zac would be a [...] "love-rat" [...] but did not realize the extent of the villainy he was going to undergo.

40|$|The corpus we want {{to examine}} is a very {{specific}} and rather exceptional one: it is an authentic video recording of a court case in Belgium (Flanders). More specifically, it concerns a hearing of a witness via videoconferencing (VC). The hearing took place between Brussels (Belgium) and Innsbruck (Austria). The interpreter is a legal interpreter for Dutch, based in Austria, sitting in a courtroom equipped with VC equipment, while the witness is in Brussels accompanied by a prosecutor, a police officer and a technician. The case was a supposedly simple testimony in an assault case during a skiing holiday in the Austrian Alps. The technical conditions were tested the day before so that everything was prepared to make the hearing run smoothly. Nevertheless, this routine hearing {{turned out to be}} a failure with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> frustration and <b>anger</b> on both sides because of the bad quality of the interaction, and the lack of professionalism of both the legal interpreter and the legal professionals. The actual length of the hearing exceeded the estimated length (i. e. 20 minutes) and took almost 5 times as long. This timing clearly points at a low degree of efficiency. In our chapter, we would like to present a transcription of (part of) the interaction. We will focus on the main reasons for this failing interaction. -We will present a quantitative analysis of the number of interpreting errors (to be defined as omissions, additions and problems with accuracy) but also of linguistic problems and problematic paralinguistic items like turn-taking and overlap. We also want to analyze the audio-visual parameters (e. g. both technical and visual (gaze)). Finally, we will pay attention to the behavior of the legal professionals (ethical code and professionalism). A striking example shows that the Austrian legal professionals tried to behave during the VC session as if it were a face-to-face setting, without realizing that - except for the magistrate and the legal interpreter - nobody was visible for the participants on the Belgian side. Our ultimate aim is to compare our findings based on this real case with the results of the Avidicus 1 & 2 project. We would like to compare the simulated role-plays of Avidicus 1 & 2 with our real case. In the Avidicus roleplay, the interpreter and the legal professional are in the same place while the witness is at a remote location. It would be interesting to find out whether the results will be similar or rather divergent. In the end, we will discuss methodological issues (simulations and experiments vs. real life case studies) but we will also try to formulate recommendations for both legal professionals and legal interpreters on how to handle VC hearings, based on the case study.
