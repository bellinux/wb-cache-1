40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} terminal understeer and its mitigation via integrated brake control. The scenario considered is when a vehicle enters a curve at a speed that is too high for the tyre-road friction limits and an optimal combination of braking and cornering forces is required to slow the vehicle down and to negotiate the curve. Here, the driver commands a step steering input, from which a circular <b>arc</b> <b>reference</b> path is inferred. An optimal control problem is formulated with an objective to minimize the maximum off-tracking from the reference path, and two optimal control solutions are obtained. The first is an explicit analytical solution for a friction-limited particle; the second is a numerically derived open-loop brake control sequence for a nonlinear vehicle model. The particle solution {{is found to be}} a classical parabolic trajectory associated with a constant acceleration vector of the global mass center. The independent numerical optimization for the vehicle model is found to approximate closely the kinematics of the parabolic path reference strategy obtained for the particle. Using the parabolic path reference strategy, a closed-loop controller is formulated and verified against the solution from numerical optimization. The results are further compared with understeer mitigation by yaw control, and the parabolic path reference controller is found to give significant improvement over yaw control for this scenario.

Historical records indicate that it was severely affected {{by a number of}} tsunami events.

We identify three main seismic sources: the western Hellenic <b>Arc</b> (WHA – <b>reference</b> event AD 365, M w = 8. 5), the eastern Hellenic <b>Arc</b> (EHA – <b>reference</b> event 1303, M w = 8. 0) and the Cyprus Arc (CA – hypothetical scenario earthquake with M w = 8. 0), inferred from the tectonic setting and from historical tsunami catalogues. All numerical simulations are carried out in two sea level conditions (mean sea level and maximum high-tide sea level) by means of the code UBO-TSUFD, developed and maintained by the Tsunami Research Team of the University of Bologna. Relevant tsunami metrics are computed for each scenario and then used to build aggregated fields such as the maximum flood depth and the maximum inundation area. We find that the case that produces the most relevant flooding in Alexandria is the EHA scenario, with wave heights up to 4 m. The aggregate fields are used for a building vulnerability assessment according to a methodology developed in the framework of the EU-FP 6 project SCHEMA and further refined in this study, based on the adoption of a suitable building damage matrix and on water inundation depth.

Methods Twenty-nine SBRT plans of primary liver (n = 11) and lung (n = 18) tumors were the basis of this study. Five-millimeter leaf width 120 -leaf Varian Millennium (M 120) MLC-based plans served as reference, and were designed using static conformal beams (3 DCRT), sliding-window intensity-modulated beams (IMRT), or dynamic conformal <b>arcs</b> (DCA). <b>Reference</b> plans were either re-optimized or recomputed, with identical planning parameters, for a 2. 5 -mm width 120 -leaf BrainLAB/Varian high-definition (HD 120) MLC system. Dose computation was based on the anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA, Varian Medical Systems) with tissue heterogeneity taken into account. Each plan was normalized such that 100 % of the prescription dose covered 95 % of the planning target volume (PTV). Isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were computed and plans were evaluated with respect to target coverage criteria, normal tissue sparing criteria, as well as treatment efficiency. Results Dosimetric differences achieved using M 120 and the HD 120 MLC planning were generally small. Dose conformality improved in 51. 7 %, 62. 1 % and 55. 2 % of the IMRT, 3 DCRT and DCA cases, respectively, with use of the HD 120 MLC system. Dose heterogeneity increased in 75. 9 %, 51. 7 %, and 55. 2 % of the IMRT, 3 DCRT and DCA cases, respectively, with use of the HD 120 MLC system. DVH curves demonstrated a decreased volume of normal tissue irradiated to the lower (90 %, 50 % and 25 %) isodose levels with the HD 120 MLC. Conclusion Data derived from the present comparative assessment suggest dosimetric merit of the high definition MLC system over the millennium MLC system. However, the clinical significance of these results warrants further investigation in order to determine whether the observed dosimetric advantages translate into outcome improvements. </p...|$|R

40|$|Bulk (RE) BCO {{materials}} (where RE denotes a rare-earth ion) {{are known}} to be used as strong permanent magnets in various engineering devices, such as magnetic bearings or rotating machines. In so doing, the bulk pellet is usually magnetized along its c-axis and a permanent magnetic moment is trapped. In real application, however, the pellet is likely to be subjected to small parasitic magnetic fields that cause a decay of the permanent magnetic moment. The most severe effects arise when the pellets are subjected to ac magnetic field cycles that are perpendicular to their c- axis (“crossed-fields” configuration). Our previous works relate to a small number of transverse cycles of large amplitude. In the present work we consider a large number (> 10 ^ 4) of cycles of small amplitude, which is closer to practical situations. The study is carried out on bulk single grain GdBCO pellet. The samples are two 10 mm height and 15 mm diameter cylinders, one of which is surrounded by a 2 mm thick stainless steel reinforcement ring. The transverse field is sinusoidal, its frequency ranges between 10 Hz and 800 Hz and its amplitude ranges between 5 mT and 50 mT. The resulting decay of the axial magnetization of the samples is recorded against time and flux-creep effects are subtracted. Thermocouples are placed at several locations on the samples surface to probe possible heating. For these small amplitudes of the magnetic field, corresponding to only few percents of the penetration field, results show that the magnetization decay depends mainly on the time during which the transverse field is applied. This is in contrast with results obtained at larger amplitudes of the magnetic field and for which the decay is linked to the number of cycles. We also show that the natural relaxation of the axial magnetization is strongly affected or even suppressed after a short time exposition to the transverse ac magnetic field.

Compared to conventional permanent magnets, however, the magnetic field generated by a superconducting trapped field magnet is much more sensitive to the presence of an external field that is not perfectly aligned with the superconductor magnetic moment, i. e. when the external field has a transverse component. A situation where the superconductor experiences a magnetic field with a transverse component is likely to happen several times during running operation of the device. As an example, in a “trapped flux” synchronous machine, any variation of the load of the shaft may lead to a slight misalignment of the magnetic moment of the superconductor (placed in the rotor) with respect to the rotating field (generated by the stator). In such a situation, the superconductor is subjected to a rotating field, and the situation is likely to be different from a situation where the superconductor is subjected to a pure transverse field. In the present work, we aim at examining different scenarios (i. e. transverse or rotating) where the trapped field magnet is subjected to a transverse component. These configurations are examined both experimentally and numerically. The numerical model is used to determine the distribution of currents in the cross-section of the superconductor. We examine the conditions where the rotating field leads to a partial remagnetization of the sample and is therefore less detrimental that the application of a pure transverse field. We also show that the magnetic moment of the sample may behave differently that the field at the surface of the superconductor. Finally, we investigate the behavior of structures where the superconductor is attached to a thin ferromagnetic disk, and show the beneficial effect of such hybrid structures compared to the superconductor alone.

40|$|Background: The {{last few}} years, in {{radiotherapy}} {{there has been}} a growing focus on speed of treatment delivery (largely driven by economical and commercial interests). This study investigates the influence of treatment time on plan quality for helical tomotherapy (HT), using delivery times with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT; Rapid <b>Arc</b> [RA]) as <b>reference.</b> Methods: In a previous study, double arc RA (Eclipse) and standard HT plans (TomoHD™) were created for five oropharyngeal cancer patients and reported according to ICRU 83 guidelines. By modifying the beam width from 2. 5 to 5. 0 cm, elevating the pitch and lowering the modulation factor, "TomoFast" (TF) plans were generated with treatment times equal to RA plans. To quantify the impact of TF's craniocaudal gradient, similar plans were generated on TomoEdgeTM (TomoEdgeFast;TEF). The homogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), mean dose, Dnear-max (D 2) and Dnear-min (D 98) of the PTVs were analyzed as well as the mean dose, specific critical doses and volumes of 26 organs at risk (OARs). Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: With a mean treatment time of 3. 05 min (RA), 2. 89 min (TF) and 2. 95 min (TEF), PTVtherapeutic coverage was more homogeneous with TF (HI. 07;SE. 01) and TEF (HI. 08;SE. 01) compared to RA (HI. 10;SE. 01), while PTVprophylactic was most homogeneous with RA. Mean doses to parotid glands were comparable for RA, TF, TEF: 25. 62, 25. 34, 23. 09 Gy for contralateral and 32. 02, 31. 96, 30. 01 Gy for ipsilateral glands, respectively. OARs' mean doses varied between different approaches not favoring a particular technique. TF's higher dose to OARs at the cranial-caudal edges of the PTVs and its higher integral dose, both due to the extended cranial-caudal gradient, seems to be solved by the new TomoEdge™ software. However, all these faster techniques lose part of standard TomoHD's OAR sparing capacity Conclusion: It is possible to treat oropharyngeal cancer patients using HT (TF/TEF) within time-frames observed for RA maintaining comparable target coverage and sparing of OARs. This study indicates that treatment time is not technology specific, rather an operator's decision on balancing efficiency and quality. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} ability to trap large {{magnetic}} inductions, bulk (RE) BCO materials (where RE stands for rare-earth ion) can be used as powerful permanent magnets. Previous works have shown that the magnetization of a bulk superconductor can be destroyed by the presence of an ac magnetic field applied transversally to the remnant magnetization. Up to now, the exact process of this magnetization decay is not completely understood, i. e. it is not clear if the decay is only due to a redistribution of the superconducting currents in the volume of the pellet or if a part of this decay can be due to self-heating of the material subjected to the ac excitation. In this work, we carry out, in liquid nitrogen, measurements for which the ac field is applied during several hours. We investigate the range of relatively small ac field amplitudes (in comparison to the penetration field of the pellet) and {{in a wide range of}} low frequencies (1 mHz– 20 Hz). The waveform of the parasitic ac field is either sinusoidal or triangular, the latter corresponding to a constant variation of the applied induction, dBapp/dt. The studied sample is a cylindrical bulk single grain GdBCO pellet whose dimensions are 10 mm in height and 15 mm in diameter. Thermocouples are placed on the pellet surface to probe possible self-heating of the material during the experiments. A high sensitivity cryogenic Hall probe is placed close to the surface to measure the local magnetic induction normal to the surface (and parallel to the transverse ac field). The results show first that, for a given number of applied triangular transverse cycles, lower values of dBapp/dt induce larger magnetization decays [...] An important feature of practical interest is that, after a very large number of cycles (> 10000) which cause the removal of a given amount of magnetization (depending on the amplitude and the frequency of the field), the rate of the magnetization decay goes back to its initial value, corresponding to the relaxation of the superconducting currents due to flux creep only. The thermocouples show no evidence of self-heating in that range of amplitude and frequency of the applied field.
