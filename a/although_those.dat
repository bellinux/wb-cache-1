5|$|After the 1952 season, Maryland and {{six other}} schools left the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The {{following}} year, the conference honored its inaugural season's best players with an All-ACC team. In that initial class, five Terrapins were selected to the first team and two to the second team. Since 1953, Maryland players have received first-team All-ACC honors a total of 132times. Terrapins have been named to All-ACC second or third teams an additional 61times, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> teams have not been published continuously and there currently is no third team.|$|E

The majority of matches played by Newton for the county between 1876 and 1878 are recorded by CricketArchive as being for the 'Gentlemen of Somerset', and are not categorised as first-class cricket, and <b>although</b> <b>those</b> from 1879 onwards are recorded as being for 'Somerset', they are generally regarded as remaining a 'second-class' of cricket.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with {{the rim of the}} top of the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50.

5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> {{predominant}} {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. <b>Although</b> <b>those</b> responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E

5|$|Second and third-generation {{descendants}} of Japanese-Palauans who were descended from earlier settlers generally chose to remain behind, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> who {{were raised in}} Japanese-speaking families reportedly faced trouble conversing in Palauan. Most retained their Japanese surnames, but Japanese-Paluans generally identified themselves as Palauans after the war. Second-generation Japanese-Palauans usually married Palauan women, and became assimilated with the local Palauan populace. In terms of self-identification, Japanese-Palauans usually emphasised their Japanese identities only on occasions when they associate with other Japanese, for instance when they participate in memorial services for Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Some Japanese-Palauans also chose {{to be buried in}} Japanese cemeteries after their deaths, notably those in Koror.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cathedral}} was {{designed}} by French architects, it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France. Above all, it is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone. Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland. As bricks and mortar are {{not as strong as}} stone, the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone (<b>although</b> <b>those</b> in the nave are of brick). The north transept portal is also built of limestone, no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window, also structured in limestone itself. While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design, the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics. Constructed in about 1330, the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French. Nicolaus from Västerås, the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s, appears to have slightly modified the original plans, adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin. It {{is interesting to note that}} cross-vaults were nevertheless installed, rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the time. Work on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey. The towers, however, still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture, indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time. Overall, despite minor differences, Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France.|$|E

5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E
5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, <b>although</b> <b>those</b> already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
