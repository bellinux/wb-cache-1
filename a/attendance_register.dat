40|$|This study {{looked at}} the way poor-performing public {{secondary}} schools in Gauteng Province understand school accountability; their current internal accountability instruments; the way professional development is conducted; and their engagement with the Integrated Quality Management System, the external school accountability system. The intention {{of the study was}} to identify possible instruments to mobilise bureaucratic and professional accountability in poor-performing secondary schools. The study was a case study of three poor-performing secondary schools and relied on teachers and principals at these schools to learn their understanding and reactions to the notion of accountability. The study revealed that such schools use bureaucratic instruments (such as <b>attendance</b> <b>registers)</b> to realise accountability and to create structure and routine in their schools. However, where leadership is weak, even these bureaucratic tools such as <b>attendance</b> <b>registers</b> are ineffective. These schools do not take action against non-conformance by teachers and principals. In the schools investigated, accountability was seen as ‘doing your work as you were trained to do during your pre-service training and reporting on learner performance’. The study revealed that, to move towards greater professional accountability in the school sector, a long-term approach is needed that is underscored by ongoing professional development complemented with pressure or performance management. Equally important is the need to build collective power through improving knowledge and skills and motivation for improvement amongst both teachers and school managers...|$|R

Indeed, the only young people to use the cards were those who didn't have a problem in the first place.

50|$|The movie {{begins with}} a family of 4 going in a car when they are {{suddenly}} hit by a police car. The woman dies on spot and the man is heavily injured. A police officer {{comes out of the}} car and has a look at them when the man asks for help but ignores and tells his other officers in the car to keep moving forward.KESHAV the boy in the car is also alive. He is shocked to see his family dead right in front of his eyes.Then he wakes up in a hospital and starts to search for his family members, where ge gets to know that his parents are dead but his sister is alive but has lost her legs. The movie now moves to the present where Keshav (Nikhil Siddharth) is in a forest road walking and asking for lift.Then a man on bike gives him lift after moving some distance he stops along roadside to attend the nature call and Keshav kills him on spot. Keshav now tells us about himself he is a law student who has his heart on his right side, and increase in his heart rate may result in his death. He thus can't play sports or do anything that may get his heart rate up ,so he has to do everything calmly, even a murder. A fisherman happens to be on a boat catching fish near by the river area where Keshav killed the police officer, when he sees the murdered body hanged to a tree near the river. He calls the police immediately, and they arrive and try searching for some clues, wgere they get to know that he was a police officer. Keshav is now in his college. Satyabhama (Ritu Varma) now joins the college and is in the same class as Keshav. Satyabhama is Keshav's childhood friend, but he doesn't speak a word to her.After the class, Satyabhama hears someone call out Keshav, and again has a doubt whether he was her long lost childhood friend. She goes to him and asks him, but he disagrees.The police still try finding clues, but aren't successful.The commissioner now appoints a special officer called Sharmila (Isha Koppikar) to solve this case. Keshav now sees another police officer, and remembers him from his childhood, when his sister and him were admitted in the hospital, and that police officer ordered someone to kill both of them.Keshav had then run away with his sister,but now,he follows the police officer and kills him in a stylish way.Officer Sharmila reaches the spot and sees the police officer's body hanged to a construction crane.She then concludes that the culprit of both these murders is the same,and that he is trying to communicate with them.She says so because the culprit could have hidden both the bodies easily,as the murders took place in secret areas,but the culprit chose to hang them.She studies both the bodies,and concludes that the culprit is a left hander,which actually happens to be true.In the college,Satya as well sees Keshav writing with his left hand,and is sure that he is her long lost friend,but doesn't understand why he doesn't agree.She follows him for a couple of days,and sees him reading newspapers about murders about police officers.She takes the <b>attendance</b> <b>register</b> from the person and sees that Keshava was absent on both the days the murder took place.|$|E

40|$|When {{members are}} elected or nominated, they are {{expected}} to take theirseats in the Rajya Sabha and attend its proceedings unless they are constrained to remain absent due to unavoidable reasons. Constitutional provision The Constitution provides that if for a period of sixty days a member of either House of Parliament is without permission of the House absent from all meetings thereof, the House may declare his seat vacant. 1 In computing the said period of sixty days, however, no account is taken of any period during which the House is prorogued or is adjourned for more than four consecutive days. 2 The period of sixty days referred to in the Constitution means a single unbroken period of sixty days and for invoking the provision of the Constitution, the absence has to be continuous. The period of absence is calculated from the day a member is absent from the sitting of the House till the day he next attends, whether in the same or subsequent session(s). The intervening days in session on which the House does not sit are counted but any period of prorogation or adjournment of the House for more than four consecutive days is excluded. The constitutional provision is only directory and not mandatory; being an enabling power, it is within the competence of the House to condone the absence of a member exceeding sixty days. <b>Attendance</b> <b>Register</b> In view of the specific provision that has been made in the Constitution, it has become necessary to maintain a Register of Attendance of Members.

40|$|Teaching is the act, {{practice}} and occupation of a teacher. A teacher {{is a person}} who provides education for learners at a school or other place of formal education. The use of teacher in this study is conceptualized to involve all cadres of instructors and teaching team from primary and junior secondary (basic education) to senior secondary school. The study examined the areas of job dislikes among teachers with their attendant implications for practice. Using a self-designed and pilot-tested questionnaire, data were collected from a random sample of 3, 000 teachers drawn from Lagos, Ogun, and Osun states in the Southwestern geopolitical zone of the country. Specifically, 400 primary and 600 secondary school teachers were drawn from each state. The data were analyzed using simple percentage. It was found that teachers job dislike areas though differ but were within seven areas thus: writing lesson notes (98. 5 %), marking subject <b>attendance</b> <b>register</b> (98 %), disciplining of students in school (90 %), and serving as members of committees (78. 9 %). Other dislike areas include taking students out of school for extramural activities (73. 3 %), partaking in co-curricular activities in the school (60. 3 %) and examination invigilation (59. 1 %) as areas of common dislike and capable of inhibiting the satisfaction levels of teachers. Furthermore, it was found that differences exist in job dislikes between male and female teachers. The common job dislikes among male were non-interest in marking of scripts and invigilation of examinations whereas the female showed dislikes for serving as committee members and as year tutors. Thus, it was recommended that: some modifications in the operational approaches of classroom teachers (such as deemphasizing lesson note writing and marking of subject <b>attendance</b> <b>register)</b> would be required.
