40|$|Analysis of gene {{expression}} in specific muscles of swine and turkey The meat quality {{is a result}} of properties of muscle metabolism and muscle structure <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Thus, it is a quantitative trait with a large number of genes involved. Moreover, environmental factors are modifying the gene effects at all stages of the ontogenesis. In our approach, we focussed on the expression of a set of genes with potential functions in development and growth of skeletal muscle. This set includes key regulatory factors of muscle cell development and growth as well as genes coding for major structural components of skeletal muscle. In swine, we investigated the expression of a total of 12 genes in M. biceps femoris of newborn piglets by RT-real time PCR. Aim of this investigation was the identification of genes differentially expressed between piglets suffering from a muscular disease (splay leg) and healthy controls. Differences in the expression of several Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC) isoforms were found only when the animals were assigned to groups with different degrees of pathological alterations in the ultrastructure of the muscle as revealed by electron microscopy.

The animals were divided into two groups based on sex (17 male and 17 female) and slaughter age (85 +/- 10. 14 days (Group 1) and 139 +/- 17. 55 days (Group 2)). In comparison to female kids, male kids had significantly higher average birth weight (3. 3 kg : 3. 7 kg) and significantly higher average daily gain (163 g : 203 g). Due to greater birth weight and average daily gain, male kids reached higher slaughter weight than female kids. Although mean values of dressing percentage between sexes were not significant (P > 0. 05), females (47. 1 %) had slightly higher values than male kids (45. 2 %). The increased slaughter weight accompanied the feeding period from 83 to 139 days and, although not significant (P > 0. 05), showed slight increase in dressing percentage between groups. Age had positive and significant (P <= 0. 001) influence on deposition of subcutaneous fatness. Male kids had more developed carcasses than females.

40|$|Two new genetic {{evaluations}} on carcass data, {{extracted from}} the Normabev database, have been developed by the UMT 3 G (Gestion Génétique et Génomique des populations bovines). The first (VB) is a multibreed evaluation of sires {{on their ability to}} produce veal calves. It evaluates sires of dual-purpose breeds Montbeliarde (MON) or Normande (NOR) and sires of beef breeds mated with dairy cows. The second (JB) evaluates sires of the MON, NOR and Simmental (SIM) breeds on their ability to produce young bulls for slaughter. The JB evaluation considers three traits simultaneously (carcass weight, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> and carcass conformation), the VB four (the same three, plus meat color). Heritability estimates are moderate to quite high for carcass weight and conformation (0. 12 to 0. 37, depending on the breed and the evaluation), lower for <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> and meat color (0. 05 to 0. 27). Genetic correlations between carcass weight and conformation and between carcass weight and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> are favorable. Genetic correlations between JB traits on one hand and VB, milk production and female type traits on the other hand were also estimated. These correlations are low to moderate (favorable) between JB and milk production. Hence, meat production traits can be improved without compromising genetic trends on milk production traits too much. JB traits are favorably correlated with VB (0. 32 to 0. 70) and female type traits. VB polygenic evaluations became official in 2015. JB polygenic evaluations will be official in 2017.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the effect of}} slaughtering age on horse carcass traits and on meat quality. Eighteen male Italian heavy draught horse (IHDH) breed foals were employed in the study. Soon after foaling they were randomly subdivided in 3 groups according to 3 <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughtering</b> classes: 6 months old, 11 months old and 18 months old. Live weight, hot carcass weight and dressing percentage of each animal were recorded. After slaughtering, meat samples were collected from Longissimus Dorsi muscle between 13 th and 18 th thoracic vertebra of each animal and then analyzed. The right half carcass of each animal was then divided in cuts. Each one was subdivided into lean, fat and bones. Then, the classification of the lean meat in first and second quality cuts was performed according to the butchers’ customs. Older animals were characterized by a lower incidence of first quality cuts (p< 0. 01) on carcass. Younger animals showed greater content in protein (p< 0. 01). Fatty acid profile showed an increasing trend of PUFA connected to the increasing of slaughtering age (p< 0. 05). The unsaturation index of intramuscular fatty acids was not affected by slaughtering age, confirming that horse meat, if compared to beef, is more suitable from a nutritional point of view.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the effect of grazing on meat quality of young Pod- olian bulls by using 6 free-ranging (FR) and 6 {{confined}} (CON) animals slaughtered at 18 mo of age (Exp. 1). A second experiment (Exp. 2) was performed the subse- quent year where the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> was 15 mo of age (6 animals/group). Quantitative descriptive sensory analy- sis, water-holding capacity (WHC; thawing, centrifuga- tion, and cooking losses), and shear force (only in Exp. 2) were evaluated on LM, aged 8 d. Both experiments showed that CON animals produced beef with greater overall beef flavor (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05 in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively) and odor intensities (P < 0. 10 and P < 0. 05 in Exp. and 1 and 2, respectively) and increased malo- ndialdehyde contents (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05 in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively). In Exp. 2 beef from FR bulls showed higher sensory tenderness as compared with CON bulls (P < 0. 05) and a lower shear force (P < 0. 05). In Exp. 1, beef obtained from FR bulls showed lower centrifugation and greater thawing losses compared with samples from bulls from group CON (P < 0. 05) whereas rearing system did not affect any WHC variables in Exp. 2. The results obtained from the 2 experiments were generally consis- tent. The different results occasionally observed (e. g., sensory tenderness and WHC) is attributed to the differ- ent ages at slaughter used in the 2 experiments (18 and 15 mo). In particular, at an earlier <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> (15 mo) the effect of FR on meat quality was beneficial on sensory tenderness and mechanical properties. Therefore, given the additional costs of maintaining the bulls for another 3 mo when slaughtered at 18 mo of age, a reduced <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> of FR bulls may be suggested to avoid the decrement of herbage mass availability inducing the con- sumption of high amounts of concentrate...|$|E

40|$|The {{fat content}} and fatty acid {{composition}} of porcine meat and carcass influence nutritional value {{of meat and}} various techno- logical aspects of meat and carcass quality. Variation in lipid composition has an important effect on firmness of the fat in meat, especially the subcutaneous and intermuscular (carcass fats) but also the intramuscular (marbling) fat. Moreover, as {{a major source of}} energy and as structural components of mem- branes, fatty acids are essential for life. The aim {{of the study was to}} estimate genetic parameters for backfat fatty acid composition (FAC) and intramuscular fat content (IMF) of semimembranosus muscle in a sample of 949 Sib-tested Italian Large White pigs. Backfat tissue and semimembranosus muscle tissue samples were collected <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> and stored <b>at</b> - 80 °C. IMF content and backfat FAC were determined by gas chromatography and analy- sis of the fatty acid methyl esters. Heritability (h 2) and genetic correlations between subcutaneous fatty acids composition and carcass and meat quality traits were estimated using the restrict- ed maximum likelihood methodology applied to a multiple-trait Animal Model. The model was: Yijklm = μ + sexi + dj + b 1 ak + animall + eijklm where Y = analysed traits; μ = general mean; sex = fixed effect of sex; d = fixed effect of slaugher day; b 1 = regression coefficient of the fixed effect of <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughtering</b> (ak); animal = random additive effect of each animal; eijklm = error of the model. Results showed that the estimate of h 2 for FAC were of moderate magnitude. This study suggest that back- fat FAC is genetically correlated with carcass quality traits and the selection for carcass and meat quality traits produces a cor- related response on FAC of subcutaneous fat. The reduction in fat covering tissue is associated with an increase of lipid insatu- ration and a decrease in subcutaneous fat firmness that deter- mines technological problems in dry cured ham quality. Very low genetic correlations were found between IMF content and back- fat fatty acids. The results found suggest the possibility of genet- ic improvement of FAC of subcutaneous fat by a partial substitu- tion of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated ones.

Meat of female rabbits contains more intramuscular fat and cholesterol compared to the male ones (5. 7 vs. 5. 2 g of intramuscular fat/ 100 g; p 0. 05; 71. 5 vs. 63. 7 mg of cholesterol/ 100 g, respectively; p 0. 01). Genotype line does not affect either the fatty acid profile or the content of cholesterol, but it has a significant impact on intramuscular fat (A line 5. 0 g/ 100 g; AC line 5. 9 g/ 100 g; C line 5. 4 g/ 100 g; p 0. 05) as well as on cutting values across the fibres (Instron apparatus; A line 43 N; AC line 38 N; C line 42 N; p 0. 05). Meat of 105 -day-old rabbits contains more intramuscular fat (5. 7 vs. 5. 2 g/ 100 g; respectively; p 0. 05) and shows darker and redder colour (both sensorially evaluated colour as well as instrumentally measured L* and a* values; p 0. 01) compared to the 93 -day-old ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of consumers refuse meat {{with higher levels}} of fat, because of possible association between high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease. The meat production tries to fit consumers preferences with lowering fat content of meat. Such meat should also contain less cholesterol. In the following contribution the possibilities for reducing fat and cholesterol content and altering fatty acid composition of meat are discussed. In meat animals the estimated heritability for fat content is relatively high (between 0. 3 and 0. 6). This means that selection represents a powerful tool for fat reduction. Even better possibility for reducing fat and altering fatty acid composition is adequate nutrition. The decrease of animal <b>age</b> and weight <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> can also reduce carcass fat content. Also the use of transgenic animals and different growth stimulators represents a wide range of possibilities to reduce fat content in farm animals. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{risk assessment}} model investigating the risk of human infection with campylobacter from the consumption of chicken meat/products is currently being formulated. Here such an approach is {{used to evaluate the}} probability that a random bird, selected <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> from Great Britain's national poultry flock, will be campylobacter-positive.

40|$|Fattening of steers for beef {{production}} is rather {{rare in the}} Czech Republic therefore {{it has not been}} subjected to research to a large extent. Tyleček (1957) analysed the effect of age of Czech Pied bulls at castration on their feedlot perform-ance. He found daily weight gain 881 g in early cas-trated (at 35 days of age) animals and 952 g in late castrated animals (at 437 days of age); the weight and proportion of kidney fat 7. 5 kg and 1. 84 % compare to 6. 72 kg and 1. 51 % and live weight at slaughter 460. 75 kg compares to 498. 75 kg in the two respective groups. As for the meat quality of the early and late castrated animals, proportion of fat in muscle was 1. 72 % and 1. 13 %, respectively and dry matter in muscle 26. 12 % and 25. 30 %, respectively in the two observed groups. Braun and Lízal (1970) studied the fattening of loose housed steers and presented these results: <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> 565. 2 days, live weight at slaughter 360. 2 kg, weight of kidney fat 3. 8 kg, dressing percentage 56. 2 %, fat content in muscle 2. 21 % with dry matter 26. 05 %. A major part of recent research in this field was carried out by Chládek and Ingr (2003), who analysed feedlot performance and meat quality of Holstein steers fattened up to 400 – 500 kg. Some of the results of analyses were as follows: weight at slaughter 435. 8 kg, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> 417. 5 days, dai-ly weight gain 1 089 kg, net weight gain 0. 566 kg, dressing percentage 51. 4 %, weight and proportion of kidney fat 5. 05 kg and 2. 27 %, weight and pro-portion of fat trim 3. 93 kg and 3. 52 %, dry matter and fat content in muscle 25. 0 % and 1. 92 %, col-lagen content in muscle 1. 16 %, pH 24 5. 51, drip loss 1. 07 % and remission (525 nm) 7. 76 %. e authors concluded that carcass traits were most of all affected by live weight and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> and total weight gain; the effect of daily weight gain and duration of fattening was less significant.

40|$|The {{profitability}} of dual-purpose breeding farms {{can be increased}} through genetic improvement of carcass traits. To develop a genetic evaluation of carcass traits of young bulls, breed-specific genetic parameters were estimated in three French dual-purpose breeds. Genetic correlations between these traits and veal calf, type and milk production traits were also estimated. Slaughter performances of 156 226 Montbeliarde, 160 361 Normande and 8691 Simmental young bulls were analyzed with a multitrait animal model. In the three breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight (0. 12 to 0. 19 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 04) and carcass conformation (0. 21 to 0. 26 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 04) and slightly lower for <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> (0. 08 to 0. 17 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 03). For all three breeds, genetic correlations between carcass weight and carcass conformation were moderate and favorable (0. 30 to 0. 52 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 13). They were strong and favorable (- 0. 49 to - 0. 71 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 15) between carcass weight and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Between <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> and carcass conformation, they were low and unfavorable to moderate and favorable (- 0. 25 to 0. 10 +/- 0. 06 to 0. 18). Heavier young bulls tend to be better conformed and slaughtered earlier. Genetic correlations between corresponding young bulls and veal production traits were moderate and favorable (0. 32 to 0. 70 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 09), implying that selecting sires for veal calf production leads to select sires producing better young bulls. Genetic correlations between young bull carcass weight and cow size were moderately favorable (0. 22 to 0. 45 +/- 0. 04 to 0. 10). Young bull carcass conformation had moderate and favorable genetic correlations (0. 11 to 0. 24 +/- 0. 04 to 0. 10) with cow width but moderate and unfavorable genetic correlations (- 0. 21 to - 0. 36 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 08) with cow height. Taller cows tended to produce heavier young bulls and thinner cows to produce less conformed ones. Genetic correlations between carcass traits of young bulls and cow muscularity traits were low to moderate and favorable. Finally, genetic correlations between carcass traits of young bulls and milk production traits were low and unfavorable to moderate and favorable. These results indicate the existence for all three breeds of genetic variability for the genetic improvement of carcass traits of young bulls as well as favorable genetic correlations for their simultaneous selection and no strong unfavorable correlation with milk production traits...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} production, ascarid burden and {{respiratory}} disease were measured on 15 purposively selected swine herds, and {{the relationships between}} the various measures of ascarid burden were examined. On each farm 30 randomly selected pigs were weighed and rectal fecal samples were collected at approximately 11, 15, 19 and 22 weeks of <b>age,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Fecal ascarid-egg counts and duration of infection were combined to calculate a composite measure of ascarid burden called "lifetime burden". At the abattoir the carcass weight and levels of anteroventral pneumonia, atrophic rhinitis, and liver lesions were recorded for each hog. The number of ascarids in the small intestines were counted. Study hogs were marketed at an average of 189 +/- 22 days. The average dressed carcass weight was 77. 0 +/- 5. 9 kg and the mean average daily gain was 0. 519 +/- 0. 071 kg/day. The percent of hogs with ascariasis varied widely among farms, no matter what measure of ascariasis was used; the percent with intestinal ascarids <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> ranged from 0 % to 96 %, the percent that shed ascarid eggs during their lifetime ranged from 0 % to 100 %, and the range for hogs with liver lesions ranged from 27 % to 100 %. Of the hogs slaughtered, 82 % had milk spot lesions, 32 % shed ascarid eggs during their lifetime and 35 % had intestinal ascarids. The latter had an average of 12 intestinal ascarids. Anteroventral pneumonia occurred in 55 % of the slaughtered hogs and 9 % had atrophic rhinitis scores of five. The percent of hogs per farm with pneumonia ranged from 17 % to 96 %. The percent of hogs per farm with atrophic rhinitis scores of five ranged from 0 % to 57 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the ecology of Salmonella {{infection}} in pigs in bed-ding production systems (500 - 1000 pigs in one large pen, bedded on straw and/or rice hulls) with that in pigs in traditional (10 - 20 pigs per pen, concrete floor) systems. Eight Salmonella sero-positive study herds were selected to give 4 different combinations of weaner/grow-finisher and deep litter/concrete-based production systems. Individually identified pigs were bled at 9 - 10 and 16 weeks of <b>age</b> and <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> (22 - 24 weeks) to estimate seroprevalence. At each bleed pen faecal samples were collected to identify the serotypes present. Two batches of pigs from each herd were studied. There were substantial differences in the infection patterns over time within both high and low prevalence herds as found overseas. This appeared to be unrelated to the use of bedding production systems at either the weaner or grower/finisher stage. Feed serovars may play a larger role in Australia than previously thought. Introduction In Australia, increasing numbers of pigs are housed on bedding (straw or rice hulls) instead of concrete (partial or full slats). These deep litter sheds containing up to 1000 pigs in a sin-gle enclosure, have a number of advantages, with the result that they have become the most com-monly built pig facility in this country...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{prevalence}} of antibiotic resistance and of different resistance patterns for Salmonella isolates collected from sows, from fattening pigs <b>at</b> different <b>ages</b> and <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> was determined. All 901 isolates were submitted to {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} for 14 com-pounds using the disk agar diffusion test. Overall, 50. 9 % of the strains were resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent. The highest per-centage of resistance was found to oxytetracycline (34. 2 %), streptomycin (32. 5 %), sulphamethi-zole (27. 6 %) and ampicillin (24. 9 %). Multiresistance (resistance$ 2 antimicrobials) was observed in 33. 2 % of the strains. A significant lower proportion (p< 0. 01) of resistant strains was recovered in faecal samples from sows than from fattening pigs during the weaning, growing and finishing peri-od. When designing antimicrobial resistance surveillance programmes for Salmonella in pigs, {{it is important to}} take multiple samples within each herd from fattening pigs at different time points. Introduction The major sources for human salmonellosis, one of the most occurring foodborne infections, are eggs, poultry meat and pork. In Belgium, 11. 065, 10. 075 and 12. 894 human cases were reported in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively (NRSS, 2003). Further identification revealed that each year, S.
