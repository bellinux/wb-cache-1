5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown <b>and</b> <b>Marc</b> Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Bruichladdich Radical {{remained}} in the Le Mans Series in 2008, but had an all-new driver line-up of Jens Petersen, Jan-Dirk Leuders <b>and</b> <b>Marc</b> Rostan. The season opener, which was the 1000 km of Catalunya, saw the team finish 15th overall, and seventh in class. However, {{the rest of the}} season was unsuccessful, as the team did not finish above 30th overall in any of the remaining LMS races, or the 24 Hours of Le Mans; although 30th at the 1000km of Spa equated to seventh in class, due to attrition. As a result, the team slipped to joint-eleventh in class, with four points.|$|E
