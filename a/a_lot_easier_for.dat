This helps explain why we can’t overgeneralize about what works in respect of models of service designed to prevent or respond to homelessness. This said there are some key messages from the totality of evidence that has been accumulated to date. First homelessness would be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to prevent <b>for</b> first or subsequent episodes if adequate and appropriate (developmentally/ culturally) housing was available.

500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really care if I get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long as I get picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes it <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E

This guideline presents key issues related to delivering learning support materials through a VLE, based on perspectives of disabled students and academic staff. Pedagogical, practical and strategic implications have been identified and set in context within discussion and action points to encourage extended reflection on individual, departmental and institutional practice. Learning support materials The term learning support materials refers to the online delivery of Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDF, web resources, multimedia {{and other forms of}} documentation in support of face-to-face sessions. When learning support materials are delivered through a VLE, students benefit from having a central location for all resources as well as access to digital materials in a variety of flexible formats which {{can be adapted}} to suit their individual needs. Remote access to learning support materials means that students also have the ability to engage with materials at a time and place convenient to them, as they are not reliant on contact hours alone. “If I knew I could print it off later and could concentrate on what they were saying or if I had it {{in front of me and}} could annotate it …then it would be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier,</b> and that's <b>for</b> everyone, not just for people with learning difficulties. ...|$|R

Having {{taken part in}} most of the games in Birmingham's League Cup run, he was omitted from the first leg of the semi-final at Ipswich Town in favour of loan player Steve Jenkins.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we simplify and {{otherwise}} improve the local resolution of singularities algorithm of [G 1]-[G 3], providing a local resolution of singularities method {{that works for}} functions with convergent power series over an arbitrary local field of characteristic zero. The algorithm {{of this paper is}} an entirely elementary classical analysis argument, using only the implicit function theorem and elementary facts about power series and Newton polyhedra. Several examples are given. The methods are quite different from traditional resolution of singularities methods. In a separate paper arxiv: 1104. 4684, the methods of this paper (but for the most part not the resolution of singularities theorems themselves) are used to prove results concerning oscillatory integrals, exponential sums, and related matters. Note: This paper should be viewed as a replacement for the resolution of singularities portion of older versions of arxiv: 1104. 4684, as this paper is quite a bit different from that algorithm, and should be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to read. <b>For</b> one, standard blowups are used here, rather than the monomial maps of arxiv: 1104. 4684 which forced one to deal with technical issues related to such monomial maps not necessarily being one to one. Secondly, the complicated iterated domain subdivisions using Newton polyhedra that were done in arxiv: 1104. 4684 have been reduced to a short one-stage argument, given in section 2. Thirdly, forming partitions of unity can be done more naturally {{in the context of the}} newer algorithm (see Lemma 3. 5).

40|$|Several French {{cities are}} now {{developing}} and building Light Rail-systems (LR) from scratch, that is LR has been absent for several decades. In France LR and {{urban public transport}} in general are very strongly connected to the city in a broad sense, to city politics and politicians, urban environment matters and urban planning. This seems to make rapid implementation of LR-projects <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier,</b> in Lyon <b>for</b> example the two new lines were built in fours years. The proportion of urban regeneration costs of the total LR infrastructure investments is about half. Financing of LR has hitherto been exclusively public, private financing is discussed (as in Sweden) but there are at present no such schemes. The French urban transport legislation, {{for which there is}} probably no equivalent in other countries, demands a reduction of urban car traffic. This is a political objective and LR-development {{has become one of the}} means of achieving it. Like France and Sweden, England was for the most part without light rail for about 40 years. Most of the urban tramway systems were abandoned in favour of the bus in the 1950 's, and street running light rail was not seen again until the early 1990 's (in Manchester). In England the new light rail projects serve urban regions and sub-regions. This distinguishes them from the French schemes, which mostly tend to serve areas within the city itself. Beyond the city boundary, public transport tends to be less satisfactory, and may suffer from resources being focused on "showcase" light rail projects within the city itself. Perhaps this reveals a difference of urban culture and structure, in that English suburbs are usually of higher social status and quality than their French counterparts. In both countries LR is seen as a way of providing more priority for public transport, given the perceived difficulties of enforcing priorities for buses. However, LR development is not linked to traffic reduction policies in English cities...|$|R
