5|$|Historically, {{elephants}} {{were considered}} formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour {{to protect their}} sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier {{to the ground and}} impale him.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
5|$|The duo {{tries to}} make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, {{thinking}} Woody eliminated RC as well, attack <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy.|$|E

25|$|After the Dhuni fire is lit and prayers, bhajans, and devotional {{songs are}} sung, people line {{up and take}} a piece of {{sandalwood}}. In turn they dip the sandalwood stick into ghee (clarified butter) <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> it into the fire, intending the offering to represent the relinquishing of some attachment or psychological limitation that they wish to be consumed by the fire. The ritual thus symbolizes surrendering and giving up desires and limitations to God.|$|E
25|$|Traces of {{the older}} Günz and Mindel {{glaciation}} are only left in a few places, because most has been removed or transferred by the later glaciations. The greatest extension was reached by the glaciers of the Riss glaciation, when the entire Swiss Plateau was covered with ice except for the Napf <b>and</b> <b>Töss</b> regions. Most notable are the traces of the Würm glaciation about 15000 years ago. The end moraines of different glacial retreats have been conserved.|$|E

25|$|Except for Brophy, all {{crew members}} of the Lancaster managed to escape the burning bomber. Five left through the front escape hatch {{on the floor of}} the cockpit. When bomb aimer Jack Friday, tried to release the escape hatch cover in the aircraft's nose, the rushing wind ripped it from his hands. The hatch cover caught him above his left eye and knocked him out. He fell into the open hatch and jammed it closed until Flight {{engineer}} Roy Vigars reached him to quickly clip on Friday's parachute <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> him out the hatch while pulling the unconscious crewman's rip cord. Only Mynarski managed to leave via the rear escape door.|$|E
25|$|Egil {{lived to}} be an old age. Arinbjörn became a close advisor to Harald Eiríksson, to whom Egill {{composed}} a poem. Egil's son Bodvar (Böðvar) died in a shipwreck. Egil composed a poem in his honor. Egil's son Thorsteinn has many feuds with Steinar, son of Onund Sjoni (Önundr sjóni Anason), over land and cattle grazing. Egil became frail and blind. His one last wish was to travel to the Althing <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> silver he received from King Æthelstan for the people to fight over. Since no one was able to accompany him, he wandered alone and allegedly concealed his silver treasure near Mosfellsbær, giving birth to the legend of silfur Egils ("Egill's Silver").|$|E
25|$|Kappa are {{not entirely}} {{antagonistic}} to human beings. They are curious about human civilization, and they can understand and speak Japanese. They may even befriend human beings in exchange for gifts or offerings of nasu (茄子, Japanese eggplant), soba (そば or 蕎麦, buckwheat noodles), nattō (なっとう or 納豆, fermented soybeans), or kabocha (カボチャ, 南瓜, winter squash), but especially cucumbers, the only food kappa are known to enjoy more than human children. Japanese parents sometimes write {{the names of their}} children, or their own names, on cucumbers <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> them into waters believed to be infested with kappa in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to bathe. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack. There is a cucumber-filled sushi roll known as kappamaki.|$|E

25|$|While Henry sulks at the Bethesda {{fountain}} with Violet, Gold takes Regina to {{find someone}} who he claims still has magic. Emma reminds Henry of their time in New York, telling him that he can still wish away his problems <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> a coin into the fountain; she reflects on the irony of her own words as she had wished to fill the void she felt in their family, which lead to Hook showing up with the memory potion. Elsewhere, Gold leads Regina into a shop, where they meet The Dragon (who survived Tamara's attack on him). Though he refuses to help someone evil as Gold, the Dragon agrees to help Regina, who is fighting her dark side. Emma, Henry, Violet, Gold and Regina watch the Dragon create a small view of where their family is; however, the Dragon fails to open a portal as his magic is not enough. He tells them that despite being called the Land Without Magic, it does exist in the Real World; however, it has become harder to tap into because of neglect.|$|E

Kariya has {{maintained}} a close friendship with Teemu Selänne, and even attended Selänne's final regular season game at the Honda Center in 2014. Despite Kariya having only once attended the arena following his retirement, Selänne made sure to invite his old teammate as [...] "he has {{meant so much to}} me, all my best years and the chemistry I’ve had with him." [...] Selänne even went so far to threaten to tie him up <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> him in his trunk of his car, then drive him to the stadium himself if Kariya refused. Paul Kariya was shown on the Jumbotron during the third period.|$|E
500|$|In her Street Fighter V incarnation, Ibuki's playstyle is {{different}} than in Street Fighter IV, becoming a [...] "resource-heavy" [...] character. She has gained new special moves such as to dodge-teleport, glide, and throw bombs with different fuses, making her even more distracting and unpredicatble. According to Capcom, [...] "Ibuki {{has always been a}} very mobile character with various target combos, but she now has even more ways to mix-up the opponent with the ability to glide through the air <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> out ninja bombs, making it very difficult to predict where she will land and where her next attack will come from. Kunais have also been a cornerstone of her playstyle, but now players will have to be much more strategic in their use as she can only stock five at a time before she has to quickly obtain another set." ...|$|E

500|$|Each court {{consists}} {{of one or}} more saucer-shaped depressions or [...] "bowls" [...] dug in the ground by the male, up to [...] deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The kakapo is {{one of only a handful}} of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound - the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males' booming mating calls. Each male's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend [...] along a ridge or [...] in diameter around a hilltop. Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> them away.|$|E
500|$|During {{the morning}} hours of June 6, two strong tornadoes caused damage {{throughout}} Wadena and Hubbard counties in Minnesota. The first tornado, rated EF2on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, touched down south of Stocking Lake and downed several trees onto cabins, vehicles and storage sheds. It also toppled an irrigation system in a field north of the lake. The tornado moved {{to the north and}} expanded to its maximum width of [...] and reached estimated peak winds of [...] Eight turkey barns were destroyed, killing an estimated 15to 20thousand turkeys. The tornado swept a home north of the area in Hubbard County off its foundation, as well as causing damage to several homes along with hundreds of acres of forest. One man working at a turkey barn was injured. The storm then produced an EF3tornado, which eventually grew to a width of [...] and reached wind speeds of [...] At Pickerel Lake, it nearly flattened every tree in the area, while destroying a trailer home, a camper, a garage and a house. At northern sections of Pickerel Lake, one home had its roof torn off and numerous trees were snapped onto other residences and farm buildings. The tornado began to lose its intensity but continued to topple trees, damage storage structures <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> debris before dissipating in Emmaville.|$|E

2500|$|During the parade, {{members of}} Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla {{and dozens of}} other krewes throw beads, coins, and other {{souvenir}} trinkets to the throngs along the parade route. In the past, members of YMKG would also fire [...]38 six-shooters loaded with blanks into the air <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> the empty shells into the crowd. This tradition was restricted in 1992 and ended entirely several years later. However, trained members of YMKG still fire loud mini-cannons mounted atop several of their parade floats.

He invented (or at least, used to tell very often) the story of the little cat: [...] "A little cat arrives where a few big dogs are eating in a pot.
