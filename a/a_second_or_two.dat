25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E

2500|$|The catcher {{can help}} his pitcher get more strike {{calls from the}} umpire by using a {{technique}} called [...] "framing".

When framing, a catcher will also hold his mitt still for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> so that the umpire has an opportunity to thoroughly consider his call (and, hopefully, let his innate biases influence his decision in a direction favorable to the catcher's team).|$|E

40|$|Hundreds of new {{search engines}} have {{recently}} {{appeared on the}} Web. Many of them consist of a search front-end that accesses one or more search back-ends through a Web API. Typical API latencies range from one tenth of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> to one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>seconds.</b> Such latencies are acceptable for run-ning a single query, but make it impractical to compute a co-operative response, which requires running many subqueries, using the sequential algorithms that have been proposed so in the literature for that purpose. The front-end, however, can compute a cooperative response by exploiting the in-herent parallelism of a Web API. We describe a parallel al-gorithm that computes cooperative responses and prove its soundness, completeness and non-redundancy.

40|$|Educated humans use {{language}} to express abstract number, applying {{the same number}} words to seven apples, whistles, or sins. Is language or education the source of numerical abstraction? Claims to the contrary must present evidence for numerical knowledge that applies to disparate entities, in people who have received no formal mathematics instruction and cannot express such knowledge in words. Here we show that preschool children can compare and add large sets of elements without counting, both within a single visual-spatial modality (arrays of dots) and across two modalities and formats (dot arrays and tone sequences). In two experiments, children viewed animations and either compared one visible array of dots to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> array <b>or</b> added <b>two</b> successive dot arrays and compared the sum to a third array. In further experiments, a dot array {{was replaced by a}} sequence of sounds, so that participants had to integrate quantity information presented aurally and visually. Children performed all tasks successfully, without resorting to guessing strategies or responding to continuous variables. Their accuracy varied with the ratio of the two quantities: a signature of large, approximate number representations in adult humans and animals. Addition was as accurate as comparison, even though children showed no relevant knowledge when presented with symbolic versions of the addition tasks. Abstract knowledge of number and addition therefore precedes, and may guide, language-based instruction in mathematics...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{catalytic}} oxidation (SCO) of ammonia to a nitrogen molecule {{is an important}} process involved in many applications such as removing NH(3) slip in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO(x), reducing the NH(3) concentration from biomass-derived fuels, etc. Here we perform density functional theory calculations in conjunction with cluster models to investigate the SCO mechanisms on V(2) O(5) surfaces. Our calculations show that, at the initial stage, NH(3) can be activated by transferring an electron to the metal oxide surfaces, giving rise to an NH(3) (+) intermediate. We disclose that the subsequent pathways are strongly dependent {{on the availability of}} the gaseous species. When oxygen is limited or absent, N(2) H(4) can be produced from NH(3) (+) reacting with <b>a</b> <b>second</b> NH(3) <b>or</b> from <b>two</b> activated intermediates (e. g., NH(2) + NH(2) or ONH(2) + NH(2)), and oxidation of N(2) H(4) into N(2) by V=O is viable. On the other hand, when oxygen is abundant, NH(3) (+) will react with O(2) to make a NH(3) (+) center dot center dot center dot O(2) complex. Such a species will quiddy decompose into NO, which switches on the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reaction, eventually leading to the formation of N(2). We propose that the combination of an efficient Ostwald reaction catalyst for NH(3) to NO transformation with a capable SCR reaction catalyst for NO reduction by NH(3) to N(2) can lead to a good candidate catalyst for SCO at the high O(2) /NH(3) ratio condition.

Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror.

[...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E
