5000|$|With his fashion {{business}} soaring, Walker {{was finally}} able to fulfill his childhood dream of buying a Porsche when he bought a 1974 Porsche 911 in 1992. He started to collect more and more cars and joined the Porsche Club of America in 2002, to find a more suitable outlet for his love for speed, which resulted in various speeding tickets. He started participating in race events after obtaining a clubsport license and began so involved in racing that he lost all fun in the sport. Consequently, he sold all cars of his that weren't Porsches and instead focused his efforts on completing his collection of vintage 911s. At a later point, he sold some of his over 40 Porsches and now holds a customized collection of 25 cars worth approximatley $7,5 million, which are not for sale. He however sells, merchandise and offers customization services under his own imprint, Urban Outlaw. Having a background in fashion design, he did not conform to the unwritten rules of vintage car restoration and strived to turn every car he owned into a unique piece of art without comprimising its Porsche roots. Due to this and his edgy <b>appearence</b> unusual for a Porsche enthusiast , his initially strictly private car collection soon attracted public attention. In 2012, Walker was approached by advertisement director Tamir Moscovici, who intended to film a documentary about him and his car collection. The resulting short film, Urban Outlaw, was shown at the 2013 Sundance Festival to [...] "rave reviews" [...] and suddently turned Walker into a public phenomenon for the custom car scene and he was featured in mutiple automobile magazines and invited to events. His newfound fame led to Porsche, 35 after he wrote a letter of application as a child, to reach out to him. He has since featured in several Porsche adverts and acts as a spokesperson for the brand. Furthermore, he appeared in several other documentaries, such as I am Steve McQueen (2014) and Motor City Outlaw (2016) and TV shows, such as How I Rock It (2013), The Joe Rogan Experience (2015), and Jay Leno's Garage (2017), mostly centering on his role as a Porsche collector and customizer. In 2015, he was featured in the video game Need for Speed, as one of the icons the player character and his crew seek to impress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates a convex {{relaxation}} approach for minimum description length (MDL) based image partitioning or labeling, which proposes an energy functional regularized by the spatial smooth-ness prior joint with a penalty {{for the total}} number of <b>appearences</b> or labels, the so-called label cost prior. As common in recent studies of con-vex {{relaxation approach}}es, the total-variation term is applied to encode the spatial regularity of partition boundaries and the auxiliary label cost term is penalized by the sum of convex infinity norms of the labeling functions. We study the proposed such convex MDL based image par-tition model under a novel continuous flow maximization perspective, where we show that the label cost prior amounts to a relaxation of the flow conservation condition which is crucial to study the classical du-ality of max-flow and min-cut! To the best of our knowledge, it is new to demonstrate such connections between the relaxation of flow conser-vation and the penalty of {{the total number of}} active <b>appearences.</b> In addition, we show that the proposed continuous max-flow formulation also leads to a fast and reliable max-flow based algorithm to address the challenging convex optimization problem, which significantly out-performs the previous approach by direct convex programming, in terms of speed, computation load and handling large-scale images. Its numeri-cal scheme can by easily implemented and accelerated by the advanced computation framework, e. g. GPU. ...|$|R

The aim {{of this research is}} to easier identifying the victims of electrical injury with muscle as the sampel. Method: 30 wistar rats were divided into 5 groups through simple random sampling. Group 1 - 4 received electric current through direct contact. Group 1 and 4 received (P 1) 1 - 30 mA, (P 2) 31 - 60 mA, (P 2) 61 - 90 mA, and (P 3) 91 - 120 mA of electric current respectively. Group 5 (P 5) was received no treatment. Mice were then decapitated in order to assess the amount of hypercontraction on gastrocnemius muscle. Statistical analysis was conducted by indepedent sampel test. Result: Mean score hypercontraction gastrocnemius muscle significant (p< 0, 05). Mean score hypercontraction group P 1 smallest, that is 110, 2 ± 55, 45. Mean score hipercontraction group P 4 largest, that is 374, 7 ± 120, 03. There was significant differences histopatologic <b>appearences</b> of the gastrocnemius muscle point of contact electrical with homolateral part of gastrocnemius muscle’s Wistar mice between group PI (0, 025), P 4 (0, 017).

In spite of physical interpretation of these objects as analogs of the scattering data, the generalizations are not clear, or may even be absent. This problem has an independent interest. For example, the well known Novikov’s equations, appearing in a general theory of finite-gap integration, are (to all <b>appearences)</b> completely integrable finite-dimensional dynamical systems. A reduction of the DE to the Jacobi inverse problem demonstates the Liouville’s integrability of these equations.

40|$|Abstract: In 2003, a {{discussion}} about literacy in informatics was initiated in Germany. Its aim was to coin the literacy concept {{in the sense of}} OECD-PISA for the domain of informatics or computer science. To illustrate the intended concept, a few sample test items were published along with an explanation of which competencies they ask for. This proved to be a very fruitful approach towards stimulating the discussion in teacher training seminars. With the experience of these discussions and further test items in mind, this article endeavours to strengthen the underlying theory of literacy in informatics.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for 3 D building extraction from aerial images for various applications such astown planning, environmental- and property-related studies. Aerial images usually reveal on one hand {{a certain amount of}} information not relevant for the given task of building extraction like vegetation, cars etc. On the other hand there is a loss of relevant information due to occlusions, low contrasts or disadvantageous perspectives. Therefore a promising concept for automated building reconstruction must incorporate a suffciantly complete model of the objects of interest. We propose a model-based approach to 3 D building extraction from aerial images which reveals a tight coupling between a generic 3 D object model and an explicit 2 D image model. The generic object model employes domain specific volumetric primitives (i. e. building part models) and combination schemes. To cover the gap between 3 D object models and 2 D image data the image model is employed to predict the projective building <b>appearences</b> in aerial images.

The basic idea is to identify some unique features in the face image of a person, extract that feature and compare.
