5000|$|Lobbying at the 1995 Basel conference by LDCs, Greenpeace {{and several}} European {{countries}} such as Denmark, led {{to the adoption of}} an amendment to the convention in 1995 termed the Basel Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention. The amendment has been accepted by 86 countries and the European Union, but has not entered into force (as that requires ratification by 3/4 of the member states to the Convention). The Amendment prohibits the export of hazardous waste from a list of developed (mostly OECD) countries to developing countries. The Basel Ban applies to export for any reason, including recycling. An area of special concern for advocates of the Amendment was the sale of ships for salvage, shipbreaking. The Ban Amendment was strenuously opposed by a number of industry groups as well as nations including Australia and Canada. The number of ratification for the entry-into force of the Ban Amendment is under debate: <b>Amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> enter into force after ratification of [...] "three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them" [...] 17.5; so far, the Parties of the Basel Convention could not yet agree whether this would be three fourth of the Parties that were Party to the Basel Convention when the Ban was adopted, or three fourth of the current Parties of the ConventionReport of COP 9 of the Basel Convention. The status of the amendment ratifications {{can be found on the}} Basel Secretariat's web page. The European Union fully implemented the Basel Ban in its Waste Shipment Regulation (EWSR), making it legally binding in all EU member states.

Member states are required <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> procedure of gradual implementation of the new provisions by 31 December 2016, with all seafarers being required to obtain certificates issued in accordance with the amended regulations by 1 January 2017. Although ship navigation during sailing has been significantly facilitated by the development of technics and technology, seafarers are now required to be well-versed in an increasing number of maritime law regulations and procedures promoting the safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment, while simultaneously ensuring unobstructed exploitation of ships. <b>The</b> latest <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> STCW <b>Convention</b> in this sense, in Model Course 7. 01., impose additional seafarer training requirements, inter alia, broadening the scope of mandatory contents to be covered by maritime law courses required for the obtainment of the professional title of ship officer.

40|$|This Essay is Part Two of {{a two-part}} essay series that {{outlines}} and evaluates two possible future international instruments.

It entered into force in 2006. It {{has been adopted}} by sixty-six Contracting States (fifty-eight of which have adopted the Aircraft Protocol), including the U. S., China, the E. U., India, Ireland, Luxembourg, Russia, and South Africa. This Part of the Essay explores whether an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) feature for <b>the</b> <b>Convention,</b> similar <b>to</b> those typical of bilateral investment treaties (BITs), is needed, plausible, and feasible. It considers whether there are problems in the implementation and compliance by Contracting States that would warrant the costs of adopting an <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>to</b> create an ISDS regime.
