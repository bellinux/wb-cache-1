40|$|By {{studying}} {{the effect of}} hookworm <b>disease</b> <b>serum</b> injection on the iron metabolism in rabbits given such injections and. comparing the same in experimental anemia, the following conclusions have been drawn. 1. In the rabbits given injection of hookworm <b>disease</b> <b>serum,</b> serum iron shows a decrease, while non-hemin iron content in the viscera tends to show an increase in each fraction (4 non-hemin iron fractions of Yoneyama and Konno's method). 2. The results differ from those in phenylhydrazine anemia, collargol anemia and roentgen anemia; and consequently hemolysis, of course, and also a transient disturbance in bone marrow {{can not be considered}} as the causative factors of hookworm anemia. 3. From these findings there seems to exist a factor in serum, which inhibits iron mobilization, thus bringing about iron deficiency in the erythropoietic system in bone marrow; and this seems to constitute an important causative factor for the anemia in this disease...|$|R

Methods: Subjects comprised 94 patients admitted to a hospital or nursing home during the 5 years between April 2007 and April 2012 with central nervous symptoms. Serum SP levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay, and video endoscopy using a nasal endoscope in all subjects to ob-jectively evaluate swallowing function. Results: Serum SP level was very similar in central nervous disease without dysphagia and controls without central nervous <b>disease.</b> Conversely, <b>serum</b> SP level was significantly lower in central nervous disease with dysphagia. When comparing underlying <b>diseases,</b> <b>serum</b> SP was significantly lower in Parkinson’s disease than in other disease groups (cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease).

Independent of {{the severity of}} AE which occurs, gradual recovery is the rule and by the 6 th to 9 th week after sensitization rats appear clinically well and microscopic lesions of AE have virtually disappeared. Pooled serum collected from rats 3 or 6 weeks after sensitization contains complement-fixing (CF) antibrain antibodies.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the serum iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation and ferritin levels in common chronic liver disease like alcoholic cirrhosis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C and chronic hepatitis B. MATERIALS AND METHODS 110 consecutive patients with chronic liver disease admitted to the Gastroenterology Department, Government Medical College, Kozhikode were selected for the study. The categories of chronic liver disease included in our study were alcoholic cirrhosis (Group I, n = 40), cryptogenic cirrhosis (Group II, n = 30), chronic hepatitis C (Group III, n = 20) and chronic hepatitis B (Group IV, n = 20). Serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation were estimated in the fasting sample. Statistical Analysis- Analysis was performed using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni test to assess statistical significance of difference of continuous variables among and between groups, respectively. The results were considered statistically significant at the level of p < 0. 05.
