6000|$|Amidst many a [...] "good lack" [...] and exclamation of {{pity and}} indignation from Perronel, Ambrose told his tale of that strange night, and entreated {{her to come}} with him {{to do what was}} {{possible}} for Abenali and his daughter. She hesitated a little; her kind heart was touched, but she hardly liked to leave her house, in case her husband should come in, as he generally contrived to do in the early morning, now that the Cardinal's household was lodged so near her. Sheltered as she was by the buildings of the Temple, she had heard little or nothing of the noise of the riot, though she had been alarmed at her nephew's absence, and an officious neighbour had run in to tell her first that the prentice lads were up and sacking the houses of the strangers, and next that the Tower was firing on them, and the Lord Mayor's guard and the gentlemen of the Inns of Court were up in arms to put them down. She said several times, [...] "Poor soul!" [...] and [...] "Yea, it were a shame to leave her to the old Dutchkin," [...] but with true Flemish deliberation she continued her household arrangements, and insisted that the bowl of broth, which she set on the table, should be partaken of by herself and Ambrose before she would stir a step. [...] "Not eat! Now out on thee, lad! what good dost thou think thou or I can do if we come in faint and famished, where there's neither bite nor sup to be had? As for me, not a foot will I budge, till I have seen thee empty that bowl. So to it, my lad! Thou hast been afoot all night, and lookst so grimed and ill- favoured a varlet that no man would think thou camest from an honest wife's house. Wash thee <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pail!</b> Get thee into thy chamber and put on clean garments, or I'll not walk the street with thee! 'Tis not safe--thou wilt be put in ward for one of the rioters." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{replace the}} aged and {{unproductive}} dairy cows {{in this country}} from five to seven million calves must be raised annually. Of this number probably more than one-third prove worthless at maturity because of their very limited performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pail.</b> These calves are a financial loss both while they arc being grown and later when they are milked, because they fail to produce enough for a profit and because {{the value of their}} carcasses for beef is below the cost of growing. With the upward trend in the price of feed it behooves the dairyman to consider seriously what heifer calves can be raised with profit...|$|E

60|$|As {{she walked}} down the last of the zigzags leading to the cave, Benita stopped a moment {{thinking}} that she saw a light, and then went on, since on turning the corner there was nothing but darkness before her. Evidently she had been mistaken. She reached the well and hung <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> on to <b>the</b> great copper hook, wondering as she did so how many folk had done likewise in the far, far past, for the massive metal of that hook was worn quite thin with use. Then she let the roller run, {{and the sound of the}} travelling chain clanked dismally in that vaulted, empty place. <b>At</b> length <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> struck <b>the</b> water, and she began to wind up again, pausing at times to rest, for the distance was long and the chain heavy. The bucket appeared. Benita drew it to the side of the well, and lifted it from the hook, then took up her lamp to be gone.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Apparatus Faraday {{used in the}} experiment: a metal pail (A) is {{supported}} on a wooden stool (B) to insulate it from the ground. A metal ball (C) charged with static electricity can be lowered into <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> on a nonconducting silk thread. A gold leaf electroscope (E), a sensitive detector of electric charge, is attached by a wire {{to the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>pail.</b> When <b>the</b> charged ball is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> without touching it, the electroscope registers a charge, indicating that the ball induces charge in the metal container by electrostatic induction. An opposite charge is induced on the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>pail.</b> If <b>the</b> ball is touched to the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>pail,</b> <b>the</b> charge on both objects cancels out, showing that the induced charge had the same magnitude as the inducing charge on the ball.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the more}} {{advanced}} water closet (flush toilet) was popular in wealthy homes, {{the lack of an}} adequate water supply and poor sewerage meant that in 19th-century England, in working-class neighbourhoods, towns and cities often chose dry conservancy methods of waste disposal. [...] <b>The</b> <b>pail</b> closet was an evolution of the midden closet (privy midden or midden closet), an impractical and unsanitary amenity considered a nuisance to public health. [...] <b>The</b> <b>pail</b> system was popular in France and England, particularly in the historic Lancashire town of Rochdale, from which the system commonly took its name. [...] <b>The</b> <b>pail</b> closet was not without its own problems; if <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> was not emptied on a regular basis, it overflowed and became unhygienic. [...] Some manufacturers lined <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> with absorbent materials, and other designs used mixtures of dry earth or ash to disguise the smell.|$|R

5000|$|The Rochdale {{system was}} first used in 1869. It used a wooden tub, or pail (sometimes half of a {{petroleum}} barrel), which was placed under the closet seat. <b>The</b> <b>pails</b> were often circular (to aid cleaning), and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections. [...] The top of <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> carried a cast iron rim about 3 inches deep to receive a tight-fitting inner lid. <b>The</b> <b>pails</b> were collected {{on a weekly basis}} during <b>the</b> day. Each <b>pail</b> was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24-bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied, cleaned and returned. While <b>the</b> <b>pail</b> was removed from the closet, a replacement was installed in its place.

5000|$|In his {{original}} 1844 paper, Faraday also investigated {{the effect of}} using several conducting containers one inside the other. [...] He found that the induction effect works through multiple containers {{the same way it}} does through one container. He used four pails, each supported on a nonconductive pad inside the next. If a charge is lowered into <b>the</b> innermost <b>pail,</b> an exactly equal induced charge will appear on the outside of <b>the</b> outer <b>pail.</b> <b>The</b> charge on the outside of each pail induces an equal charge on the next. If one of <b>the</b> <b>pails</b> is grounded, <b>the</b> charge on all <b>the</b> <b>pails</b> outside it goes to zero.|$|R

5000|$|.....the {{absorption}} {{appeared to}} me to be trivial in pails used by women and children. Widely different degrees of sloppiness existed, obviously dependent upon differences in the families using the pails; but the extent of sloppiness noticed in Salford, in 1869, was rarely observed in Halifax, greater care being apparently taken in the latter town to avoid the emptying of chamber utensils into <b>the</b> <b>pails.</b> Probably <b>the</b> more regular locking of the doors of the closets, which is practiced in Halifax, contributes not a little to the exclusion of the contents of chamber utensils from <b>the</b> <b>pails,</b> less trouble being experienced in casting them into <b>the</b> yard drain. <b>At</b> any rate <b>the</b> aspect of <b>the</b> lined <b>pails</b> in use in Halifax generally, was less offensive to the eye than that of <b>the</b> simple <b>pail,</b> and <b>the</b> casting down of a portion of the lining, as I noticed in several instances, sufficed effectually to hide the offense and diminish the odor from <b>the</b> <b>pail.</b> John Netten Radcliffe (May 1874), commenting {{on the use of the}} Goux system in Halifax ...|$|R
