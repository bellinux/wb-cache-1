I've come to realize ways of making music without being excessive. I'm more at ease when I'm rapping. Whether it's music or fashion, the older I get, I realize what's comfortable lasts longer. <b>And</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is reflected in the new album." [...] G-Dragon mostly worked with YG's in house producers, Choice37, Teddy Park and Kush. In LOEN Entertainment's [...] "Ask in A Box" [...] interview, G-Dragon revealed that he took almost two years recording Coup d'Etat. He first recorded demos for [...] "Niliria" [...] and [...] "Runaway" [...] in 2011. When discussing why the album took years to be completed, the rapper said: [...] "There are various reasons why the second album took so long. Mostly, I just wanted to make things better and better. I have a lot of records that I sketched out, but they're not really organized properly. So instead of putting out incomplete records, I wanted to trim things down and make it super tight. That's why we put out the One of a Kind (2012) mini-album out first. With the remaining time, I redid the records, molded them, and now they're complete. Whenever I consider putting something out, I just feel like more needs to be done. I wouldn't say that I'm not confident, but it's more so a sense of feeling like I could make it better. That's why it took so long." ...|$|E

Even if my main message that people get is 'I don't know what's going on but I think you're all dicks... does anyone else feel like this?', that's {{important}} as no one was saying even that. Everyone was just letting it all go on, only saying 'ooh, isn't it terrible?', but not engaging or trying to understand why these things were happening, or not even having an opinion about our role in all of it. I just felt like I needed to say something, even if that is on a poppy-indie type record. Perhaps that's not {{the best way to do}} it, but I have that platform, so it's the one I used. Jonathan Higgs on the album's lyrics, in an interview with The Line of Best Fit The album's themes revolve around the current affairs of 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the British media's handling of the United Kingdom general election, as well as on the state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent [...] "watching rolling news" [...] and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of and violence, you've got rolling news and you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." ...|$|E

[...] However, a few months into development, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1) was deployed in Iraq and participated in the Second Battle of Fallujah. Tamte later stated that [...] "When they came back from Fallujah, they asked us to create a videogame about their experiences there, {{and it seemed like}} the right thing to do." [...] Tamte further stated that the goal of Six Days in Fallujah is to create the most realistic military shooter possible, and that [...] "Ultimately, all of us are curious about what it would really be like to be in a war. I've been playing military shooters for ages, and at a certain point when I'm playing the game, I know it's fake. You can tell a bunch of guys sat in a room and designed it. That's always bothered me.". Tamte further elaborated in {{an interview}} with Joystiq that, [...] "The words I would use to describe the game—first of all, it's compelling. And another word I use—insight. There are things that you can do in video games that you cannot do in other forms of media. <b>And</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has to do with presenting players with the dilemmas that the Marines saw in Fallujah and then giving them the choice of how to handle that dilemma. And I think at that point, you know - when you watch a movie, you see the decisions that somebody else made. But when you make a decision yourself, then you get a much deeper level of understanding.". Tamte describes the project as [...] "a meticulously recreated in-game version of Fallujah, complete with real life Marines lending their names and likenesses, as well as recreations of specific events from the battle.
