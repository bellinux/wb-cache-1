He printed all Cronshaw's best poems {{in the course of}} the article, so that when the volume appeared much of its point was gone; but he advanced his own position a good deal.

6000|$|But {{this is a}} wide {{step from}} the happy {{optimism}} of the Cambridge days. What becomes of the sanctity of marriage and {{the institution of the}} family when respectable gentlemen talk of something called [...] "True Marriage," [...] as non-existent in relation to a lady who is already the mother of four children? I record this lapsing of Mr. Brumley into romanticism without either sympathy or mitigation. The children, it presently became apparent, were not [...] "true" [...] children. [...] "Forced upon her," [...] said Mr. Brumley. [...] "It makes one ill to think of it!" [...] It certainly very nearly made him ill. And as if these exercises in distinction had inflamed his conscience Mr. Brumley wrote two articles in the Hebdomadal denouncing impure literature, decadence, immorality, various recent scandalous instances, and the suffragettes, declaring that woman's place was the home and that [...] "in a pure and exalted monogamy lies the sole unitary basis for a civilized state." [...] The most remarkable thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is an omission. That Sir Isaac's monogamy with any other instances that might be akin to it was not pure and exalted, and that it needed--shall we call it readjustment? is a view that in this article Mr. Brumley conspicuously doesn't display. It's as if for a moment, pen in hand, he had eddied back to his old absolute positions....|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} bombings, Soviet {{journalist}} Victor Louis (Vitaly Yevgenyevich Lui), a well known KGB agent provocateur, {{published an article}} about the involvement of Soviet dissidents in the bombings. After learning <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> Andrei Sakharov wrote an [...] "Appeal to world community", in which he requested an impartial investigation and suggested that the bombings might have been arranged by the KGB itself to discredit the entire Soviet dissident movement. He stated: [...] "I have serious grounds for concern. This is the provocation article in London Evening News by Victor Lui. These are arrests and interrogations of people who are clearly not related to the bombings. These are murders of last months, probably committed by the KGB which were not investigated. It is enough to mention only two of them: murder of poet Konstantin Bogatyrev and murder of lawyer Evgeni Brunov." [...] After this statement, Sakharov was not only attacked in Soviet newspapers but also received threats by phone. Several people tried to break into his apartment, claiming to be relatives of those killed in the Metro.|$|E

5000|$|When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola's {{daughter}} María {{discovered the}} paintings in Altamira and Sautuola, together with professor Vilanova, published their findings in 1880, Cartailhac {{was one of}} the leaders of the scientists who, suddenly facing a revolutionary change in the view of the prehistoric man, ridiculed these paintings at the 1880 Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon. Due to this opinion, the members of the congress did not even visit Altamira. He changed his mind after several other caves with clearly prehistoric paintings had been found and visited the cave with Breuill in 1902. He apologised there to María de Sautuola (her father died in 1888) and promised her to do everything to clear don Marcelino's name (Sautuola had even been accused of forgery). His letter from 9 October 1902 says among other things: [...] "We live in a new world". He also wrote a famous article, Mea culpa d'un sceptique in which he admitted he was deeply wrong, emphasized the importance of Altamira, accused himself of holding back the progress of his science, and harshly criticised himself for doing an injustice to an honest man and rejecting a thing without any investigation. Today, opinions <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> vary. Kleibl praises it as [...] "one of the finest moments of prehistory" [...] and a [...] "brave article, showing no fear of hurting his" [...] Cartailhac's [...] "professional credit", while Lewis-Williams writes about it as about an opportunist thing used calculatingly for Cartailhac's own benefit when his position was no longer tenable.|$|E
