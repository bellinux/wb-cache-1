25|$|<b>A</b> <b>diaper</b> (American English) or a nappy (British English) {{is a type}} of {{underwear}} that allows the wearer to defecate or urinate without the use of a toilet, by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change <b>a</b> <b>diaper</b> on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the diaper.|$|E

25|$|Bank Hall, {{built in}} the Jacobean style in 1608, is a brick built mansion of three storeys with Dutch gables and a square central tower on the south front. Some of the {{original}} brickwork in <b>a</b> <b>diaper</b> (lozenge) flushwork pattern is visible on one gable. The house was restored and enlarged by architect George Webster in 1832–3. He added a wing to the west elevations, built a porch on the north side, remodelled the 1608 north elevation windows, covered the roofs with blue Cumbrian slates and finished the walls with stone details. Webster carried out the alterations sympathetically, in a style corresponding to the 17th-century building, but the difference is marked by the colour of the brickwork and sharpness of the detail. Most windows were renewed during the restoration and two Italian style bay windows added to the south front, altering its appearance.|$|E
500|$|According to Nowalk, {{the idea}} to have Lexie wear <b>a</b> <b>diaper</b> {{to get through the}} {{operation}} was inspired by an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show.

He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be [...] "different", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that [...] "she acts, she sings, and now she directs".

It seems as though Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane, carefully reviewed the legal definition of broadcast indecency and set out to violate it as literally as he could." [...] The Parents Television Council went on to name the episode as its [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week", ending the week of May 7, 2010, citing the extreme indecency of the episode.|$|E

Dan was a heavy drinker who left the household to start another family while Ronnie was a toddler; Dan and Ruth divorced when Ronnie was 18months old. Six months later, Ronnie was found malnourished and wandering the streets alone in <b>a</b> <b>diaper.</b> Child welfare workers filed a [...] "failure to care" [...] petition and took him into custody, though they later returned him to his mother. Gardner's relationship with his father was tumultuous; Dan did not believe he was Gardner's biological father and frequently told his son of his belief.

"Give Peace a Chance" [...] {{opens with}} Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) {{implementing}} a new computerized surgical scheduling system, which is disliked {{by many of}} the hospital's staff. Thereafter, Isaac (Faran Tahir), a hospital lab technician, brings Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a scan of his tumor, which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity. Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it. Shepherd agrees, but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved. Shepherd ignores the chief's directions and schedules the surgery. The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor, so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room. After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) make a mistake, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is confident that she will win the competition, but loses to Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams). Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what would be a long surgery. Knowing that she {{will not be able to}} use the bathroom for the entire procedure, Lexie decides to wear <b>a</b> <b>diaper</b> into the operating room; her courage and dedication impresses Yang.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Harlem, Sims began performing {{on the street}} {{as he had done}} in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: [...] "I knew people who danced on dinner plates...

[...] He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the [...] "Amateur Night" [...] stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.When big name dancers played The Apollo, {{there was nothing in the}} audience but dancers with their shoes," [...] said Sandman Sims. [...] "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers.
