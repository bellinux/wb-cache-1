5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields.

5|$|This is a semiautomatic version {{manufactured}} for {{the civilian}} sport shooting market. Derived from the fully automatic military firearm, this version shares {{most of the}} major components of the military models {{with the exception of the}} firing mechanism and the addition of welded internal components to prevent conversion to a fully automatic mode.

5|$|Vanadinite is <b>an</b> <b>uncommon</b> mineral, only {{occurring}} as {{the result}} of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral.

Other associated minerals include wulfenite, limonite, and barite.|$|E

5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is <b>an</b> <b>uncommon</b> behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is <b>an</b> <b>uncommon</b> form {{of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the {{children}} go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

The {{following}} week, he successfully kicked {{nine out of}} nine extra points in a 63–6 blowout over Oregon. He was a first-team All-Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) selection in both 1950 and 1951, and was selected for the Associated Press (AP) 1951 All-America team as a fullback. Following his senior season he played in a regional college all-star game. McElhenny led the team in rushing {{in each of his}} three seasons and set sixteen school records, including season (1,107) and career (2,499) rushing yards.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used <b>an</b> <b>uncommon</b> plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{became a}} bestselling author in the 1890s. His children's poems were {{compiled}} {{into a book}} and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy.

He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke paralyzed his right arm in 1910.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not <b>an</b> <b>uncommon</b> practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms {{may indicate that}} OFC {{is the result of}} parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, <b>an</b> <b>uncommon</b> cancer of the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with. Symptoms are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E

Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
