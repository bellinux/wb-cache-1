5|$|Michigan State {{added to}} their lead {{at the start}} of the 2nd half with a 15-yard TD run by Glenn Winston. Michigan responded in the 4th quarter with a 60-yard {{touchdown}} by Darryl Stonum, <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> up just before time expired with a 92-yard drive capped by a 9-yard TD pass by Forcier to Roy Roundtree, taking the game to overtime. On its opening drive of overtime Forcier led Michigan down to the 8-yard line but then threw a tipped interception in the end zone, ending their threat. MSU's Larry Caper ended the game with a 23-yard TD run on 3rd down and 12, breaking three Michigan tackles that would have forced the Spartans to kick a field goal for the win.|$|E

John Callahan was unaware of any such incident, considering it a likely early flight of a stealth bomber, then in development. He asked the Alaskan Region to forward the relevant data to their technical center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he and his superior played back the radar data <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> in with the voice tapes by videotaping the concurrent playbacks.|$|E

25|$|In week 8, the Lions {{hosted the}} St. Louis Rams. The Rams {{got on the}} board first {{in the first quarter}} with a 41-yard field goal by Josh Brown. In the second quarter, the Lions' Matthew Stafford threw an {{interception}} into the end zone to James Butler but he was tackled by running back Kevin Smith for a Lions safety. Near halftime, the Rams performed a successful fake field goal when kicker Josh Brown passed it to Daniel Fells and he ran it in 36 yards for a touchdown. Both teams went scoreless in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Lions’ QB Matthew Stafford ran it in himself from 4 yards out for a TD, <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> up with a 2-point conversion catch by Maurice Morris. The Rams took the lead near the end though with a 25-yard run by Steven Jackson.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Miami drove 74 yards <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> at 24, with Strock's 15-yard {{touchdown}} completion to Rose. San Diego countered with a 6-play, 60-yard drive to score on Fouts' 25-yard touchdown completion to tight end Kellen Winslow. But Miami re-tied {{the game with}} Strock completing six consecutive passes, the last a 50-yard score to Bruce Hardy. Then Miami defensive back Lyle Blackwood's interception set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Nathan, giving Miami their first lead of the game, 38–31, on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later on, with Miami just trying to maintain their lead and run out the clock, Chargers safety Pete Shaw recovered a fumble from Andra Franklin on San Diego's 18-yard line with 4:39 left in regulation. Fouts then led his team down to Miami's nine-yard line. With only 58 {{seconds left in the}} game, a heavy Dolphins pass rush forced Fouts to throw a blind pass intended for Winslow in the end zone. The pass sailed over Winslow's head, but went right into the arms of Brooks for a touchdown to tie the game.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on August 9 to begin an interleague {{series against the}} Tampa Bay Rays. In the opener, the Rays jumped out to a 6-0 lead and David Price allowed only one unearned run through his seven innings. However, the Dodgers rallied against the Rays bullpen with two runs in the eighth and four in the ninth to win 7-6. Zack Greinke pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings, Adrian Gonzalez homered, Skip Schumaker had four hits and the Dodgers won the second game of the series, 5-0. Clayton Kershaw dominated in the series finale, striking out eight and allowing just 3 hits and 1 earned run in 8 strong innings, while driving in 2 runs on a second-inning single. The Dodgers won 8-2. The next day, they beat the New York Mets 4-2 as Nick Punto homered and Gonzalez had three hits and an RBI. The Dodgers record of 38-8 over their past 46 games was the franchise's best mark since the 1899 Brooklyn Superbas. Ryu pitched another good game the following day, beating Mets ace Matt Harvey {{to pick up his}} 12th win in the Dodgers 4-2 victory. On August 14, the Dodgers fell behind early 4-0 after 3 innings but again fought their way back <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> up on a two-run pinch hit homer by Andre Ethier {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Back-to-back doubles by Yasiel Puig and Gonzalez in the 12th gave them a 5-4 walk-off win. This was the 12th straight victory for the Dodgers in one-run games, a franchise record, and their 40th win in 48 games, the best mark in the Majors since the 1942 St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{helicopter}} attack, the PF and military personnel cordoned {{the area and}} conducted a thorough search of the premises. They initially discovered four abandoned vehicles that they suspected were owned by the perpetrators. In the vehicles, investigators discovered military uniforms with the insignias [...] "CJNG Special Forces High Command" [...] with five embedded stars. No immediate arrests were made. The Army seized several weapons from the CJNG, including 15 assault rifles, 6 handguns, 2 RPG launchers, 2 LAW rocket launchers, 10 rocket launcher missiles, 5 hand grenades, 92 chargers for multiple weapons, and 3,800 cartridges of different weapon calibers. Several of these weapons were illegal for civilians in Mexico because they were of exclusive use for the Mexican Armed Forces. Authorities also seized radio communication equipment, several bullet-proof vests, and nine vehicles. One of the vehicles was equipped with tools to carry a RPG launcher. Investigators handed these items over to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency.
