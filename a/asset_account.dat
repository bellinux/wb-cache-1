25|$|Debits and credits occur {{simultaneously}} in every financial transaction in double-entry bookkeeping. In the accounting equation—Assets = Liabilities + Equity—if an <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> increases (a debit), then either another <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> must decrease (a credit), or a liability or equity account must increase (a credit).|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (<b>asset)</b> <b>account</b> in his ledger {{when making}} a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "X" [...] in {{the debit}} column denotes the {{increasing}} {{effect of a}} transaction on the <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> balance (total debits less total credits), because a debit to an <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> is an increase. The <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> above {{has been added to}} by a debit value X, i.e. the balance has increased by £X or $X. Likewise, in the liability account below, the X in the credit column denotes the increasing effect on the liability account balance (total credits less total debits), because a credit to a liability account is an increase.|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, a {{decrease}} to an <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> is a credit. [...] A decrease to a liability or equity account is a debit.|$|E
2500|$|Whether a debit {{increases}} or decreases {{an account}} {{depends on what}} kind of account it is. An increase to an <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> is a debit. [...] An increase to a liability or to an equity account is a credit.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} {{fundamental}} elements within accounting. These elements are as follows: Assets, Liabilities, Equity (or Capital), Income (or Revenue) and Expenses. The five accounting elements are all affected {{in either a}} positive or negative way. A credit transaction does not always dictate a positive value or increase in a transaction and similarly, a debit does not always indicate a negative value or decrease in a transaction. An <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "debit account" [...] due to the account's standard increasing attribute on the debit side. When an asset (e.g. an espresso machine) has been acquired in a business, the transaction will affect the debit side of that <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> illustrated below: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is designed to}} identify factors that determine the management decisions to choose {{one or the other}} tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> method. The article offers a systematic analysis of factors determining the choice of tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods that is based on research by Lithuanian and foreign scientists and hypotheses of the positive accounting theory. The research produced a theoretical result: it identified groups of factors that determine the choice of tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods including a flow chart of the factor and accounting method interaction, which can be used to develop a profit increasing or profit decreasing accounting policy. The factors are broken down into factors of the internal and external environment. Financial and human factors are attributable to the internal environment factors, while economic and technological factors are regarded as factors of the external environment. It was found that the financial leverage and the firm value maximization are the key factors in the financial factor group as they affect the management determination to opt for profit increasing tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods, while technological factors have an effect on profit decreasing tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> policy choice. Economic (the national economic situation and factors of the political process, such as the size of the company, its profitability, and the industry branch it belongs to) and human factors provide an opportunity to use both: profit increasing or profit decreasing tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods. The research results will contribute to a most correct choice of the tangible fixed <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods by the company management, appropriate management decisions, and achievement of the objectives...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{competition}} from {{banks and other}} financial institutions has forced life insurers to find new and innovative ways to obtain and retain capital. Retained <b>asset</b> <b>accounts</b> are a newer form of life insurance settlement option in which the insurer holds death proceeds in its general account until the beneficiaries are ready to withdrawal the funds. While beneficiaries are compensated with interest on the accounts, the funds {{are subject to the}} financial risk of the insurer and are only partially covered by state guaranty funds. Given the characteristics of the retained accounts, primary interest is the examination of whether the interest rate paid to the owners of retained <b>asset</b> <b>accounts</b> is related to the insurer’s level of risk. In order to better understand these issues, first, one must understand the characteristics associated with an insurer’s decision to obtain capital through this method as well as the level of use of retained <b>asset</b> <b>accounts.</b> In this context, the potential relation of interest paid to beneficiaries and firm risk is discussed. Results show that those insurers associated with greater financial risk compensate the owners of retained <b>asset</b> <b>accounts</b> through the payment of increased interest payment on the funds held in the account. In addition, larger and more financially stable insurers are more likely to utilize retained <b>asset</b> <b>accounts</b> as a life insurance settlement option...|$|R
2500|$|All {{accounts}} have corresponding {{contra accounts}} {{depending on what}} transaction has taken place e.g., when a vehicle is purchased using cash, the <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> [...] "Vehicles" [...] is debited as the vehicle account increases, and simultaneously the <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> [...] "Bank" [...] is credited due to the payment for the vehicle using cash. Some balance sheet items have corresponding contra accounts, with negative balances, that offset them. Examples are accumulated depreciation against equipment, and allowance for bad debts (also known as allowance for doubtful accounts) against accounts receivable. United States GAAP utilizes the term contra for specific accounts only and doesn't recognize {{the second half of}} a transaction as a contra, thus the term is restricted to accounts that are related. For example, sales returns and allowance and sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit). To understand the actual value of sales, one must net the contras against sales, which gives rise to the term net sales (meaning net of the contras).|$|E
2500|$|The {{bank account}} of a {{business}} is [...] "a resource controlled by the entity" [...] as {{it belongs to the}} business. [...] "As a result of past events" [...] such as the opening of the business.

This basic analogy can be applied to any <b>asset</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{business}} will most often {{have more than}} one <b>asset</b> <b>account.</b> An essential <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> in any business is the business's bank account (see: [...] "Accounts pertaining to the five accounting elements" [...] below for more examples) The same applies to liability accounts i.e. if I have borrowed money from two sources (called creditors or payables), then I must open two accounts to represent this present liability, called 'Creditor/Payable A' and 'Creditor/Payable B'. In this manner I may have multiple, different accounts. However all these accounts are all classified as one of the five types of accounts, therefore my entire business can be described in terms of its assets, expenses, liabilities, income and equity/capital (see extended accounting equation). This is the extent of [...] "my" [...] business in relation to accounts, regardless of the business' practices (the business may be a retail franchise, furniture shop, restaurant, etc.). With respect to my business, each of the five accounting elements will have a monetary value, and this can be used to assess the financial position of my business at any time (my success, failure, or any other attributes that I might need to know).|$|E

2500|$|From the bank's {{point of}} view, when a debit card {{is used to}} pay a merchant, the payment causes a {{decrease}} in the amount of money the bank owes to the cardholder. From the bank's point of view, your debit card account is the bank's liability. [...] A decrease to the bank's liability account is a debit. From the bank's point of view, when a credit card is used to pay a merchant, the payment causes an increase in the amount of money the bank is owed by the cardholder. From the bank's point of view, your credit card account is the bank's asset. An increase to the bank's <b>asset</b> <b>account</b> is a debit.

40|$|Changes in the {{accounting}} profession {{and in the}} way organizations are managed and operated {{over the past several decades}} have led to the identification of a new factor that makes up a substantial part of the value of an organization: human capital. The value that employees add to organizations, however, has been difficult to measure because of the many elements that comprise it and aspects of human nature and free will that are involved. Many models have been proposed to capture the value that organizations gain from employees, but none have succeeded in full. Additionally, strict financial reporting regulations would require an accurate and uniform method of accounting for human capital in order to give much relevance to the data collected. Despite its complex nature, the field of human <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> continues to gain momentum and is headed in the right direction. The development of a universal method of accounting for human capital would provide a much more exact valuation of organizations and have deep benefits for owners, managers, investors, accountants, and human resource employees.
