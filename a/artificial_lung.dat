25|$|Modern organ {{transplantation}} in Iran dates to 1935, {{when the first}} cornea transplant in Iran was performed by Professor Mohammad-Qoli Shams at Farabi Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The Shiraz Nemazi transplant center, {{also one of the}} pioneering transplant units of Iran, performed the first Iranian kidney transplant in 1967 and the first Iranian liver transplant in 1995. The first heart transplant in Iran was performed 1993 in Tabriz. The first lung transplant was performed in 2001, and the first heart and lung transplants were performed in 2002, both at Tehran University. Iran developed the first <b>artificial</b> <b>lung</b> in 2009 to join five other countries in the world that possess such technology. Currently, renal, liver, and heart transplantations are routinely performed in Iran. Iran ranks fifth in the world in kidney transplants. The Iranian Tissue Bank, commencing in 1994, was the first multi-facility tissue bank in country. In June 2000, the Organ Transplantation Brain Death Act was approved by the Parliament, followed by the establishment of the Iranian Network for Transplantation Organ Procurement. This act helped to expand heart, lung, and liver transplantation programs. By 2003, Iran had performed 131 liver, 77 heart, 7 lung, 211 bone marrow, 20,581 cornea, and 16,859 renal transplantations. 82percent of these were donated by living and unrelated donors; 10percent by cadavers; and 8percent came from living-related donors. The 3-year renal transplant patient survival rate was 92.9%, and the 40-month graft survival rate was 85.9%.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{modification}} by functional groups promotes endothelialization in biohybrid <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs,</b> {{but whether}} it affects endothelial cell stability under fluid shear stress, {{and the release of}} anti-thrombotic factors, e. g. nitric oxide (NO), is unknown. We aimed to test whether surface-modified silicone tubes containing different functional groups, but similar wettability, improve collagen immobilization, endothelialization, cell stability and cell-mediated NO-release. Peroxide, carboxyl, and amine-groups increased collagen immobilization (41 - 76 %). Only amine-groups increased ultimate tensile strength (2 -fold). Peroxide and amine enhanced (1. 5 - 2. 5 [*]fold), but carboxyl-groups decreased (2. 9 -fold) endothelial cell number after 6 [*]d. After collagen immobilization, cell numbers were enhanced by all group-modifications (2. 8 - 3. 8 [*]fold). Cells were stable under 1 [*]h-fluid shear stress on amine, but not carboxyl or peroxide-group-modified silicone (> 50 % cell detachment), while cells were also stable on carboxyl-group-modified silicone with immobilized collagen. NO-release was increased by peroxide and amine (1. 1 - 1. 7 [*]fold), but decreased by carboxyl-group-modification (9. 8 -fold), while it increased by all group-modifications after collagen immobilization (1. 8 - 2. 8 [*]fold). Only the amine-group-modification changed silicone stiffness and transparency. In conclusion, silicone-surface modification of blood-contacting parts of <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs</b> with carboxyl and amine, but not peroxide-groups followed by collagen immobilization allows the formation of a stable functional endothelial cell layer. Amine-group-modification seems undesirable since it affected silicone's physical properties...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} describes {{laser machining}} of microchannel branching networks into silicon. The branching network {{is designed to}} serve as gas exchangers for use in <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs</b> and simulates physiological flow; mimicking the tree-like vascular structure of natural lung. In the development of such micro-fluidic structures, the flexibility of laser direct writing facilitates creation of three-dimensional multi-level structure. And, the maskless process will reduce time and cost {{compared to that of}} conventional photolithography technique. First, near-IR nanosecond ablation of silicon is studied. An emphasis has been placed on the improvement of the surface quality of nanosecond ablation. An acid etching post process step is introduced to clean out debris-buildup caused by strong thermal reaction of the irradiated silicon. Influences of processing parameters on the depth and the surface morphology of laser ablation followed by acid etching are investigated. Combinations of laser processing parameters are optimized to create a wide range of microchannel sizes with reasonable surface quality. Second, femtosecond ablation of silicon is experimentally and numerically studied. While providing better surface quality and resolution than nanosecond pulses, relatively low productivity of femtosecond pulses has limited its contribution in practical applications. Investigations on the effect of processing parameters are conducted to improve processing speed and to achieve a wide range of microchannel sizes with reasonable surface quality. Optimized processing condition provides macroscopic material removal as well as micron scale precision. To understand the non-thermal process of femtosecond ablation of silicon, a numerical model is simulated. The modeling considers two characteristic mechanisms: free electron (or electron-hole pair) generation and electron-phonon interaction before thermal equilibrium. Finally, the blood flow and the oxygen transfer in the microchannel networks are characterized by both experiments and numerical simulations. In the simulation, the shear thinning non-Newtonian characteristic of the blood viscosity and the oxygen-hemoglobin binding are taken into account. The simulation results demonstrate the benefit of gas exchangers designed using Murray’s law. The laser technique developed in this study provides the ability to mimic the feature of the natural vasculature in development of <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs.</b> The physiological features are expected to contribute to further development of <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs...</b>|$|R

50|$|The early <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs</b> used {{relatively}} impermeable polyethylene or Teflon homogeneous membranes, {{and it was}} {{not until}} more highly permeable silicone rubber membranes were introduced in the 1960s (and as hollow fibres in 1971) that the membrane oxygenator became commercially successful. The introduction of microporous hollow fibres with very low resistance to mass transfer revolutionized the design of membrane modules, as the limiting factor to oxygenator performance became the blood resistance. Current designs of oxygenator typically use an extraluminal flow regime, where the blood flows outside the gas filled hollow fibers, for short term life support, while only the homogeneous membranes are approved for long term use.|$|R

40|$|Blood-contacting devices {{interact}} with blood during their function {{much like the}} endothelium that modulates hemostasis. The surfaces of these devices however, lack endothelial-like properties, and consequently, upon blood contact, activate clotting factors to form clots. Systemic heparinization for inhibiting clot formation can cause bleeding and surface coatings show insignificant benefits. This research investigated nitric oxide (NO) production mimicry of the endothelium on <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs</b> (ALs) and pediatric catheters. Their surfaces were functionalized either by (1) entrapping NO donors inside their bulk, (2) incorporating catalysts to generate NO from NO-donors or (3) supplementing NO into sweep gas of <b>artificial</b> <b>lungs.</b> Pediatric catheters functionalized with NO-donor thin coats using method 1 is limited by short NO release duration. Method 2 has not been applied to large surface-area, low-flow devices like the AL. In this work NO-generating silicone membranes were synthesized and characterized to determine the relationship between surface properties, NO flux, and blood clotting time. These outcomes helped develop and optimize NO-generating gas-exchange silicone fibers that represent the majority of ALs surface area. The first NO-generating AL prototypes, using those fibers, were manufactured, incorporated into NO-generating circuits and tested for their non-thrombogenicity. To test for NO-release duration and non-thrombogenicity, catheters were fabricated to incorporate NO-donors inside their walls, characterized for NO flux and release duration by chemiluminescence, and tested for patency using a thrombogenicity model in rabbits. Methods 1 - 2 involve material modification using complicated and expensive chemical formulations and/or manufacturing. Method 3 however, functionalizes ALs by only adding NO into sweep gas. Decade-long anti-clotting testing using {{a wide range of}} NO concentrations has been conducted without knowledge of what concentration yields endothelial NO flux levels in the AL. This concentration was determined for the MC 3 Biolung and the Terumo capiox rx 25 ALs in vitro. All these ideas have shown positive results in short-term studies, and each may play a necessary role in inhibiting clot formation in future ALs. The sufficiency however, of each idea or of a combination for clot inhibition in long-term ALs remains to be determined...|$|R

Working independently, Brukhonenko in the USSR and John Heysham Gibbon in the USA demonstrated the feasibility of extracorporeal oxygenation. Brukhonenko used excised dog lungs while Gibbon used a direct contact drum type oxygenator, perfusing cats for up to 25 minutes in the 1930s.|$|E

The resistance of each attachment mode was increased incrementally and instantaneous pulmonary system hemodynamic data were acquired at each increment.
