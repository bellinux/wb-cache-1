Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott.

In 1980, WSET won FCC approval to relocate its transmitter to Thaxton Mountain near Bedford, halfway between Roanoke and Lynchburg. WSET activated its new transmitter in 1982, which gave the station a clear signal in most of Roanoke {{for the first time}} ever. However, the FCC required WSET to significantly conform its signal to protect WOWK. As a result, some areas of {{the western part of the}} market, including parts of Roanoke itself, only got a grade B signal; they only got a clear signal from the station until cable arrived in the area a few years later.|$|E

He {{commanded}} his servant (whom the Torah commentators identify as Eliezer of Damascus) to journey to his birthplace of Aram Naharaim to select a bride from his own family, rather than engage Isaac to a local Canaanite girl. Abraham sent along expensive jewelry, clothing and dainties as gifts to the bride and her family. If the girl had refused to follow him, Abraham stated that Eliezer would be absolved of his responsibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled {{all aspects of the}} ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.|$|E

At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army and, to some degree, under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find a good reason, as the king would countermand any legal process {{in order to save}} his favorites.

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> killer, but <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the up-tempo dance song [...] "Lose My Breath", a track {{detailing}} a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. [...] "Soldier", the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and Crunk. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover {{from the opening}} song, the protagonists ask for a decent soldier, further singing <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the R number [...] "Cater 2 U", lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} {{discussed}} in this thesis is <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>an</b> enclo- sure of the solution set of an interval linear system with linear dependencies. We get familiar with definitions from interval arithmetic and analysis.

Most of them are implemented in MATLAB using INTLAB library. We compare their precision and computational time on Toeplitz, symmetric and random matrices. For depen- dencies we design our memory saving representation. The results are interpreted and the final function, which can compute either fast, sharp or memory efficient, is build on individual methods. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
500|$|... "In the Middle" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} {{elements}} of R and funk. The Jerusalem Posts Harry Rubenstein {{described it as}} a [...] "club-style experimental".

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V.

The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plotâ€™s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter <b>about</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> new place for them to live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astridâ€”and really not discovering much, except that she doesnâ€™t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astridâ€™s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E
