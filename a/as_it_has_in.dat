5|$|In Glenfinnan, the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> {{the past}} films. Aerial scenes were shot in Glen Coe, in Clachaig Gully, and Glen Etive, which, {{at the time}} of filming, {{was one of the few}} places in Scotland without snow, making it ideal for a backdrop.|$|E
5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E
5|$|Locations in England {{included}} the River Thames, {{for the flight}} of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and the flight of Dumbledore's Army to the Ministry of Magic. This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye, Canary Wharf, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the HMS Belfast. Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past. A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{fractured}} {{nature of the}} opposition, Éamon de Valera's tactic of calling a snap general election <b>had</b> succeeded, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1933 and 1938.|$|R
50|$|Estacado {{continued}} to suffer. The Quakers moved elsewhere. In {{the early part}} of the 20th century, the population again saw an increase, but never again saw as many residents <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1890.|$|R
50|$|Finally, in a {{transcriptome}} wide assay {{in chronic}} wound, fortyfold higher expression Sulf1 was noted in wound-site vessels. This increase {{was attributed to}} its ability to inhibit angiogenesis <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> breast cancer models.|$|R
25|$|Historically, the Indian {{team has}} not {{performed}} as well overseas <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> India. Since the year 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements {{under the guidance}} of coach John Wright and captain Saurav Ganguly. The team drew a Test series with Australia in Australia, which is usually considered a tough tour. It was followed by a historic Test and ODI series win against arch-rivals Pakistan while playing in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} diseases {{also made a}} resurgence {{around the same time}} as prostitution, and have been directly linked to prostitution. There are fears that prostitution may become the main route of HIV transmission <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> developing countries such as Thailand and India. Some regions have introduced a policy of 100% condom use, inspired by a similar measure in Thailand. Other interventions have been introduced recently at some sites, including STI services, peer education and voluntary counselling and testing for HIV.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about safety in {{operating}} the aircraft; there have been 337 fatalities from MU-2 crashes. As of October 2005, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) undertook a safety evaluation of the aircraft. It concluded that the aircraft has met its certification requirements: It is safe when operated by properly trained pilots who operate properly maintained aircraft. The FAA {{is in the process}} of mandating training specific to the MU-2, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past for other aircraft. When such mandated training was required outside of the U.S., the MU-2 accident record was vastly improved.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} year of the second {{generation}} Firebirds (1981), Trans Am still used the same engines <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the previous model year, with the only change being the addition of a new electronic carburetion system.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 2012, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 2008, The Salt Lake Tribune {{endorsed}} Barack Obama for the presidency, despite opponent Mitt Romney's {{connections with}} both Mormonism and Salt Lake City, having <b>had</b> a hand <b>in</b> organizing their 2002 Olympic Games.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)—which oversees the {{electricity}} industry nationally—began enabling {{the restructuring of}} wholesale electric power. They believed competition would provide needed renewal, much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> transportation, telecommunications and financial services.|$|R
25|$|Kuhn {{states that}} the {{probabilistic}} tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall {{under one of the}} paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has.</b> <b>In</b> the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.|$|E
500|$|Saints Row: The Third {{introduced}} experience {{levels and}} weapon upgrades to the series. Most {{actions in the}} game come with incentives {{in the form of}} money and respect (reputation). Money buys land, weapons, and other upgrades, and respect is a kind of experience point that can unlock player abilities like [...] "no damage from falling" [...] or [...] "infinite sprint", as well as upgrades to the player's computer-controlled gang member support. In turn, players receive further incentive to nearly miss car collisions, streak naked through the streets, shoot others in the groin, blow up Smart cars, and kill mascots in ambient challenges to earn more respect. Lack of respect does not hinder story progress, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> previous games. Player progress and unlocks are managed by an in-game cell phone menu that also lets the player call for vehicle deliveries and non-player character backup. The computer-controlled support will also dialogue with each other.|$|E
500|$|On January 20 {{that year}} the Soviets {{announced}} that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten-day period. The Albanians later {{claimed that the}} specialists had sabotaged Albania's oil installations before departing. [...] Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the Palace of Culture of Tirana {{on the occasion of}} his 1959 visit, all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961. A shipment of materials for the Palace, which arrived in Durrës, was [...] "withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials 'had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania.'" [...] On April 23 a Sino–Albanian trade agreement was concluded; Soviet First Deputy Premier Alexei Kosygin sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet–Albanian trade agreements. Among other things it stated that [...] "It is understandable that the Albanian leadership cannot expect in the future that the USSR will help it <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past, with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit." [...] On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana [...] "and was never to return." [...] On August 26, [...] "only five days before the beginning of the fall semester," [...] the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR; these students given a deadline to leave by October. An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that, [...] "The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five-year Plan in the industrial sector alone. Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid. Thus {{in the first years of}} the 3rd Five-year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{help finance}} its policies, Scaddan's {{government}} introduced {{an income tax}} in 1912, and this was greatly increased after World War I broke out. [...] It also borrowed heavily, and state debt increased as much in Scaddan's five years <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the previous 13 years.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the general}} {{expectation}} was that, with President Barack Obama having {{the advantage of}} incumbency and being the only viable candidate running, the race would be primarily pro forma. The process ran essentially the same <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 2008, and voter turnout was extremely low.|$|R
50|$|After {{the statehouse}} at Jamestown burned in 1698, the {{legislature}} moved temporarily to Middle Plantation, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the past. Upon suggestion of {{students of the}} College, the capital was permanently relocated there. Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg in 1699. Nearby, Archer's Hope Creek was renamed as College Creek.|$|R
2500|$|In Dutch, the {{equivalent}} of [...] "thou", du, also became archaic and fell out of use {{and was replaced by}} the Dutch equivalent of [...] "you", gij (later jij or u), just <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> English, with the place of the informal plural taken by jullie (cf. English you people, you guys).|$|E
2500|$|The Table of Derivations {{also shows}} that certain {{definitions}} which were inserted {{for the purpose of}} the consolidation included one to make clear that where there is a reference to [...] "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> section 14 (not vice versa): in section 14(1) the phrase is expanded as [...] "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".|$|E
2500|$|... 'Yes to the EU' {{does not}} mean we are content with the union {{continuing}} to operate <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past. There is a huge democratic deficit in its functioning, a serious bias towards the interests of neoliberalism and 'the market', and central institutions have been overbuilt. But to achieve those reforms {{we need to work}} with fellow EU members, not try to dictate high handedly to them, as David Cameron has done.|$|E
50|$|After the 1930s the {{popularity}} of mandolin ensembles once again began to decline, though not <b>as</b> completely <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century. Mandolins continued to be produces, but production of {{other members of the}} family decreased significantly, although—with the possible exception of the mandobass—it never died out completely.|$|R
50|$|During the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the {{composer}} invited {{members of the}} IOC executive board to hear the work sung by an opera star from Munich. In February 1936, the IOC declared Strauss’s composition as the Olympic anthem “for all time” much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1933 for Bradley-Keeler's composition.|$|R
5|$|The Giro concluded, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 2008, {{with another}} {{individual}} time trial, {{this time in}} the city of Rome.

2500|$|The {{composition}} of the Uranian atmosphere {{is different from that}} of Uranus as a whole, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium. The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of hydrogen/helium, was determined from the analysis of Voyager 2 far infrared and radio occultation observations. The currently accepted value is [...] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction [...] This value is very close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of , indicating that helium has not settled towards the centre of the planet <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the gas giants.|$|E
2500|$|Homeschooling in South America has {{not taken}} hold <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> North American {{countries}} of Canada and the United States. [...] In 1824, Brazil permitted home education {{to take the place}} of traditional education for nearly 70 years. [...] In 1990, however, The Statute of Children and Adolescents, or the Estatuto da Criança e Adolescente, prohibited homeschooling and did not recognize it as a legitimate form of education. [...] A resurgence in the homeschooling movement, however, has encouraged congressman Lincoln Portela to introduce a new bill that would allow children to be educated at home if parents followed state approved guidelines. [...] The National Association of Home Education was founded in 2010 to achieve these goals. Rough estimates state that around 3,201 families are homeschooling in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{and during}} WWII, the US Navy instituted the {{procurement}} and modification of civilian/commercial vessels <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> times of conflict since the Revolution. The effort {{began in earnest}} with the efforts to enforce the Neutrality Patrols and continued past December 1941. In fact of the “Patrol” types available prior to December 1941, {{the majority of them}} were acquired, converted craft (PG, PY, PYc). The Navy extended the acquisitions especially of fishing vessels to fill mine-sweeping and harbor patrol duties (AM, AMc types). [...] The US Coast Guard (under the command of the US Navy) continued to acquire commercial and fishing vessel types as Patrol Cutters (WPG, WYP, WYPc, WAK) into early stages of the war with 95% being utilized to the east coast but the majority assigned to the Greenland Patrol.|$|E
25|$|Also by 1997, MTV {{was criticized}} heavily for not playing as many music videos <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the past.

It is the argument that today, if we go before the laborers, we must offer them something right away. I answer to you that today, if we are to go into the field of competitive bidding for votes, either of the old political parties can outbid us. If we demand the government ownership of railways, telephones, and means of communication, if we demand the nationalization of the mines, what are we? A handful whose demand is but a hollow cry.|$|E
2500|$|While {{recovering}} at home, Don {{realizes that}} his job does not influence {{him as much}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past.

[...] After finding Charlie's converted police scanner, Don cautions Charlie about the risk of burnout from police work. [...] Fifteen minutes after leaving, Don receives a phone call from Charlie saying that Amita has been kidnapped. [...] Throughout the investigation, Don keeps putting himself in Charlie's shoes and even asks Larry to help with the math. [...] When they find Amita, Don is the one to reunite Amita and Charlie.

2500|$|Richard Dawkins {{stated that}} [...] "the authors seem {{undecided}} whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness. Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs {{none of the}} hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us", concluding that the film is [...] "tosh". Professor Clive Greated wrote that [...] "thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the movie, stating: [...] "I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing." [...] Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion [...] "that if observing water changes its molecular structure, {{and if we are}} 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics" [...] was [...] "ridiculous balderdash". According to João Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a [...] "pseudoscientific docudrama", saying [...] "Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought." ...|$|E
