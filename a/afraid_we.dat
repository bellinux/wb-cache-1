25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were <b>afraid.</b> <b>We</b> didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were {{secretly}} praying that nothing violent happened.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that the runway at Ouani Airport close to Mutsamudu was blocked with baggage trolleys and the atmosphere was tense as the island braced itself for the impending assault. [...] Before the telephone lines were cut an Anjouan government spokesperson was quoted as saying: [...] "They have decided to kill {{but we are not}} <b>afraid.</b> <b>We</b> are well prepared. Our forces are ready and it's going to work!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1959, {{at the age}} of 67, {{he retired}} to his [...] farm across the Delaware River in Moorestown, New Jersey which mostly {{produced}} grain. [...] He {{died of a heart attack}} in Mount Laurel, New Jersey on June 17, 1961. Former Vanderbilt quarterback Tommy Henderson said after learning of Cody's death: Josh was one of my closest friends until he went to Temple. After that I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> lost contact. He had a lasting influence on the men who played for him. He was kind and considerate but demanding, too. He was a fine defensive basketball coach who believed in aggressive defensive fundamentals. In football, he was respected for what he knew and what he could do with his material." ...|$|E

500|$|The plane scene {{during which}} {{passengers}} die in mid-air was created inside {{a very large}} sound stage. The three-ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically. [...] "We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people," [...] special effects supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the on-board sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. [...] Sawa said that [...] "the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real". [...] Wong said, [...] "You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, 'What have I done?' I was <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> were gonna have 40 extras vomiting." ...|$|E
500|$|After Harrison turned 18 and the {{immigration}} problems had been solved, the Beatles {{went back to}} Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club, playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961. To secure their return, Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities, which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter. Fellow musician, Tony Sheridan, later remembered the living conditions at the club: “John, George, Paul, Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn. We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks. It was terrible really, now I look back. We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry. But we had great times and I’m <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> used to tease {{the life out of}} the old lady who [...] us.” ...|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to 11 January protests police used riot gear to disperse protesters ransacking buildings, burning tires, {{setting fire to}} a bus and burning two cars in the working class suburb of Ettadhamen-Mnihla in Tunis. The protesters {{were said to have}} chanted [...] "We are not <b>afraid,</b> <b>we</b> are not <b>afraid,</b> <b>we</b> are afraid only of God." [...] Military personnel were also deployed in many cities around the country.|$|E
2500|$|Sexism {{is said to}} pervade {{the memoir}} of one peer, James Watson, in his book The Double Helix {{published}} 10 years after Franklin's death and after Watson had returned from Cambridge to Harvard. His Cambridge colleague, Peter Pauling, wrote in a letter, [...] "Morris [...] Wilkins {{is supposed to be}} doing this work; Miss Franklin is evidently a fool." [...] Crick acknowledges later, [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> always used to adopt– let's say, a patronizing attitude towards her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Canterbury {{asked to}} play on even terms, with 11 players a side, but the Australians refused, hoping to prolong the game and thus {{increase}} the gate takings. Eventually it was settled that Canterbury would field 15 players, but before the match the reporter in the Christchurch newspaper The Lyttelton Times regretted {{the decision not to}} field 18. Without exceptional luck, he said, [...] "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> shall {{have to put up with}} defeat". Interest in the match was high, and the largest Christchurch businesses and law firms closed on each day of the match at midday, which was the scheduled time for play to begin.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993 RTÉ {{produced}} a sitcom {{set in a}} newspaper office called [...] Extra! Extra! Read All About It! (also known as Extra! Extra!). It was poorly received, critics stating the scripts lacked any humour and that the direction was poor. Reviewing the programme for the Sunday Independent, writer Colm Tóibín called it [...] "probably the worst programme RTÉ has ever shown". The Irish Times Brendan Glacken was equally scathing: [...] "Speaking of Extra! Extra!, as I am <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> still must, even seasoned RTÉ observers seem unable {{to answer the question}} why a series so pathetically weak should have been allowed to reach the screen at all". The Irish Independent later listed it as one of the worst Irish TV shows ever.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 December 2007, updates by Jagex removed free player-versus-player {{combat and}} {{unbalanced}} trading {{in order to}} rid the game of activities involving real currency being traded for virtual goods. The updates also affected legitimate players, resulting in many of them actively complaining on the forums. Jagex issued a Customer Support News article admitting the updates {{may not have been}} an ideal replacement for what was removed, requesting patience and promising to remedy potential problems with updates in the future. During the changes, subscription numbers fell by 60,000. No figures were given as to how many of those subscriptions belonged to legitimate players and how many to gold farmers. In an interview in February 2008, Jagex's head of content stated that, [...] "we were really <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> were going to lose our members over this change, because other games had in the past. But we are very, very pleased to say that we have lost practically none of our members." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his December 5, 2006 column {{entitled}} [...] "A {{response to}} my many critics—and a solution", Prager's solution in the title is for Ellison to swear on the Islamic Qur'an which he believes to be sacred along with the Christian Bible which he does not. Prager wrote [...] "It is not I, but Keith Ellison, who has engaged in disuniting the country. He can still help reunite it by simply bringing both books to his ceremonial swearing-in. Had he originally {{announced that he would}} do that, I would have written a different column -- filled with praise of him. And {{there would be a lot}} less cursing and anger in America." [...] In a December 7, 2006 interview, Prager continued along these lines, saying [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>we</b> are becoming a diverse, secular society without any roots, and this is symbolically an example of that. The Bible is the repository of our values, not the Constitution...and I'm asking him to honor that and include the Bible along with the Koran." ...|$|E
