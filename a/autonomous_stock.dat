5000|$|Italian {{anthropologist}} Giuseppe Sergi {{claimed that}} the Mediterranean race was [...] "the greatest race in the world". He defined it as [...] "the finest brunet race which has appeared in Europe…derived neither from the black nor white peoples, but constituting an <b>autonomous</b> <b>stock</b> in the human family.". Sergi {{claimed that the}} Mediterranean Race probably historically spoke a Hamitic language related {{to the language of}} the prehistoric Egyptians, Iberians, and Libyans. Sergi noted that the Roman Empire led to the spread of Mediterranean civilization across Europe and thus contemporary European civilization was bound by ancestry to the Mediterranean race.|$|E
5000|$|Giuseppe Sergi {{asserted}} that the Mediterranean race was [...] "the greatest race... derived neither from the black nor white people... an <b>autonomous</b> <b>stock</b> in the human family." [...] Italian Fascism initially adhered strongly to a similar version of Mediterraneanism that claimed a bond existed between all Mediterranean cultures and Mediterranean peoples, often placing Mediterranean people and cultures above other cultures, such as Nordic cultures. This form of Mediterraneanism was partially {{a response to the}} then-popular Nordicist racial theory, a theory common in Northwestern Europe, Northern Europe, North America, Australia, Nazi Germany and Germanic Europe which categorized Mediterranean people as inferior to Nordic or Northwestern European people.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an <b>autonomous</b> <b>stock</b> trading agent designed {{based on the}} classical reinforcement learning algorithm Sarsa λ [1]. The Sarsa based agent, named Sarsa-trader, is compared with an agent with a successful hand coded strategy known as the Reverse Strategy [4] using a simulated stock market. Experimental results on the simulated stock market show that Sarsa-trader outperforms the hand coded agent under several different market conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper explores ways of {{predicting}} prices of securities in financial markets and methods that can autonomously manage these securities. The {{first part of}} this paper focuses on signals and indicators which we can use to predict price movements. The second part focuses on making trading decisions based on available indicators. Together they form a fully <b>autonomous</b> system for <b>stock</b> market trading...|$|R
40|$|If {{services}} providing real-time {{information are}} accessible from mobile devices, functionality is often restricted and no {{adaptation of the}} user interface to the mobile device is attempted. Mobile access to real-time information requires designs for multi-device access and automated facilities for adaptation of user interfaces. We present TapBroker, a push update service that provides mobile and stationary access to information on <b>autonomous</b> agents trading <b>stocks.</b> TapBroker is developed for the Ubiquitous Interactor system and is accessible from Java Swing user interfaces and Web user interfaces on desktop computers, and from a Java Awt user interface on mobile phones. New user interfaces can easily be added without changes in the service logic. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer introducing {{a new product}} into a distribution channel and examine what wholesale price should be charged. The setting in many ways is simple. The channel is abbreviated with the manufacturer selling directly to the retailer. The contract is also simple, merely a flat wholesale price. Demand is stochastic but independent and identically distributed in each period. Complications arise from two additional assumptions. First, neither party knows some parameter of the demand distribution. The system evolves informationally as the channel has more experience with, and information about, the product. Second, we assume unmet demand is both lost and unobserved, so only sales data are available. The <b>autonomous</b> retailer’s <b>stocking</b> level consequently dictates {{the rate at which}} the channel acquires information. The manufacturer’s pricing policy, in turn, influences the retailer’s actions. We explore how the wholesale price evolves as beliefs are updated in a Bayesian fashion. Pricing is driven by the precision of information and not the size of the market. In particular, we show that the manufacturer charges a lower price following a stockout than after an exact observation. That is, she prices more aggressively following a signal of relatively weak deman...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the development of}} an <b>autonomous</b> <b>stock</b> trading agent {{within the framework of the}} Penn-Lehman Automated Trading (PLAT) simulator. The three approaches presented take inspiration from reinforcement learning, myopic trading using regression-based price prediction, and market making. The performance of these approaches is assessed separately using a fixed opponent strategy, SOBI. Controlled experiments are described that isolate the effects of individual parameters of each strategy. Finally, a comparative analysis of the strategies is presented and suggestions are discussed for future work. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ― The general {{perceptions}} about a product and {{the reputation of}} the company determine to a great extent how well the product sells. It is thus imperative that we make efforts to understand the public opinions and sentiments, as they can be a very good indicator of the product’s future sales performance. In this paper, we explore the two most common online media which have been used by the public to express such type of subjective content: Blogs and Micro-blogs. We perform a comparative analysis of the predictive power of the two media to know which of these formats can prove to be a more useful representative of sentiments to an <b>autonomous</b> <b>stock</b> price prediction system...|$|E
40|$|<b>Autonomous</b> {{trading in}} <b>stock</b> markets {{is an area}} of great {{interest}} in both academic and commercial circles. A lot of trading strategies have been proposed and practiced from the perspectives of Artificial Intelligence, market making, external data indication, technical analysis, etc. This paper examines some properties of a counter-intuitive automated stock-trading strategy {{in the context of the}} Penn-Lehman Automated Trading (PLAT) simulator [1], which is a realtime, real-data market simulator. While it might seem natural to buy when the market is on the rise and sell when it is on the decline, our strategy does exactly the opposite. As a result, we call it the reverse strategy. The reverse strategy was the winner strategy in the first and second PLAT live competitions. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the reverse strategy. Also, we suggest ways to control the risk of using the reverse strategy in certain kinds of markets. 1...|$|R
