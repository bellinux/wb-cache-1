2500|$|Chambers' {{attorney}} {{claimed that}} Chambers was used [...] "as a pawn {{in a struggle}} over control and adult businesses." [...] Chambers' arrest came {{three days before the}} Board of Supervisors were to vote on a proposed ordinance to eliminate police permits for adult bookstores and theaters. In the wake of her arrest, the Board stripped police of their power to license the city's adult theaters. [...] "The O'Farrell was packed the day <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> arrested," [...] Chambers said later. [...] "And they put the mayor's phone number up on the marquee -- 'Call Mayor Dianne Feinstein'...I'm in jail with my fur coat and nothing else on, and [...] want to take pictures. I took a mug shot with every cop in the place, and they're going, 'I'm really sorry we had to do this.' And the next night they were all back enjoying the show".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
6000|$|... "If that isn't like you!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "Your {{very first}} words <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> left alone! It brings back the East, Carley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can leave}} {{directions}} to forward {{it if it}} comes <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gone. The post-office authorities will willingly send the letter wherever you direct." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily. [Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate {{entanglement}} my dear boy {{may have}} got into, I will never reproach him with it <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> married.|$|R
60|$|TREHERNE. Man alive, {{you told}} me all about it soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wrecked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber,' was my aunt's first salutation <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> seated. 'Pray, {{have you}} thought about that {{emigration}} proposal of mine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How stupid of you! I {{was asking}} you {{what sort of}} wall-paper you would like in your den <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> married and settled down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, let us get off at once!” exclaimed Dave. “If {{he sends}} word <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gone, {{it can be}} {{forwarded}} to us.” And so it was arranged.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a good fight," [...] said Erling. [...] "Men will talk of it in days to come, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> far away in the world of spirits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us keep {{behind them}} and out of sight," [...] {{suggested}} Giant. [...] "If they see us they may follow us up and damage our boat <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gone." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{came home}} to me, however, {{about an hour and}} a half <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> home, to my great delectation. Our {{visitors}} dined with us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tonald," [...] said Dougall, {{sitting down}} and {{lighting}} his pipe <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> gone, [...] "I wass vera near givin' Muster Lumley a cood threshin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some strong spirit must go with you, Lord Macumazana," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you should}} live today, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{sure that you}} had been slain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{keep the}} story until <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on the way," [...] cried Dave, gayly. [...] "We'll {{have plenty of}} time on the train. It's a four-days' trip to Yellowstone Park, remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the journey}} to the {{mainland}} won't last forever--that's one satisfaction, Tom. I reckon the tub is good for {{that much of a}} run. I don't care what becomes of her <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you not heard?" [...] she said. [...] "I thought, perhaps, that Mr. Andrew {{might have}} told you. Cecil and I are sailing to-morrow, {{directly}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> married. He has bought a farm out there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have not}} touched it since two days <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wrecked, sir; {{but on the}} whole we have not done at all badly with regard to food.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} I did, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> left {{together}} alone, {{was to make}} a third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not again. I {{was married}} {{eighteen}} {{years ago in}} Russia. My husband was transported to Siberia a few days <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> married, and I have never seen him since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What we can," [...] {{answered}} Wulf. [...] "It matters {{little if}} Rosamund is spared by the waters, for they will scarcely take her now, who must loose {{the boat and}} man it <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By attacking {{that with}} the {{heaviest}} sticks of cordwood after the brute <b>is</b> killed, <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> able to pound our way through in a very few seconds. Now come on, and work lively <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in the yard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said quickly. [...] "Please {{forget what}} that remark implied. I {{promise you that}} I will not offend again, if it does offend you, until <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> both safely out of this mess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard {{a frightened}} jay flutter {{among the trees}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> past it. Then ten minutes later I heard the same thing. I knew then {{that there was some}} one on our trail, and I listened." ...|$|E
60|$|As Mary Warren {{saw that}} her friend was serious she changed the subject; soon <b>after,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> set down at Mr. Monson's door. Here the friends parted, Mary Warren preferring to walk home, while Julia and I entered the house together.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{say what}} I mean," [...] I replied. [...] "Before I {{knew what you}} told me about your brother, I was going to propose to you, for your sake and for his, that he should live with us <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> married." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD BROCKLEHURST. Do! I {{hope you}} are ashamed of yourself, mother. (To CRICHTON, who is going). You are an {{excellent}} fellow, Crichton; and if, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "But how <b>are</b> <b>we</b> {{to get in}} again, Tom? I {{expect that}} he does not come back till half-past nine or ten. We can slip out easily enough <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{supposed}} to have gone to bed; but how <b>are</b> <b>we</b> to get back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Indians called these falls [...] "thundering water," [...] {{and it was}} {{an admirable}} title. The waters thunder over the great precipice, as they have done for {{thousands}} of years before <b>we</b> <b>were</b> born, {{and will continue to do}} thousands of years <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dead.|$|R
60|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at supper in the kitchen, {{with its}} low, dark, raftered ceiling from which {{substantial}} hams and flitches of bacon were hanging. Everything {{was just as}} father had described it. We felt that we had come home, leaving exile behind us.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> got {{well into}} the town, we found {{ourselves}} part of an immense bicycle parade, with bicyclers of both sexes on their wheels, in masks and costumes, Pierrots, and Clowns, and Harlequins and Columbines, in a competition for the prettiest and fanciest dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} will go to sea again, as soon as your ship can be got ready, cousin Miles," [...] he commenced, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> left with the fruit and wine. [...] "These are {{stirring}} times in commerce, and the idle man misses golden opportunities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will teach}} you how to use some of them, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on board ship. There will be many days when you boys will have little to do, and it will be an {{excellent}} opportunity to improve your minds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{your men}} {{to free the}} white man <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gone. He can never catch us. That is all I ask of you. If you will grant him his freedom and his life, I will go willingly with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so last, Miss Lucy, if you please. Your {{father will}} not know a {{syllable}} of the matter until you tell him all about it, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gone. <b>We</b> intend 'to relieve him from all responsibility in the premises.'" ...|$|R
