5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts. <b>Analyses</b> using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state of}} constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic <b>analyses</b> often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic <b>analyses</b> of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their <b>analyses</b> suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. B.oligantha resolves as sister taxon (that is, next closest relative) to B.ilicifolia, and B.cuneata resolves as sister to these two. This suggests a monophyletic B. subg. Isostylis; yet the clade appears fairly derived (that it, it evolved relatively recently), implying that B.subgenus Isostylis may not merit subgeneric rank.|$|E

An Eocene fossil cone named Banksia archaeocarpa, around 50 million years old, resembles that of B.attenuata.|$|E
