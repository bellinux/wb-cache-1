40|$|As an ex-honors program/college CEO, the {{question}} raised by this Forum— ”What is <b>an</b> <b>Honors</b> (fill in the blank) ?”—got me reminiscing {{about the old}} days. In some sense the best answers are the obviously circular answers. An <b>honors</b> student is <b>a</b> student participating in <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> program. An honors curriculum is the curriculum required to graduate with honors and is made up, obviously, of honors courses. The people teaching those courses are by necessity honors faculty. But how can <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> course be identified? Well, it is one populated by honors students that meets some curricular requirement of <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> program and is taught by <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> faculty member...|$|R

Can <b>honors</b> administrators create <b>an</b> “honors culture”? Probably not, even in the case of <b>a</b> newly created <b>honors</b> program. The larger institutional culture and the particular characteristics of the first honors students make the creation ex nihilo of <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> culture difficult, if not impossible. But the stated goals of <b>a</b> particular <b>honors</b> program and the attitudes of honors administrators certainly {{play a crucial role in}} the development of the honors culture. When those goals and attitudes are enshrined in the admissions process, curricular requirements, and co-curricular activities of <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> program, honors administrators may enjoy a decisive role in the evolution of <b>an</b> institution’s particular <b>honors</b> culture...|$|R
