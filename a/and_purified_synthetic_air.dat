40|$|For the {{calibration}} of gas chromatographic {{measurements of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} in ambient air samples, standard gas mixtures at low concentrations are needed with high accuracy. For this purpose we developed a diffusion device combined with a dynamic dilution system. Pure liquid compounds are placed in glass vials. They diffuse through a capillary {{on top of each}} vial into a diffusion chamber flushed with <b>synthetic</b> <b>air.</b> In an additional dynamic dilution step the final concentration is adjusted with a flow of <b>purified</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> to typical mixing ratios between several ppt (v/v) and ppb (v/v). The diffusion rates are determined from the mass loss of the vials. Extensive tests over 21 months showed that the diffusion rates varied little with time, between 1. 4 % and 3. 1 %, depending on the compound. The system proved to be suitable for compounds {{with a wide range of}} boiling points, from 305 K (1, 1 -dichlorethene) to 418 K (1, 2 -dimethylbenzene) The diffusion device was applied to a gas chromatographic system with a flame ionization detector and an electron-capture detector. The linearity of the diffusion device was checked with different standard mixtures with mixing ratios ranging from 0. 32 ppt (v/v) (tribromomethane) to 1353 ppt (v/v) (n-pentane). The regression analysis of peak area versus concentration showed excellent agreement among the standards for each compound with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between 0. 9826 and 0. 9998. The temporal stability of the diffusion device was determined from more than 270 measurements of one standard mixture. The reproducibility of the peak areas ranged between 2. 2 % and 12. 7 % depending on the compound. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have demonstrated}} that Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs) are able to form complexes with the extracellular matrix protein Vitronectin (VN). These complexes of VN:IGFBP:IGF-I significantly enhance the proliferation and migration of various cell lines including skin and corneal epithelial cells, as well as primary cells derived from human skin and corneal tissue. These enhanced effects arise from co- activation of the IGF-binding type- 1 IGF receptor (IGF- 1 R) as well as activation of the VN-binding αv-integrins. Further studies suggest that these complexes can replace the requirement for serum in the ex vivo expansion of cells. In order to translate the VN:IGFBP:IGF-I technology into techniques for the improved culture of cells, we have designed, expressed <b>and</b> <b>purified</b> <b>synthetic</b> chimeric molecules, consisting of various domains of VN and mature IGF-I, using a baculovirus based expression system. The recombinant VN:IGF-I (rVN:IGF-I) chimeras were secreted into conditioned media of transfected Sf 9 insect cells. Purification of the chimeras was achieved via methods including heparin-sepharose chromatography, Q-sepharose ion-exchange chromatography and Ni 2 +-NTA affinity chromatography. The rVN:IGF-I chimeras were detectable by Western blot analysis using a poly-clonal anti-VN antibody. Functional characterisation studies indicate that the chimeras promote cellular growth and migration to a similar extent as the VN:IGFBP:IGF-I complexes at 10 x and 30 x molar ratios. Additionally, function blocking antibodies directed to the IGF- 1 R and the VN binding αv-integrin were able to abolish this effect indicating that co-activation of these receptors {{is critical to the}} migratory effect of the chimeras. A functional chimera may lead to the development of cell culture techniques and methodologies that are devoid of xenogeneic or allogeneic support systems, thus paving the way to approved tissue engineering therapeutics that incorporate ex vivo expanded adult stem and progenitor cells...|$|R

40|$|Vascular calcification, which {{contributes}} to cardiovascular disease {{in patients with}} uremic hyperphosphatemia, is associated with vascular cell expression of osteogenic genes, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 2 and osteopontin (OPN). High inorganic phosphate levels in vitro stimulate the osteogenic conversion of smooth muscle cells; however, the mechanism governing this is not clear. We found that high-phosphate medium increased the expression of BMP- 2 and OPN in mouse smooth muscle cells in culture. However, this effect {{was lost in the}} presence of the mineralization inhibitor, pyrophosphate, suggesting a contribution of calcium phosphate crystals. Addition of 1 – 2 [*]mmol/l phosphate alone to growth medium was sufficient to induce nanosized crystals after 1 day at 37 [*]°C.

The {{sensitivity of the}} assay was 0 =. ng rat calcitonin/ml plasma.

The level of calcitonin in the plasma after 17 =. days of gestation was already higher than that in the control rats, it increased further up to 19 =. days and decreased at 21 =. days. Infusion of calcium into pregnant rats for 1 h after 21 =. days of gestation induced a sixfold increase in the level of calcitonin in the plasma after 30 min, and a threefold increase after 1 h. The level of calcitonin in the plasma of fed and unfed newborn rats was measured 2, 6, 12 and 16 h after birth. At each stage, the concentration of calcitonin was higher in fed than in unfed animals. Stomach gavage of fat (triglycerides) in fasted rats born 2 h earlier stimu-lated secretion of calcitonin; administration of pentagastrin or glucagon had no effect on the level of calcitonin in the plasma. Subcutaneous injection of a calcium load to fasted newborn rats (2 hours old) increased the level of calcitonin in the plasma after 30 min. These results demonstrate that during gestation calcitonin has a comparable role in rats to that already found in ruminants.

5000|$|In situ {{leaching}} (ISL), {{a widespread}} technique used to mine uranium, is {{implicated in the}} artificial increase of uranium sulfate compounds. ISL was {{the most widely used}} method to mine uranium in the United States during the 1990s. The method involves pumping an extraction liquid (either sulfuric acid or an alkaline carbonate solution) into an ore deposit, where it complexes with the uranium, then removing the liquid <b>and</b> <b>purifying</b> the uranium.This <b>synthetic</b> addition of sulfuric acid unnaturally raises the abundance of uranium sulfate complexes at the site. The lower pH caused by the introduction of acid increases the solubility of U(IV), which is typically relatively insoluble and precipitates out of solution at neutral pH.While oxidation states for uranium range from U3+ to U6+, U(III) and U(V) are rarely found, and U(VI) and U(IV) predominate. U(VI) forms stable aqueous complexes and is thus fairly mobile. Preventing the spread of toxic uranium compounds from mining sites often involves reduction of U(VI) to the far less soluble U(IV). The presence of sulfuric acid and sulfates prevents this sequestration, however, by both lowering the pH and through the formation of uranium salts. U(SO4)2 [...] is soluble in water, and thus far more mobile. Uranium sulfate complexes also form quite readily.|$|R

Our preceding inquiries (1, 2), using a "natural " disease in a "natural " host, Salmonella infection in Mus musculus, demonstrated that there were two necessary conditions which had to be fulfilled in the laboratory set-up employed before the outcome of an infection could be measurably influenced by diet. These conditions were (a) genetic heterogeneity in the host genotype (1), and (b) an array of variation, in terms of virulence, among the pathogen population introduced (2). Given these conditions more infected animals survived on a diet of natural foodstuffs, whole wheat, and whole dried milk, than on an otherwise nutritionally adequate diet composed of <b>purified</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthetic</b> materials, a so called "synthetic " diet (1, 2).

40|$|Peroxisomes are {{metabolic}} organelles {{found in}} almost all eukaryotic organisms. As peroxisomes possess no DNA, the matrix protein content required for function is post-translationally imported from the cytosol via one of two peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS). The PTSl and PTS 2 are recognised by the cytosolic receptors PEX 5 and PEX 7, respectively, PEX 5 also functions as a coreceptor for PTS 2 import. The cytosolic import complex then docks at PEX 14 and PEX 13 at the peroxisomal membrane for import. To gain insight into the interactions involved in formation of the docking complex representative soluble protein constructs of PTS 1 and PTS 2 cargo, PEX 5, PEX 7 and PEX 14 were expressed <b>and</b> <b>purified.</b> Additionally, <b>synthetic</b> peptides representative of the key interaction motifs were obtained. These tools were utilised in biochemical and biophysical assays to generate both quantitative and qualitative data for modelling of interaction steps. A new approach for labelling of binding partners in solution through Enzyme Mediated Activation of Radical Sources was also investigated. A low affinity interaction was detected between PEX 14 and peptide motifs from PEX 5, and it was shown that binding of PTSl cargo to PEX 5 was not a prerequisite for interaction with PEX 14. The PEX 5 receptor was also shown {{to be capable of}} forming a complex with both PTS 1 and PEX 7 -PTS 2 cargos simultaneously, thus representing a point of convergence of the two pathways in A. thafiana. Recent studies have implicated PEX 14 in release of catalase, an atypical PTS 1 cargo, from PEX 5. In a range of biophysical and biochemical assays, PEX 14 dependent PTSl cargo release was not observed. However, a new function of PEX 14, PEX 14 dependent release of PTS 2 cargo from the PEX 7 - PEX 5 complex was observed. This demonstrates the docking complex to be the point of PTS 2 cargo-unloading, and opens the possibility that interplay with PEX 13 may be required for PTSl cargo-unloading.

40|$|Hopanoids are steroid-like lipids {{from the}} isoprenoid family that are {{produced}} primarily by bacteria. Hopanes, molecular fossils of hopanoids, offer {{the potential to}} provide insight into environmental transitions on the early Earth, if their sources and biological functions can be constrained. Semiquantitative methods for mass spectrometric analysis of hopanoids from cultures and environmental samples have been developed {{in the last two}} decades. However, the structural diversity of hopanoids, and possible variability in their ionization efficiencies on different instruments, have thus far precluded robust quantification and hindered comparison of results between laboratories. These ionization inconsistencies give rise to the need to calibrate individual instruments with purified hopanoids to reliably quantify hopanoids. Here, we present new approaches to obtain both <b>purified</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthetic</b> quantification standards. We optimized 2 -methylhopanoid production in Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE- 1 <b>and</b> <b>purified</b> 2 Me-diplopterol, 2 Me-bacteriohopanetetrol (2 Me-BHT), and their unmethylated species (diplopterol and BHT). We found that 2 -methylation decreases the signal intensity of diplopterol between 2 and 34 % depending on the instrument used to detect it, but decreases the BHT signal less than 5 %. In addition, 2 Me-diplopterol produces 10 × higher ion counts than equivalent quantities of 2 Me-BHT. Similar deviations were also observed using a flame ionization detector for signal quantification in GC. In LC-MS, however, 2 Me-BHT produces 11 × higher ion counts than 2 Me-diplopterol but only 1. 2 × higher ion counts than the sterol standard pregnane acetate. To further improve quantification, we synthesized tetradeuterated (D_ 4) diplopterol, a precursor for a variety of hopanoids. LC-MS analysis on a mixture of (D 4) -diplopterol and phospholipids showed that under the influence of co-eluted phospholipids, the D_ 4 -diplopterol internal standard quantifies diplopterol more accurately than external diplopterol standards. These new quantitative approaches permit meaningful comparisons between studies, allowing more accurate hopanoid pattern detection in both laboratory and environmental samples...|$|R

40|$|Molecular chaperones are {{required}} for the correct folding and assembly of certain other polypeptides. It is not known whether molecular chaperones themselves require other chaperones to become functional. A 97 -amino acid chaperone, the chaperonin 10 protein was chemically synthesised so that during synthesis and purification there was no contact of the chaperone with any other protein. The <b>purified,</b> <b>synthetic</b> chaperonin 10 protein formed oligomeric structures spontaneously and was biologically active as a chaperonin. This is the first description of a chemically synthesised chaperonin, and suggests that no other chaperones {{are required}} for correct folding, polymerisation and biological activity of this chaperone...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach was}} {{established for the}} validation of an in vitro test system for complex environmental test atmospheres consisting of both gaseous substances and particulates. Smoke from two different cigarette types (generated by an automatic cigarette-smoking machine) was employed to assess both the sensitivity and the specificity of the system. The smoke was diluted with <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> and used to expose human lung cells grown on microporous membranes. Cells were exposed alternately to diluted cigarette smoke and pure <b>synthetic</b> <b>air.</b> The effect of diluted smoke was assessed without humidification, addition of CO(2), or any other physical or chemical modification of the smoke. The experimental setup included online monitoring of the gas phase (by analysis of CO concentration) and particulate phase (by light-scattering photometry). Replicate experiments confirmed a reproducible generation and dilution of the smoke and a smoke age of about 7 s {{at the time it}} came into contact with the cells. Experiments using human lung cells revealed that smoke from the two different cigarette types induced different levels of dose-dependent toxicity. A cell exposure of 6 min using 6 alternating smoke and <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> periods was sufficient to cause different effects as measured by intracellular glutathione content. The fact that the system could differentiate between two different types of cigarette smoke demonstrated its high sensitivity and specificity. The system offers new ways to test native complex gaseous and aerosol mixtures in vitro using short exposure times and very small amounts of test substances...|$|R

The discharge was initiated by a train of 30 ns FWHM pulses of alternating positivenegativepositive polarity, separated by 250 ns, with a train repetition frequency of 10 Hz. The amplitude of the first pulse was 10 kV in the cable. A flow of <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> through the tube provided complete gas renewal between pulse trains. The O-atom density measurements were made over the time interval 200 ns 2 µ s after the initial pulse. The gas temperature was determined by analysis of the molecular nitrogen second positive system optical emission spectrum. The influence of the gas temperature on the atom density measurements, and the reactions producing O atoms, are discussed...|$|R

Isothermal oxidation {{tests were}} carried out at 1050 °C in <b>synthetic</b> <b>air.</b> Cyclic oxidation tests were performed with 2 cycle frequencies :- Short term cycles : 1 h dwells at 1050 °C in <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> × 1800 cycles- Long term cycles : 300 h dwells at 1050 °C in laboratory air × 6 cycles (experiment planned to totalize at least 10 000 hours at high temperature) The mass gain curves point out a large effect of the cycle frequency at 1050 °C for overlay NiCoCrAlYTa coating whereas the effect is less significant for Pt-modified nickel aluminide coating. Scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of cycle frequency on microstructural evolution.

40|$|Cleaner {{and more}} {{efficient}} combustion processes are demanded by the combustion industry due to fuel depletion and air quality issues. A numerical study of a laboratory scale combustor is reported. The numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS Fluent 14. 5. Turbulence was modelled using the realizable k–ε model. The combustion chamber is an open end cylinder with the burner mounted {{at the bottom of}} the combustor. Biogas was used as a fuel with 60 % methane and 40 % carbon dioxide and oxidiser used was atmospheric <b>air</b> and <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> by mixing oxygen and nitrogen. The oxygen dilution ratio was analysed at the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and air supply mixing area. The dilution ratio is 40 % for atmospheric air and a lower ratio when the low-oxygen <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> was used. The temperature throughout the combustion chamber was found to be close to homogeneous. The inlet air velocity did not affect the chamber and EGR temperature. In these simulations, MILD combustion was achieved. ...|$|R
