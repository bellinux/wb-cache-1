No information is communicated between aircraft, and only passive 2 -D vision information is available to maintain formation. The methods for formation control rely either on estimating the range from 2 -D vision information by using Extended Kalman Filters or directly regulating the size of the image subtended by a leader aircraft on the image plane. When the image size is not a reliable measurement, especially at large ranges, we consider the use of bearing-only information.

This report contains the details of LS models for aircraft fuel estimation, the procedure for building the LS models and their utilization to estimate the fuel quantity in the internal fuel tanks of LCA from flight data. Initially a set of LS coefficients has been estimated separately for each FCG (Fuel Capacitance Gauging) probes using individual FCG probe count, <b>aircraft</b> <b>accelerations,</b> <b>aircraft</b> attitudes and the reconstructed fuel content time history (of the fuel tank in which the particular probe is located) from the same flight data. Using the estimated LS coefficients, an algorithm ‘FELS’ (Fuel Estimation by Least Squares technique) has been developed in MATLAB to estimate fuel content in the internal tanks of LCA. The performance of the FELS has been verified with 56 different flight data of PV 2, PV 3, LSP 1 and LSP 2 aircraft (flights without drop tanks) and compared with lookup table based estimates, the technique currently being used on LCA. Few results of fuel quantity estimates by FELS in the internal fuel tanks of LCA/Tejas from flight data (with and without probe failure cases) are presented and discussed in this report. FELS algorithm is computationally simple (consists only multiplication and averaging) compared to the currently used table lookup method.

Decreases in thrust-specific fuel consumption of 1 to 2 percent were measured in the minimum-fuel-flow mode; these fuel savings are significant especially for supersonic cruise aircraft. Decreases of up to approximately 100 R in fan turbine inlet temperature were measured in the minimum-temperature mode.

A system capable of instantaneously determining the stopping distance of an aircraft could form an integral component of a monitoring system.

5000|$|During the {{abnormal}} acceleratory {{environment of}} flight, the vestibular and proprioceptive systems {{do not respond}} truthfully. Because of inertial forces created by <b>acceleration</b> of the <b>aircraft</b> along with centrifugal force caused by turning, the net gravitoinertial force sensed primarily by the otolith organs is not aligned with gravity, leading to perceptual misjudgment of the vertical. In addition, the inner ear contains rotational [...] "accelerometers," [...] known as the semicircular canals, which provide information to the lower brain on rotational accelerations in the pitch, roll and yaw axes. However, prolonged rotation (beyond 15-20 s) results in a cessation of semicircular output, and cessation of rotation thereafter can even result {{in the perception of}} motion in the opposite direction. Under ideal visual conditions the above illusions are unlikely to be perceived, but at night or in poor weather the visual inputs are no longer capable of overriding these illusory nonvisual sensations. In many cases, illusory visual inputs such as a sloping cloud deck can also lead to misjudgments of the vertical and of speed and distance or even combine with the nonvisual ones to produce an even more powerful illusion. The result of these various visual and nonvisual illusions is spatial disorientation.

40|$|In February 1998, a regional-scale, {{airborne}} gravity {{survey was}} carried out over the French Occidental Alps {{within the framework of}} the GéoFrance 3 -D research program. The survey consisted of 18 NS and 16 EW oriented lines with a spacing of 10 and 20 km respectively, covering the whole of the Western French Alps (total area: 50 000 km 2; total distance of lines flown: 10 000 km). The equipment was mounted in a medium-size aircraft (DeHavilland Twin Otter) flowing at a constant altitude of 5100 m a. s. l, and at a mean ground speed of about 280 km h− 1. Gravity was measured using a LaCoste & Romberg relative, air/sea gravimeter (type SA) mounted on a laser gyro stabilized platform. Data from 5 GPS antennae located on fuselage and wings and 7 ground-based GPS reference stations were used to determine position and <b>aircraft</b> induced <b>accelerations.</b> The gravimeter passband was derived by comparing the vertical accelerations provided by the gravimeter with those estimated from the GPS positions. This comparison showed that the gravimeter is not sensitive to very short wavelength <b>aircraft</b> <b>accelerations,</b> and therefore a simplified formulation for computing airborne gravity measurements was developed. The intermediate and short wavelength, non-gravitational accelerations were eliminated by means of digital, exponential low-pass filters (cut-off wavelength: 16 km). An important issue in airborne gravimetry is the reliability of the airborne gravity surveys when compared to ground surveys. In our studied area, the differences between the airborne-acquired Bouguer anomaly and the ground upward-continued Bouguer anomaly of the Alps shows a good agreement: the rms of these differences is equal to 7. 68 mGal for a spatial resolution of 8 km. However, in some areas with rugged topography, the amplitudes of those differences have a striking correlation with the topography. We then argue that the choice of an appropriate density (reduction by a factor of 10 per cent) for computing the ground topographic corrections over the highest mountains, results in significantly reducing the differences between airborne and ground upward-continued Bouguer anomalies, which shows that some of the misfit stems from errors in the ground dat...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated flight dynamic modeling method for flexible aircraft that captures coupled physics effects due to inertial forces, aeroelasticity, and propulsive {{forces that are}} normally present in flight. The present approach formulates the coupled flight dynamics using a structural dynamic modeling method that describes the elasticity of a flexible, twisted, swept wing using an equivalent beam-rod model. The structural dynamic model allows for three types of wing elastic motion: flapwise bending, chordwise bending, and torsion. Inertial force coupling with the wing elasticity is formulated to account for <b>aircraft</b> <b>acceleration.</b> The structural deflections create an effective aeroelastic angle of attack that affects the rigid-body motion of flexible aircraft. The aeroelastic effect contributes to aerodynamic damping forces that can influence aerodynamic stability. For wing-mounted engines, wing flexibility can cause the propulsive forces and moments to couple with the wing elastic motion. The integrated flight dynamics for a flexible aircraft are formulated by including generalized coordinate variables associated with the aeroelastic-propulsive forces and moments in the standard state-space form for six degree-of-freedom flight dynamics.

It is found to be difficult to model the launcher sway braces and hooks which transmit compression only or tension only type forces respectively. A simple, iterative process was developed to overcome this modeling difficulty. A proposed code modification would help model compression or tension only contact type problems...|$|R
40|$|An {{interface}} {{verification test}} (IFVT) in the free-free condition {{was conducted to}} verify that the constrained modes of a mass simulator had the same frequencies as the Hubble Space Telescope, {{for which it was}} designed. Landing tests were performed in which the mass simulator was mounted on its trunnions inside a container onboard an <b>aircraft.</b> Its <b>acceleration</b> response was adequately measured, and the anticipated constrained natural frequencies based on the IFVT were confirmed. The first test updated the model to predict the fixed based modes, and the second verified the test's capacity to characterize the structure. The IFVT is shown to generate information which permits accurate modeling of the constrained structure, without requiring the traditional fixed-based modal test...|$|R
