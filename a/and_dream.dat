5|$|Jayasudha's {{efforts to}} remake this film in Hindi with Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan were unsuccessful.

5|$|The {{scenes were}} {{primarily}} shot in Quiapo, Manila, church scenes {{were recorded in}} Iguig <b>and</b> <b>dream</b> sequences in Currimao, Ilocos Norte. Guillen noted the stress of recording in Quiapo, due to {{the large number of}} extras, the already crowded nature of the area and the small size of the time periods during which they were allowed to film in the church itself.|$|E

5|$|Wally Pfister {{gave each}} {{location}} <b>and</b> <b>dream</b> level a distinctive look {{to aid the}} audience's recognition of the narrative's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and the scenes in the van are more neutral.|$|E
5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, <b>and</b> <b>dream</b> of being princesses. They contrast {{their lives to}} Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, <b>and</b> <b>Dream</b> Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist {{and their}} friend, Eric Sparrow, live in {{suburban}} New Jersey <b>and</b> <b>dream</b> of becoming famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting {{town for a}} demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that {{a good way to}} start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.|$|E
5|$|Gummi Ships {{are another}} common {{element of the}} series, which serve as the main mode of {{transportation}} between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title. Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu. This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler. In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep <b>and</b> <b>Dream</b> Drop Distance, the main characters write their own journal entries.|$|E
5|$|James IV's (r. 1488–1513) {{creation}} of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets. These court poets, or makars, who were mainly clerics included Robert Henryson (c. 1450-c. 1505), who re-worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The Morall Fabillis. William Dunbar (1460–1513) produced satires, lyrics, invectives <b>and</b> <b>dream</b> visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. Gavin Douglas (1475–1522), who became Bishop of Dunkeld, injected humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados. It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden that brought the reign to an end.|$|E

5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, <b>and</b> <b>dream</b> cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{appeared}} in each issue of ESPN the Magazine, with his Holla column. During {{his work at}} ESPN, he also interviewed Tiger Woods, Sammy Sosa, President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. As {{a part of the}} interview with President Barack Obama, Scott played in a one-on-one basketball game with the President. In 2004, per the request of U.S. troops, Scott and fellow SportsCenter co-anchors hosted a week of programs originating from Kuwait for ESPN's SportsCenter: Salute the Troops. He hosted a number of ESPN game and reality shows, including Stump the Schwab, Teammates, <b>and</b> <b>Dream</b> Job, and hosted David Blaine's Drowned Alive special. He hosted a special and only broadcast episode of America's Funniest Home Videos called AFV: The Sports Edition.|$|E
5|$|Extramusical {{connotations of}} this kind have {{sometimes}} {{been used as a}} basis {{for the construction of a}} psychological or biographical narrative, attempting to interpret the musical program behind Schubert's last sonatas. Charles Fisk has suggested that the sonatas portray a protagonist going through successive stages of alienation, banishment, exile, and eventual homecoming (in the A major and B-flat Sonatas), or self-assertion (in the C minor Sonata). Discrete tonalities or tonal strata, appearing in complete musical segregation from one another at the beginning of each sonata, suggest contrasting psychological states, such as reality <b>and</b> <b>dream,</b> home and exile, etc.; these conflicts are further deepened in the ensuing slow movements. Once these contrasts are resolved at the finale, by intensive musical integration and the gradual transition from one tonality to the next, a sense of reconciliation, of acceptance and homecoming, is invoked. Fisk's hypothetical narrative is grounded on the basis of the ample cyclic connections within the sonatas and their unique tonal design, as well as their musical similarities to songs such as Der Wanderer and the Winterreise song cycle; and on biographical evidence concerning Schubert's life, including a story written by Schubert (Mein Traum – My Dream). Fisk suggests that the sonatas convey Schubert's own feelings of loneliness and alienation; by their striving towards musical and tonal integration, the writing of these works offered Schubert a release from his emotional distress, particularly deepened after finishing the composition of the lonely, depressive and hopeless songs of Winterreise, during the preceding year.|$|E

5|$|In {{the credits}} of HD 1.5 Remix, clips of Kingdom Hearts Re:coded were shown, hinting at its {{inclusion}} in another collection. On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced that Re:coded {{would be part}} of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection, released exclusively on the PlayStation 3. Due to the games touch screen use on the Nintendo DS, console conversion was ruled out as it would necessitate a full remake. Two additional hours of cinematics were created for the game to cover the entire story and show the games connections to other Kingdom Hearts titles. The collection features the game as HD cinematics, much like 358/2 Days was in the HD 1.5 Remix collection. The collection also includes both Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix in HD and trophy support. Additional events occur in the cinematic scenes not seen in the original, with new voice acting, orchestrated audio, and including new battle scenes and a scene that ties Re:coded <b>and</b> <b>Dream</b> Drop Distance together. The collection was released in Japan on October 2, 2014, North America on December 2, 2014, Australia on December 4, 2014, and Europe on December 5, 2014.|$|E
