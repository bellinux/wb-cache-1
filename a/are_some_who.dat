5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E

25|$|Wajib As-salat are compulsory, {{non-performance}} {{of which}} renders one a sinner. However, {{the evidence of}} the obligation is open to interpretation, with some of the madhab saying it is obligatory while others saying it is optional. To deny that a fard salah is obligatory is an act of disbelief while denying the obligation of a wajib salat is not disbelief.

Considered a stubborn bureaucracy and slow to change, USDA is also perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{year of the}} buildings' construction, {{as well as the}} {{architect}} responsible are subject to some debate. The architects generally credited with Colonnade Row's design is Alexander Jackson Davis, Ithiel Town, and James Dakin, who were believed to have designed the homes for the Astor and Vanderbilt families. Town and Dakin are believed to have begun work on the project, which they called LaGrange Terrace, during the winter of 1831–32, during which they worked on a number of design projects. Davis is not believed to {{have played a role in}} the final construction of the building, which was completed in 1833 according to the Landmarks Commission, and there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> believe that he did not work on the design at all.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Charter {{has little}} to say, {{explicitly}} at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant. The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment. Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.|$|E
500|$|Although the flitch {{ceremony}} at Dunmow is generally held to have originated with the Fitzwalters in the 13th century there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> would date it to earlier Norman or Saxon times, one suggested date being 1104, {{the founding of}} the Little Dunmow Priory. [...] This is partly because the flitch of Dunmow seems to have already been common knowledge in very early works such as the prologue to Chaucer's [...] "Wife of Bath" [...] and also in the Visions of Pierce Plowman by William Langland. [...] Some would also read passages in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as alluding to the Dunmow flitch.|$|E
500|$|Black also {{tended to}} favor law and order over civil rights activism. This led him to read the Civil Rights Act narrowly. For example, he dissented in a case {{reversing}} convictions of sit-in protesters, arguing to limit {{the scope of the}} Civil Rights Act. In 1968 he said, “Unfortunately there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> think that Negroes should have special privileges under the law.” Black felt that actions like protesting, singing, or marching for [...] "good causes" [...] one day could lead to supporting evil causes later on; his sister-in-law explained that Black was [...] "mortally afraid" [...] of protesters. Black opposed the actions of some civil rights and Vietnam War protesters and believed that legislatures first, and courts second, should be responsible for alleviating social wrongs. Black once said he was [...] "vigorously opposed to efforts to extend the First Amendment's freedom of speech beyond speech," [...] to conduct.|$|E

We have a daughter of as fine proportions and of as angelic mien as ever gracious nature favor a man with, and her name is Ima!" [...] Ima Hogg had no middle name, which was unusual for the time. Her first name was taken from her uncle Thomas Hogg's epic Civil War poem The Fate of Marvin, which featured two young women named Ima and Leila. [...] According to Virginia Bernhard's biography of Ima Hogg, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> believe that James Stephen Hogg … named his only daughter Ima Hogg {{to attract the attention of}} Texas voters" [...] in a year when he was running in a close race for district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas, which he won. Alternatively, correspondence from Jim Hogg indicates he may not have been conscious of the combined effect of his daughter's first and last names.|$|E
500|$|Several {{writers and}} sports personalities {{consider}} this Sewanee team {{one of the}} greatest football teams ever to play. Former Penn State coach Joe Paterno once said: [...] "While there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> would swear to the contrary, I did not see the 1899 Sewanee football team play in person. Winning five road games in six days, all by shutout scores, has {{to be one of the}} most staggering achievements in the history of the sport. If the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) had been in effect in 1899, there seems little doubt Sewanee would have played in the title game. And they wouldn’t have been done in by any computer ratings." [...] Tony Barnhart in Southern Fried Football: The History, Passion and Glory of the Great Southern Game listed Sewanee as his number 1 Southern football team of all-time. A 16-team playoff to determine the best team in college football history with winners decided by fan votes was run by the College Football Hall of Fame, called the March of the Gridiron Champions. Sewanee, starting at the lowest seed, won the tournament.|$|E
500|$|In Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, Egypt {{is covered}} only in passing. When Eusebius {{remarks on the}} region, however, he writes of tens, twenties, even {{hundreds}} of Christians put to death on a single day, which would seem to make Egypt the region that suffered the most during the persecutions. According to one report that Barnes calls [...] "plausible, if unverifiable", 660 Christians were killed in Alexandria alone between 303 and 311. In Egypt, Peter of Alexandria fled his namesake city {{early on in the}} persecution, leaving the Church leaderless. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis (Asyut), took up the job in his place. Meletius performed ordinations without Peter's permission, which caused some bishops to complain to Peter. Meletius soon refused to treat Peter as any kind of authority, and expanded his operations into Alexandria. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the Church split into two sections: the [...] "Catholic Church", under Peter, and, after Peter's execution, Alexander; and the [...] "Church of the Martyrs" [...] under Meletius. When the two groups found themselves imprisoned together in Alexandria during the persecution, Peter of Alexandria drew up a curtain {{in the middle of their}} cell. He then said: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> are of my view, let them come over on my side, and those of Melitius's view, stay with Melitius." [...] Thus divided, the two sects went on with their affairs, purposely ignoring each other's existence. The schism continued to grow throughout the persecution, even with its leaders in jail, and would persist long after the deaths of both Peter and Meletius. Fifty-one bishoprics are attested for Egypt in 325; fifteen are only known otherwise as seats of the schismatic Church.|$|E
