The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{students}} from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately {{in their own}} dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, assuming they will be a roommate {{and participate in the}} foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency attitudes are laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes hallways (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors—including mainlanders—of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests {{may or may not be}} allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm. Electricity is usually available at <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the day.|$|E

The area is named [...] "Azarat Yisrael" [...] (or in more proper pronunciation, [...] "Ezrat Yisrael"). After some controversy regarding the question of authority over this prayer area, the announcement was made that it would come under the authority of a future government-appointed [...] "pluralist council" [...] that would include non-Orthodox representatives.|$|E
500|$|Ham Mills was {{a site of}} milling {{activity}} from mediaeval times until about 1914. The mill was situated on {{an island in the}} middle of the river, with a weir and bypass channel to the north and the lock channel to the south. The Conservators were required to light the area after a boatman fell into the river and drowned while attempting to use the lock after dark in March 1826. The coroner who instructed that the lighting should be installed noted that [...] "boats were passing at <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the night." [...] Water levels in the river fell as more water was extracted further upstream, and by the 1890s the waterwheels were assisted by a steam-driven turbine which the miller installed. Milling ceased in 1914, when the boiler which supplied the steam was removed by the War Department, so that it could be fitted into a minesweeper. A surviving mill house which dates from the early 19th century has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.|$|E

500|$|According {{to his own}} estimate, Davidson {{approached}} around 150 to 200 girls a {{year over}} a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to an overall total of between 500 and 1000). His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by [...] "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants at <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the [...] "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was [...] "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".|$|E
500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E
