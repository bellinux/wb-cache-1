5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E

25|$|As President of Bolivia, Santa Cruz instigated several failed plots {{to achieve}} a {{political}} union with Peru, taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> country's chronic political unrest. His best opportunity came in 1835 when the Peruvian President Luis José de Orbegoso requested his assistance to fight the rebel army of Felipe Santiago Salaverry. Santa Cruz defeated Peruvian caudillo Agustín Gamarra at the Battle of Yanacocha (August 13, 1835) and Salaverry at the Battle of Uchumayo (February 4, 1836) after which he had Salaverry summarily executed.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the French Masséna {{failed to}} take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> chance. Crucially, in the two days bought by Ney, Masséna had not {{attempted}} a coup de main against Coimbra, even though Trant's rather weak garrison had orders to retire immediately if strongly pressed. At the end of 12 March the French were still {{to the south of}} the river, and in danger of being trapped by Wellington. The only alternative route open to Masséna was to retreat east towards the Spanish border, and the only road available led east from Condeixa. With the British close to that village, on the morning of 13 March Masséna began the long costly retreat back into Spain which marked the complete failure of his great invasion of Portugal.|$|E

25|$|In its 1978 Marquette Bank decision, {{the court}} had {{unanimously}} held that the National Banking Act of 1863, which created nationally-chartered banks {{in addition to the}} state ones that had previously existed, barred states from enforcing their anti-usury laws, which set caps on interest rates, against any national bank based in another state. In 1980, Citibank took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> decision and moved its money-losing credit-card operations to South Dakota, after persuading that state's legislature and governor to repeal its anti-usury law. Other states and banks followed the example, and by 1990 the number of credit cards in circulation had doubled, while the average household's revolving balance increased more than fivefold. At the time late fees were bringing in $2 billion annually to the industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1851 Bishop Edward Field {{describes}} Battle Harbour as {{probably the}} oldest, {{as well as}} the largest settlement on the Labrador coast. The men who came and stayed there were generally from the Island of Newfoundland that used to bring with them servants from Dorset. Some of the first permanent residents were fishermen, carpenters and coopers from Poole, Dorset, Fogo Island and New World Island. As the community grew, there became an increasing need for supplies and merchants took full <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> where in some cases local residents paid as much as 100% beyond the regular cash price for goods. The exclusive monopoly was not challenged until 1918, when Battle Harbour's first co-operative was set up, through the initiative of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell.|$|E
25|$|Austin offered Parker the {{opportunity}} to move to Nashville, Tennessee, where music was becoming a big business, but for reasons unknown Parker turned him down. Instead, Parker decided to stay in Temple Terrace, Florida, with his family, perhaps {{to avoid having to}} fill in paperwork that could expose his illegal status. Within a year, he had {{the opportunity}} to become a legal citizen of the United States – a new law allowed illegal aliens the chance to become citizens in return for their promise to fight for the country during World War II, if required. He served in the peacetime army as a precondition for taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> but he never subsequently applied to become a citizen.

25|$|In 1311, Prataparudra {{formed a}} part of the sultanate forces that {{attacked}} the Pandyan empire in the south, and he took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> situation to quell some of his vassals in Nellore who had seen his reduced status as an opportunity for independence. Later, though, in 1318, he failed to provide the annual tribute to Delhi, claiming that the potential for being attacked on the journey made it impossible. Alauddin responded by sending another of his generals, Khusrau Khan, to Orugallu with a force that bristled with technology previously unknown in the area, including trebuchet-like machines. Prataparudra had to submit once more, with his obeisance on this occasion being arranged by the sultanate to include a very public display whereby he bowed towards Delhi from the ramparts of Orugallu. The amount of his annual tribute was changed, becoming 100 elephants and 12,000 horses.|$|E
25|$|Soon thereafter, Li Ji's {{grandson}} Li Jingye, the Duke of Ying, who {{had been}} disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). The rebellion initially drew much popular support in the region, however, Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> popular support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor and argued that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended her, and she {{accused him of being}} complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent a general, Li Xiaoyi (李孝逸), to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant Wei Yuanzhong and eventually was able to crush Li Jingye's forces. Li Jingye fled and was killed in flight.|$|E

500|$|During {{the winter}} of 19751976, Moolin {{pronounced}} himself dissatisfied with progress, but promised improvements. [...] "We've learned an awful lot. This year (1975) was a pull-ourselves-up-by-our-bootstraps operation. We didn't really have our organization set until July, and it wasn't working at top effectiveness until October." [...] To take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> [...] "top effectiveness", Moolin set an ambitious goal for 1976 construction: [...] "We're expecting {{to have all of}} the line installed, insulated, and hydro-tested by November 1," [...] he said in January. That goal was ambitious, because most of the work that had been done to that point was on floodplains and flat terrain. Still left to tackle were difficult construction projects in Atigun Pass and Keystone Canyon. [...] "In some areas, we did eat our cake last year," [...] Moolin said.|$|E
500|$|Like firearms, cannon are a {{descendant}} of the fire-lance, a gunpowder-filled tube used as a flamethrower; [...] was sometimes placed in the barrel {{so that it would}} fly out together with the flames. In due course, the proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to increase its explosive power. To better withstand that explosive power, the paper and bamboo of which fire-lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced by metal. And to take full <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> power, the shrapnel came to be replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more closely. With this, we have the three basic features of the gun: a barrel made of metal, high-nitrate gunpowder, and a projectile which totally occludes the muzzle so that the powder charge exerts its full potential in propellant effect.|$|E
