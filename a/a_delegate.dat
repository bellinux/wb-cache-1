5|$|In 1890, Goebel was <b>a</b> <b>delegate</b> to Kentucky's fourth {{constitutional}} convention, {{which produced}} the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as <b>a</b> <b>delegate,</b> Goebel showed {{little interest in}} participating {{in the process of}} creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.|$|E

William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. <b>A</b> <b>delegate</b> from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
