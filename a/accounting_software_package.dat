40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the Degree of Master of Business of Administration in Information TechnologyABSTRACT The <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> industry in Sri Lanka can be classified into three product market segments, one is the government sector which is backed by department of state accounts under ministry of finance, {{the second is the}} large scale private sector organizations using enterprise solutions, and the third is the large and SME private sector organizations using mass market <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> The private sector is backed by value added resellers of offshore <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> products and domestic software development firms. Our research is focused in the segment of mass market <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> and their usage. The major problem in the segment is although popular <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> are available and being used by various organizations, many organizations are not fully satisfied with the solutions due to various reasons which fall under cither product aspects or service aspects. So there need to be an assessment done on <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> product quality and service quality and find ways to improve customer satisfaction. The goal of the research is to identify the gaps between perceived and excepted customer satisfaction levels of <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> products and services. This is accomplished by developing a conceptual model to measure the customer satisfaction. The resear chvariables measured under product quality assessment are: <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> modules, features, customization capability, and technology. Under the service quality assessment, the five dimensions of popular SERVQUAL methodology (Parasuraman et al. 1988) are measured. Also the service provider image assessment is done b> measuring the service provider background coupled with overall product and servicequalities. Based on this approach recommendations arc made to promote the local <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyse}} how cost {{accounting}} knowledge is mediated {{in a large}} multinational organisation employing a company-wide enterprise resource planning system and off-the-shelf activity based costing software to create a uniform profitability management system within the organisation. Design/methodology/approach – The case analysis is informed by the theoretical notions of dis-and re-embedding of expert knowledge, expert systems and standards. Findings – The results indicate that standardised cost <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> may be useful {{not only because of}} their superior data processing properties and technical efficiency, but also because of their usability in overcoming resistance to change. It is suggested that <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> and some degrees of freedom in the implementation process may actually enhance actors' “blind” commitment to the system and reduce resistance to the new system. Originality/value – It is of interest to researchers and practitioners alike how ready-made <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> may be successfully used in implementing the changes needed in the management accounting systems of large organisations. It is also particularly interesting to find reasons why <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> seem to be so useful in driving these changes.

40|$|Traditionally, {{the success}} of Information Systems (IS) has been studied {{in the context of}} large organisations with a focus on systems that have been {{developed}} inhouse. Most businesses, however, are small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and they have increasingly adopted <b>packaged</b> application <b>software.</b> To evaluate their success we examined two research variables, namely user practices and design features. The evaluation was done by public accountants who deal with SMEs as clients and are most likely to have well-developed opinions on the use of <b>packaged</b> <b>software.</b> In general, they rated small/medium <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> as satisfactory with some notable exceptions. The installation phase of packages is not very well managed. Packages appear to lack a number of important control features which, considering the lack of internal IS expertise in SMEs, could result in malfunctions of their accounting systems. The study identifies better documentation and user education as ways to overcome perceived deficiencies...|$|R

40|$|The {{accounting}} practitioner {{will almost}} inevitably use <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> in their working life. The first {{aim of this}} project was to review {{the extent to which}} such skills are taught as part of HE accounting courses and then propose whether and how such skills should be included in UMS modules as part of the proposed degree in Accountancy in Worcester Business School. The research motivation here was simply to ensure that our curriculum was fit for purpose. A second aim was to review the use of Excel in teaching accounting courses. As with <b>accounting</b> <b>software,</b> the use of Excel or similar spreadsheets {{is part and parcel of}} an accountant’s working life. In addition some seminar activities are based in computer labs and depend on a certain level of expertise in using Excel to solve accounting problems.

The research motivation here was twofold; to give some measure of students’ expertise in Excel for business use and to investigate whether learning outcomes were compromised by the level of expertise...|$|R

50|$|As {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1, phased {{adoption}} has a loop in it. Every department that is to be connected to the system is going through the same process. First based on the previous training sessions security levels are set (see ITIL) In this way every unique user has its own profile which describes, which parts of the system are visible and/or usable to that specific user. Then the document and policies are documented. All processes and procedures are described in process descriptions, can be in paper or on the intranet. Then the actual conversion is depicted. As described in the above text, certain departments and or parts of an organization may be implemented in different time slots. In figure 1 that is depicted by implementing an additional module or even a total product. HRM needs different modules of an ERP system than Finance (module) or Finance may need an additional <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> (Product). Tuning of the system occurs to solve existing problems. After the certain department has been conversed the loop starts over, and another department or user group may be conversed. If all of the departments or organization parts are conversed and the system is totally implemented the system is officially delivered to the organization and the implementation team may be dissolved.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{accounting}} information systems were designed for payroll functions in 1970s. Initially, {{accounting information}} systems were predominantly developed [...] "in-house" [...] as legacy systems. Such solutions were expensive to develop and difficult to maintain. Therefore, many accounting practitioners preferred the manual approach rather than computer-based. Today, {{accounting information systems}} are more commonly sold as prebuilt <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> from large vendors such as Microsoft, Sage Group, SAP AG|SAP and Oracle Corporation|Oracle where it is configured and customized to match the organization’s business processes. Small businesses often use <b>accounting</b> lower costs <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> such as MYOB and Quickbooks. Large organisations would often choose ERP systems. As the need for connectivity and consolidation between other business systems increased, accounting information systems were merged with larger, more centralized systems known as enterprise resource planning (ERP). Before, with separate applications to manage different business functions, organizations had to develop complex interfaces for the systems {{to communicate with each}} other. In ERP, a system such as accounting information system is built as a module integrated into a suite of applications that can include manufacturing, supply chain, human resources. These modules are integrated together and are able to access the same data and execute complex business processes. Today, Cloud-based accounting information systems are increasingly popular for both SMEs and large organisations for lower costs. With adoption of accounting information systems, many businesses have removed low skills, transactional and operational accounting roles.|$|R
