40|$|Abstract For the nonthermal radio {{emission}} of the Galactic Center Arc in situ electron acceleration is imperative. The observed radio spectrum can be modeled by a transport equation for the relativistic electrons which includes particle acceleration by <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> momentum diffusion via scattering by magnetohydrodynamical turbulence and energy losses by synchrotron radiation. The <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be regarded}} as a natural consequence of multiple reconnection events, caused by the interaction between a molecular cloud and the Arc region. The radio spectrum and even the recently detected 150 GHz emission, explicitely originating from the interaction regions of a molecular cloud with the magnetized Arc, can be explained in terms of quasi-monoenergetically distributed relativistic electrons with a typical energy of about 10 GeV accelerated in stochastically distributed magnetic reconnection zones...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a distorted neutron star dipole magnetic field on pulsar pair cascade multiplicity and pair death lines. Using a simple model for a distorted dipole field that produces an offset polar cap (PC), we derive the <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> above the PC in space-charge-limited flow. We find that even a modest azimuthally asymmetric distortion can significantly increase the <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> {{on one side of the}} PC and, combined with a smaller field line radius of curvature, leads to larger pair multiplicity. The death line for producing pairs by curvature radiation moves downward in the P-P-dot diagram, allowing high pair multiplicities in a larger percentage of the radio pulsar population. These results could have important implications for the radio pulsar population, high energy pulsed emission, and the pulsar contribution to cosmic ray positrons...|$|E

Received: date / Accepted: date Abstract Pulsar ”standard model”, that considers a pulsar as a rotating magnetized conducting sphere surrounded by plasma, is generalized {{to the case}} of oscillating star. We developed an algorithm for calculation of the Goldreich-Julian charge density for this case. We consider distortion of the accelerating zone in the polar cap of pulsar by neutron star oscillations. It is shown that for oscillation modes with high harmonic numbers (l, m) changes in the Goldreich-Julian charge density caused by pulsations of neutron star could lead to significant altering of an <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in the polar cap of pulsar.

40|$|For almost 60 years, {{physicists}} {{have used}} strong, large-scale <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> to <b>accelerate</b> charged subatomic particles.

40|$|Abstract: Gamma-ray pulsar {{profiles}} {{are widely}} believed {{to be dominated by}} caustic effects. The caustic pile-up of photons at a preferred pulse phase can be understood in two equivalent ways: either as a result of aberration and retardation effects, or simply as emission from regions where the curvature of electron trajectories in the inertial observer frame is minimum. For the curvature radiation mechanism, the vanishing curvature in the caustic regions can strongly affect the shape of modelled profiles. We calculate this effect for several generic models of gamma-ray emission, considering the impact of extended <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> electron energy distributions and emission region geometry. We find that slot-gap-like models with curvature emission usually do not produce the caustic-dominated profiles.

40|$|Summary form only given. Acceleration of {{particles}} {{driven by the}} interaction of a relativistic laser intensity, having femtosecond duration, with an under-dense plasma can produce plasma wave, {{in the form of}} bubble, delivering several hundred gigavolts per meter <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> [1] and deliver high quality femtosecond-scale electron beams with relatively narrow energy spread [2] and low emittance [3]. We will discuss how the energy spread for such relatively small electron bunch is affected by beam loading in the bubble regime. Electrons that are accelerated in the wakefield also oscillate transversely and emit very bright x-rays and gamma-rays due to a harmonically resonant betatron oscillation [4]. This synchrotron-like radiation occurs in a “wiggler” formed by the electrostatic forces of the plasma wave.

The <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> inside the light-cylinder, is assumed to be negligible, while outside the light-cylinder it rescales with a finite conductivity (σ). In our approach we calculate the corresponding high energy emission by integrating the trajectories of test particles that originate from the stellar surface, taking into account both the <b>accelerating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> components and the radiation reaction forces. First we explore the parameter space assuming different value sets for the stellar magnetic field, stellar period, and conductivity. We show that the general properties of the model are in a good agreement with observed emission characteristics of young γ-ray pulsars, including features of the phase resolved spectra. Second we find model parameters that fit each pulsar belonging to a group of eight bright pulsars that have a published phase-resolved spectrum. The σ values that best describe each of the pulsars in this group show an increase with the spin-down rate (Ė) and a decrease with the pulsar age, expected if pair cascades are providing the magnetospheric conductivity. Finally, we explore the limits of our analysis and suggest future directions for improving such models. Comment: 17 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
