5|$|As of 1965, {{the route}} {{was located in}} eastern Wilkinson and western Amite counties. All of the route was a two-laned paved road. MS 572 began {{at the center of}} Centreville, near a {{railroad}} track. The route then traveled down Park Road until it exited Wilkinson County and entered Amite County. After crossing the county line, MS 572 intersected MS 24 <b>and</b> <b>MS</b> 33, <b>and</b> <b>MS</b> 572 was also branded Lower Centreville Road. Continuing eastward, the route exited Centreville and crossed over Beaver Creek and emerged into the village of Olio. MS 572 left Olio, and ended few miles later at MS 569 at a T-intersection. Lower Centreville Road continued east, concurrent with MS 569. MS 572 was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Amite County, as part of the state highway system.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Highway 572 (MS 572) is {{a former}} state highway in southwestern Mississippi. The route's western {{terminus}} was in Centreville of Wilkinson county. MS 572 traveled east and intersected MS 24 <b>and</b> <b>MS</b> 33, {{just east of the}} town. It ended at MS 569 south of Beechwood. MS 572 was designated in 1957, from MS 24 <b>and</b> <b>MS</b> 33 to MS 569. The route was extended west to Centreville, and was removed from the state highway system in 1967.|$|E

5|$|At Final Resolution, Roode and Booker T fought {{again in}} a Mixed Tag Team match. Sharmell had come to Roode's manager Ms. Brooks' defense on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact! after Roode belittled her for losing a match, {{providing}} {{a reason for the}} encounter. At Final Resolution, Sharmell and Booker T defeated Roode <b>and</b> <b>Ms.</b> Brooks in a Mixed Tag Team match. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell, injuring her in the storyline. This led to a match between Roode and Booker T at Against All Odds, which ended in a double count-out. At TNA's Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008, Roode defeated Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap match. Sharmell returned after this encounter, resulting in an Intergender Tag Team Six Sides of Steel Cage match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 13, 2008 pitting Roode and his new manager Payton Banks against Booker T and Sharmell, which the later team won.|$|E
5|$|At Final Resolution, {{the team}} of Robert Roode <b>and</b> <b>Ms.</b> Brooks fought {{the team of}} Booker T and Sharmell. The storyline behind this {{encounter}} involved Sharmell coming {{to the defense of}} Roode's manager Ms. Brooks, who Roode verbally abused on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell in the face, resulting in a storyline fractured jaw which sidelined her from appearing for the promotion and upsetting her real-life husband Booker T. Following the event, Roode fired Brooks and higher her replacement Payton Banks on the January 10 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Against All Odds. TNA promoted a match between Booker T and Robert Roode heading into Against All Odds.|$|E

5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth <b>and</b> <b>MS</b> lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E
5|$|Robert Roode <b>and</b> <b>Ms.</b> Brooks facing Booker T and Sharmell in a Mixed Tag Team {{match was}} also {{promoted}} for the event.

This followed with weekly segments involving Sharmell, Brooks, and Roode on Impact!, leading to an encounter between Roode and Booker T on the December 27 episode of Impact!.

40|$|CONTEXT: Investigation of activin-A (A) <b>and</b> myostatin (<b>M)</b> {{in human}} myometrium (HM) and {{leiomyoma}} (HL) will explain {{their involvement in}} human myometrial pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> response <b>and</b> steroid regulation in HM. We also evaluated A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> expression <b>and</b> response in HL. DESIGN: Tissues were analyzed and cultured. PATIENTS: Patients included fertile (in proliferative phase) and menopausal women undergoing hysterectomy. INTERVENTIONS: HM explant cultures were treated with A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> (for Smad- 7 mRNA quantification) or estrogen and progesterone (for A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> mRNA quantification). A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> expression levels were also evaluated in menopausal (physiological absence of steroids) HM specimens. A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> <b>and</b> their receptors were evaluated in HL (n = 8, diameter 5 - 8 cm) compared with their matched HM. HL explants cultures were treated with A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> (for Smad 7 mRNA quantification), and, to explain the absence of response, the levels of follistatin, follistatin-related gene (FLRG), and Cripto were evaluated. RESULTS: A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> increased Smad 7 expression in HM explants. A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> mRNAs were both reduced after estradiol treatment, unchanged after progesterone treatment, but were higher in menopausal than fertile (in proliferative phase) specimens. A, <b>M,</b> <b>and</b> FLRG were expressed at higher levels in HL compared with adjacent HM, whereas the receptors, follistatin, and Smad 7 mRNAs resulted unchanged. Cripto mRNA was expressed only in HL. CONCLUSIONS: A <b>and</b> <b>M</b> act on human HM and are regulated by steroids. In HL there is an increase of A, <b>M,</b> FLRG, <b>and</b> Cripto expressio...|$|R

5|$|The current {{alignments}} of MS 198 existed by 1928 as unnumbered roads.

MS 15 was designated onto MS 24 east of Beaumont and in McLain and what is now the Lucedale portion of MS 198 in 1936. A year later, the portion of road east of Lucedale was paved. In 1938, the portion of current MS 198 southwest of Columbia was paved. The road east of Tylertown was paved by 1939. In 1940, a new alignment of MS 24 between McComb and Tylertown was under construction, which included what is now MS 198 northwest of Tylertown. Also by this time, the road between Columbia <b>and</b> <b>MS</b> 44 was paved. In 1941, the portions of road in Hattiesburg, east of Beaumont, in McLain, and northwest of Lucedale were paved. The road west of Beaumont was paved in 1943. The portion of MS 24 between McComb and Tylertown was completed as a paved road in 1944.
