40|$|Clinical trials with {{pandemic}} influenza vaccine candidates have focused on <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> as an adjuvant to boost humoral immune responses. In this study we investigated the effect of <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> on the magnitude and type of immune response induced by whole-inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine. Balb/c mice were immunized once {{with a range of}} antigen doses (0. 04 - 5 mu g) of WIV produced from A/PR/ 8 virus, either atone or in combination with <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers of mice receiving WIV + <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> were 4 - 16 -fold higher than HI titers in mice receiving the same dose of WIV alone, indicating the boosting effect of <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> WIV induced a TH 1 skewed humoral and cellular immune response, characterized by strong influenza-specific IgG 2 a responses and a high number of IFN gamma-secreting T cells. In contrast, immunization with WIV adsorbed to <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> resulted in skewing of this response to a TH 2 phenotype (high IgG 1 levels and a low number of IFN gamma-producing T cells). To assess the effect of the observed immune response skewing on viral clearance from the lungs mice immunized once with 1 mu g WIV without or with <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> were challenged with A/PR/ 8 virus 4 weeks later. The immunized mice showed a significant decrease in viral lung titers compared to control mice receiving buffer. However, despite higher antibody titers, mice immunized with WIV adsorbed to <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> suffered from more severe weight loss and had significantly higher virus Loads in their lung tissue than mice receiving WIV alone. Major difference between these groups of mice was the type of immune response induced, TH 2 instead of TH 1, indicating that a TH 1 response {{plays a major role in}} viral clearance.

40|$|The {{sorption}} of phosphate on amorphous <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> {{was investigated}} using Al- 27 and P- 31 solid-state magic-angle spinning {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, following the effect of different exposures to soluble phosphate. The spectra obtained were compared with the spectrum of amorphous aluminium phosphate. Aluminium in the unreacted hydroxide had a 100 % octahedral co-ordination. When dried at 200 -degrees-C and exposed to soluble phosphate, very little (maximum 0. 1 %) amorphous <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> transformed to a tetrahedral co-ordination (Al bound by oxygen bridges to four P atoms), even after 120 d. The tetrahedral co-ordination exists in aluminium phosphate gel, although most of its Al atoms exhibit an octahedral co-ordination. For the <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> dried at 200 -degrees-C, no formation of aluminium phosphate in which aluminium is in octahedral co-ordination could be detected, not even when the <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was exposed to a phosphate solution for 120 d. We concluded that the formation of aluminium phosphate is restricted {{to the surface of}} the hydroxide. Most of the phosphate which is bound to the aluminium oxide however may not have formed a 'bulk solid' aluminium phosphate, but is adsorbed on the internal and external surface of the oxide. The same amorphous <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> dried at 70 -degrees-C instead of 200 -degrees-C, is converted much more rapidly to aluminium phosphate when exposed to soluble phosphate. We propose a P-induced weathering mechanism to describe P sorption on amorphous <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> at high P concentrations. In addition to NMR, phosphate adsorption experiments conducted on <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> dried at different temperatures produced evidence that the porosity of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> aggregated particles can also be a factor controlling the rate of phosphate uptake from solution, if the aggregate is stable (is not resuspended) in solution. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium-containing {{adjuvants}} {{are often}} used to enhance the potency of vaccines. In the present work we studied whether adsorption of diphtheria toxoid to colloidal <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> induces conformational changes of the antigen. Diphtheria toxoid has a high affinity for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles based on a high adsorption degree, adsorption rate and adsorptive capacity. The conformation and stability of diphtheria toxoid in solution and adsorbed to <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> adjuvant were characterized using five physicochemical techniques: intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Diphtheria toxoid adsorbed to <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> resulted in a minimal shift of the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum, whereas a large increase in the emission of the Bis-ANS probe was observed, indicating that hydrophobic sites of the protein became accessible due to adsorption. In addition, circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy revealed that adsorption to <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> caused an increase of beta-sheet content and a decrease of a-helix content in diphtheria toxoid. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated a major decrease in the enthalpy of denaturation upon adsorption. In conclusion, the adsorption of diphtheria toxoid to <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> adjuvant leads to substantial conformational changes in the antigen. Since physicochemical methods {{can be used to}} monitor these conformational changes, these analytical methods might offer a tool in regulatory required vaccine quality control by demonstrating consistency in production.

40|$|BACKGROUND The B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile {{enterotoxin}} (LTB) is {{a potent}} mucosal immune adjuvant. However, there is little information about LTB's potential as a parenteral adjuvant. OBJECTIVES We aimed at evaluating and better understanding rLTB's potential as a parenteral adjuvant using the fused R 1 repeat of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae P 97 adhesin as an antigen to characterise the humoral immune response induced by this construct and comparing it to that generated when <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is used as adjuvant instead. METHODS BALB/c mice were immunised intraperitoneally with either rLTBR 1 or recombinant R 1 adsorbed onto <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The levels of systemic anti-rR 1 antibodies (total Ig, IgG 1, IgG 2 a, and IgA) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ratio of IgG 1 and IgG 2 a was used to characterise a Th 1, Th 2, or mixed Th 1 /Th 2 immune response. FINDINGS Western blot confirmed rR 1, either alone or fused to LTB, remained antigenic; anti-cholera toxin ELISA confirmed that LTB retained its activity when expressed in a heterologous system. Mice immunised with the rLTBR 1 fusion protein produced approximately twice as much anti-rR 1 immunoglobulins as mice vaccinated with rR 1 adsorbed onto <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Animals vaccinated with either rLTBR 1 or rR 1 adsorbed onto <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> presented a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 immune response. We speculate {{this might be a}} result of rR 1 immune modulation rather than adjuvant modulation. Mice immunised with rLTBR 1 produced approximately 1. 5 -fold more serum IgA than animals immunised with rR 1 and <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> MAIN CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that rLTB is a more powerful parenteral adjuvant than <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> when administered intraperitoneally as it induced higher antibody titres. Therefore, we recommend that rLTB be considered an alternative adjuvant, even if different administration routes are employed...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 83 - 90. Beta alumina solid {{electrolyte}} material is conventionally synthesized {{by the high}} temperature solid state reaction of α-Al₂O₃ with soda and a stabilizer ion such as lithia or magnesia. This reaction requires a reconstructive transformation of the α-Al₂O₃ oxygen sublattice and results in a two-phase mixture of β and β"-Al₂O. In order to maximize the preferred β"-Al₂O₃ phase an additional peak heat treatment schedule is required. This work investigated {{the replacement of the}} α-Al ₂O₃ component of the reaction mixture with a range of synthetic <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> precursor materials. Four different <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> precursors were synthesized by the controlled hydrolysis of a common aluminium isopropoxide parent material. The oxygen sublattice of each <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> precursor was engineered by varying the alkoxide hydrolysis conditions. These precursors were used to synthesize beta alumina powders by the high temperature solid state reaction with soda and lithia, resulting in powders with a nominal composition of Li₀. ₃₈Na₁. ₆₅Al₁₀. ₆₆O₁₇. The solid state reactions were monitored by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The structural development of the reaction products with increasing temperature, was monitored by powder X-ray diffraction. A significant observation was the direct formation of single phase β"-Al₂O₃ at 1200 °C by the solid state reaction of soda and lithia with certain <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxides.</b> The work concludes with the proposal of a generalized mechanism relating the <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> precursor oxygen sublattice {{to the nature of the}} beta alumina reaction product...|$|R

Dissolution was studied using the United States Pharmacopeia paddle method in buffer pH 5. 0 and the data most aptly fitted a bi-exponential dissolution model which represented dissolution occurring from dispersed and agglomerated particles. The dispersion of IMC mixtures was measured in dissolution media under non-sink conditions by laser diffraction. The dissolution of IMC increased as a function of the concentration of <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (5 - 20 %) added to the mixtures. Increasing the proportion of larger particles of the cohesive <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> increased the dissolution rate of IMC. The enhanced dissolution was attributed to increases in both the dissolution rate constant and initial concentration of dispersed particles. Mechanistically, the <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was found to facilitate the detachment of IMC particles from the carrier surface, forming a complex interactive mixture that more readily deagglomerated than the cohesive drug agglomerates. The outcomes of this work would therefore allow more careful control and selection of the excipient specifications in producing solid dosage formulations with improved dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs...|$|R
