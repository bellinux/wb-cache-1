A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. <b>Antoine</b> and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, <b>Antoine</b> told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of <b>Antoine,</b> who distributed money to the poor. <b>Antoine</b> and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by <b>Antoine</b> testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment.

5000|$|Dinner at <b>Antoine's,</b> a 1947 {{murder mystery}} by Frances Parkinson Keyes, {{begins with a}} dinner party in the 1840 Room and {{includes}} another dinner party at <b>Antoine's</b> near the end. <b>Antoine's</b> itself is not pivotal to the plot, which hinges on {{the murder of a}} woman from a snobbish-but-impoverished old Creole family, just as she was beginning to face a serious chronic illness. Rather, <b>Antoine's</b> is part of the ambiance of New Orleans, which Keyes depicts as an exotic, half-foreign city whose ways are not easily understood by outsiders, especially those from the North. The novel is notable for its use of the [...] "least likely person" [...] motif in revealing the identity of the murderer, and for a final plot twist that renders the murder and its aftermath even more tragic. <b>Antoine's</b> is mentioned in other novels by Keyes, including Once on Esplanade, Crescent Carnival, The River Road, and its sequel, Vail D'Alvery. Dinner at <b>Antoine's</b> was Keyes's best-selling and best-known book.|$|R
