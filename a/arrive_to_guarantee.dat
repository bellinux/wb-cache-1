40|$|A medium {{access control}} {{protocol}} for a wireless multihop network is described and evaluated. The network is able <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> the bandwidth contracted to a connection in a hidden station environment and to most efficiently use the spectrum capacity by providing a mechanism for dynamic channel allocation to services. Both channel and packet switched services are supported, based on real channel connections. Ad-hoc networks without a central control node can be realized due {{to the ability of}} any station to route connections according to the current meshing of the network. Channels are established and used for the duration of a so called train of data packets, released when the train ends and reestablished when the next train <b>arrives.</b> <b>To</b> <b>guarantee</b> available capacity of the network for the reestablishment of a connection, connection admission control is applied and new connections are accepted only if spare capacity is available. The traffic performance of the proposed protocol is given by [...] ...|$|R

The groups of students involved in this research are of those who failed the eighth grade of primary education and are now doing extra class studies through the Teaching and Learning Project of Cycle II {{at the state of}} São Paulo. The objective of this research is to identify and to show the actions and the problems related to the pedagogical practice of the Mathematics teacher and to check if this actions propitiate, or not, advances in the process of learning of the these specials groups of students that are {{at the end of the}} basic education. This study also tried to show the daily routine of the Mathematics teacher who works in such particular classes and how they think, act and work with the interference of an institution as well as the relationships inside it. A qualitative approach was used in this research and the processes of investigation utilized were: documental analysis focused on the analysis of the already mentioned Project, application of questionnaire, class observation and interviews with the teachers. The analysis of the collected data revealed the teacher's disbelief about the project, mainly about the way that it was planed, promoted and implemented. The absence of schools's infrastructures and of others institutional conditions were highlighted as an obstacle for the project's success. One of the pointed conditions is referred to the way how schools are still working from the administrative view, similar to the series schools. Some of the investigated Mathematics teacher's revealed compromising with the project and showed as singular practice to work with these special students and even without the ideal conditions they <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> learning conditions for them. It concludes that only with State, teachers and schools's compromising, students's learning conditions can be guarantee...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Some {{applications}} such as {{audio and video conferencing}} require a network <b>to</b> provide QoS <b>guarantee.</b> End- 2 -End delay is one of the prominent factors in QoS. Packets after crossing the routers queue <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> destination node. Thus with guaranteeing the queuing delay in routers the network will be able <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> End- 2 -End delay. Furthermore developers can contract service level agreement (SLA) intelligently. In order <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> queuing delay, congestion control algorithms can be used in routers. Furthermore providers can contract service level agreement (SLA) intelligently. Congestion control algorithms are a solution <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> queuing delay. Random early detection (RED) is the most known and applicable congestion control algorithm. Although extended researches in this field were carried out, but there is no investigation on queuing delay guarantee in RED based queue yet. To achieve this goal, in this paper a novel method using stochastic learning automata is proposed. In the proposed method, thresholds of RED algorithm, in order <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> delay, in opposite to previous approaches are adjusted dynamically. Proposed method, in addition the delay guaranteeing, can increase the utilization of output link. Therefore, the proposed method can provide better QoS...|$|R
