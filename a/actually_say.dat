500|$|Confusion {{was caused}} {{prior to the}} {{broadcast}} of this episode when many critics speculated about how the episode would tackle {{the use of the}} word MILF without actually explaining that it is an acronym for [...] "Mother I'd Like to Fuck", as that would have broken Federal Communications Commission rules. The situation was compared to the episode of Seinfeld called [...] "The Contest" [...] which features the subject of masturbation but the characters could never <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> the word [...] "masturbation" [...] and did so via metaphors.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Bill, portrayed by W. Earl Brown, is {{revealed to be}} homosexual {{at one point in}} the game. Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel does not voice them. [...] "he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> that to Joel, and warn Joel about that stuff," [...] Druckmann said.|$|E
500|$|After a while, Ted {{realizes she}} didn't <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> the word 'no', {{just that she}} didn't have time, and so decides to take her out on a [...] "two-minute date" [...] - to dinner at a table at the café next door to her {{practice}} and [...] "the important parts" [...] of [...] at the electronics store two doors down, with help from Ranjit (Marshall Manesh) and Wendy the Waitress. The date goes well, and Stella promises to call if she ever has time. Finally, Abby sees Ted outside the clinic holding flowers he tried to give to Stella, and chases him down the street. She is then seen at the reception telling Barney about how he toyed with her emotions, after which they go out to have sex.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the success}} of [...] "Day 'n' Nite", the rapper had {{said that he would}} never try to mix {{politics}} or jocular things in with his lyrical content. After realizing the power of his voice he then decided to make important and unique songs, focusing on the message, rather than just creating inane music. He said his mode of operation at that time [...] "was just, 'Hey, I'm making these cool sounding songs and I have little messages in them'", but still had himself in it. Although Cudi had a message in every track, he chose to avoid using dense lyrics, explaining {{that he did not want}} to write material that he would not <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> or use in real life, adding that being true to yourself entirely was meaningful to him. [...] "I don't speak like a fucking nerdy guy; I speak like a regular dude", he remarked.|$|E
500|$|Bill's {{appearance}} {{was designed to}} reflect practicality, as opposed to self-expression; most of his clothing and gear {{can also be used}} as a survival tool. Bill is revealed to be homosexual {{at one point in the}} game. Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel doesn't voice them. [...] "he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> that to Joel, and warn Joel about that stuff," [...] Druckmann said. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality [...] "added to his character ... without really tokenizing him". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the [...] "most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013", calling him [...] "deeply flawed but wholly unique".|$|E
500|$|While many of {{the changes}} were down to the {{logistics}} of filming in Venice, some were for creative reasons, the most prominent being {{the inclusion of the}} famous love scene. [...] The scene was in fact an unscripted last minute improvisation by Roeg, who felt that without it there would be too many scenes of the couple arguing. The scene set in the church where Laura lights a candle for Christine was mostly improvised too. Originally intended to show the gulf between John's and Laura's mental states—John's denial and Laura's inability to let go—the script included two pages of dialogue to illustrate John's unease at Laura's marked display of grief. After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being [...] "silly", and the church was [...] "beautiful". Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life {{in terms of what the}} characters would <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> to each other, and that the scripted version was [...] "overwritten", so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.|$|E

500|$|The {{placement}} {{of a character}} of indigenous peoples descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media. Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was [...] "erhaps the most well-known". Of Chakotay's origin, he said, [...] "They never <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> what nation he is, but I do believe it's some Central American tribe." [...] Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the Twilight film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction. Chakotay was also described as [...] "the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting" [...] in the 2005 book, [...] "Indian" [...] Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction: First Nations' Voices Speak Out, but was {{also referred to as}} the [...] "quintessential Tonto in outer space". A similar criticism was highlighted of the character in Medicine Bags and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War (2008), which called Chakotay [...] "a creature of white fantasies" [...] and suggested that he was [...] "far more stereotypical than Tonto" [...] as [...] "at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in awhile".|$|E
500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. And even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> in real life.|$|E
2500|$|And a {{follow-up}} email {{from the same}} day: [...] "Decompression sickness, or caisson disease, or [...] "the bends" [...] was first documented in the 1840s. [...] A competent doctor could not mistake this condition for malaria or some other tropical fever. [...] I notice the article doesn't <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> malaria - - -it says [...] "fever." [...] There are dozens.|$|E
50|$|Another {{complaint}} was {{the absence of}} the play-within-the-play. Though much is made of that play's immense impact, {{there is no evidence of}} what that play <b>actually</b> <b>says,</b> proclaims, describes, or portrays that would produce such an effect.|$|R

2500|$|On 13 October 2008, at an inquest {{into the}} death, a police {{surveillance}} officer {{admitted that he}} had deleted a computer record of Cressida Dick's instruction that they could allow Menezes to 'run on to Tube as [...] not carrying anything.' At the inquest he told the court that 'On reflection, I looked at that and thought I cannot <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> that.' The IPCC announced that it would investigate the matter ' highest level of investigation'.|$|E
2500|$|The Talmud records a {{tradition}} that unattributed statements of the law represent the views of Rabbi Meir (Sanhedrin 86a), which supports the theory (recorded by Sherira Gaon in his famous Iggeret) {{that he was the}} author of an earlier collection. For this reason, the few passages that <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> [...] "this is the view of Rabbi Meir" [...] represent cases where the author intended to present Rabbi Meir's view as a [...] "minority opinion" [...] not representing the accepted law.|$|E
2500|$|In Bobby Lee's [...] "Tae Do," [...] {{a parody}} of Korean dramas in a Mad TV episode, the {{subtitles}} make more sense of the story than the Korean language being spoken. [...] The subtitles are made to appear as though written by someone with a poor understanding of grammar and are often intentionally made longer than what they <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> in the drama. For example, an actor says [...] "Sarang" [...] ("I love you"), but the subtitle is [...] so long that it covers the whole screen.|$|E
5000|$|In the Alvino Rey song, {{the female}} singer teasingly turns down her male caller with a songful of rejections: [...] "I said no, no, no". The song's twist ending {{is that she}} is <b>actually</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "no" [...] to a Liberty subscription.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a general}} way, the {{keyboard}} {{can be thought}} of as divided down the center, between T and Y, G and H, and N and M. [...] The keys in each zone are numbered moving away from this dividing line: so we should <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> that in zone QWERT, T is the first letter, R is the second, and E the third; in zone YUIOP, Y is the first, U is the second, I the third, etc. [...] For XCVBN, N is the first, and so on. [...] In HJKLM, consider M to be the last in the series, even though it does not lie on the line.|$|E
2500|$|Carney {{argues that}} an {{emphasis}} on interpreting symbolism shows a [...] "high school" [...] understanding of art, and {{that this kind of}} [...] "decoder ring" [...] approach is in place because it is easier to grasp and makes scholars feel more important and esoteric. Carney believes that the meaning of a creative work lies at its surface, and imagines a world where art is appreciated for what it objectively contains rather than what is read into it, an aesthetic he refers to as pragmatic. He argues that audiences can, for example, simply appreciate the acting in a film and gain meaning from this, what the characters <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> and do, and the tonal shifts that accompany these actions.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{strategy}} is the correlative-clause strategy used by Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages, {{as well as}} Bambara. This {{strategy is}} equivalent to saying [...] "Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter" [...] or [...] "Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife". It is [...] "correlative" [...] because of the corresponding [...] "which ... that ..." [...] demonstratives or [...] "which ... she/he/it ..." [...] pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. Note that the shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. Note also {{that there is no}} need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> something equivalent to [...] "I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife".|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Maud {{tells her}} father {{she will never}} marry Sleeny. She is wooed by Bott, who is a spiritualist and a Bread-winner, and also by Offitt.

50|$|Hitler's rage at Steiner's {{failure to}} mount the attack was made famous by its {{depiction}} in {{a scene from the}} 2004 movie Downfall.

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 15, CBS aired a segment that {{featured}} an interview with Marian Carr Knox, a secretary at Ellington Air Force Base from 1956–1979, and who was Killian's assistant on the dates shown in the documents. Dan Rather prefaced the segment on the recorded interview by stating [...] "She told us she believes what the documents <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> is, exactly, as we reported." [...] In the aired interview, Knox expressed her belief that the documents reflected Killian's [...] "sentiments" [...] about Bush's service, and that this belief motivated her decision {{to reach out to}} CBS to provide the interview. In response to a direct question from Rather about the authenticity of the memo on Bush's alleged insubordination, she stated that no such memo was ever written; she further emphasized that she would have known if such a memo existed, as she had sole responsibility to type Killian's memos in that time period. At this point, she also admitted she had no firsthand knowledge of Bush's time in the Guard. However, controversially, Knox said later in the interview, [...] "The information in here was correct, but it was picked up from the real ones." [...] She went on to say, [...] "I probably typed the information and somebody picked up the information some way or another." [...] The New York Times headline report on this interview, including the phrase [...] "Fake but Accurate," [...] created an immediate backlash from critics of CBS's broadcast. The conservative-leaning Weekly Standard proceeded to predict the end of CBS's news division.|$|E

6000|$|... "Besides," [...] he went on, [...] "you're {{assuming}} that the thing this letter hints at will really come off. I don't think it will. A man {{would have to be}} such an awful blackguard to go as low as that. The least grain of decency in him would stop him. I can imagine a man threatening to do it as a piece of bluff--by the way, the letter doesn't <b>actually</b> <b>say</b> anything of the sort, though I suppose it hints at it--but I can't imagine anybody out of a melodrama doing it." ...|$|E
