40|$|A {{discrete}} event {{simulation model}} has been developed to predict the assembly flow time of a new radar product. The simulation was the key tool employed to identify flow constraints. The radar, production facility, and equipment complement were designed, arranged, and selected to provide the most manufacturable assembly possible. A goal was to reduce the assembly and testing cycle time from twenty-six weeks. A computer software simulation package (SLAM 2) was utilized {{as the foundation for}} simulating the assembly flow time. FORTRAN subroutines were incorporated into the software to deal with unique flow circumstances that were not accommodated by the software. Detailed information relating to the assembly operations was provided by a team selected from the engineering, manufacturing management, inspection, <b>and</b> <b>production</b> <b>assembly</b> staff. The simulation verified that {{it would be possible to}} achieve the cycle time goal of six weeks. Equipment and manpower constraints were identified during the simulation process and adjusted as required to achieve the flow with a given monthly production requirement. The simulation is being maintained as a planning tool to be used to identify constraints in the event that monthly output is increased. 'What-if' studies have been conducted to identify the cost of reducing constraints caused by increases in output requirement...|$|E

This project {{relates to}} the further development and prototype construction/evaluation for the Energy Transfer Multiplexer (ETM) power converter topology concept. The ETM uses a series resonant link to transfer energy from any phase of a multiphase input to any phase of a multiphase output, converting any input voltage and frequency to any output voltage and frequency. The basic form of the ETM converter consists of an eight (8) -switch matrix (six phase power switches and two ground power switches) and a series L-C resonant circuit. Electronic control of the switches allows energy to be transferred in the proper amount from any phase to any other phase. Depending upon the final circuit application, the switches may be either SCRs or IGBTs. The inherent characteristics of the ETM converter include the following: Power processing in either direction (bidirectional); Large voltage gain without the need of low frequency magnetics; High efficiency independent of output load and frequency; Wide bandwidth with fast transient response and; Operation as a current source. The ETM is able to synthesize true sinusoidal waveforms with low harmonic distortions. For a low power PM wind generation system, the ETM has the following characteristics and advantages: It provides voltage gain without the need of low frequency magnetics (DC inductors) and; It has constant high efficiency independent of the load. The ETM converter can be implemented into a PM wind power system with smaller size, reduced weight and lower cost. As {{a result of our}} analyses, the ETM offers wind power generation technology for the reduction of the cost and size as well as the increase in performance of low power, low wind speed power generation. This project is the further theoretical/analytical exploration of the ETM converter concept in relationship to PM wind power generator applications in the 100 kW and under power range. The theoretical/analytical and bench scale work focuses on simplifying the basic ETM converter topology (in terms of parts count and complexity) for the specific application of the low power PM system. The project goals and objectives were for Spellman HV will develop a 100 kW prototype ETM power converter based on paralleled lower ratings converters. The proposed configuration of this prototype is a 100 kW rated converter comprised of four (4) 34 kW rated modules connected in parallel (the fourth converter is included to demonstrate N+ 1 fault tolerance). This approach is more viable as there is lower technological risk involved in developing a 34 kW-rated converter than a single 100 kW unit. The modular system approach should have a lower deployment and service cost over a single unit system, because of the economics of scale (smaller units at a higher volume means lower manufacturing cost) and because of improved serviceability (a non-redundant power system with one failed module will still operate at a lower power level). There is also the added benefit that greater commercial application and acceptance should be achieved by having a modular system available in which fault tolerance (N+ 1 or 2 N) is a feature. This modular approach would allow the output power to be increased by adding more paralleled converters. Thus, the maximum output power of the overall power system {{is a function of the}} interconnection medium (the hot swap connection subsystem), rather than the ratings of a single module. The project was implemented with Spellman HV acting as the program management <b>and</b> <b>production</b> <b>assembly</b> and test facility; The Baker Company acting as a technical consultant and resource when required; and dtm Associates acting as the design/development resource for the hardware development of the 100 kW ETM converter prototype...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} - The paper explores and {{describes}} the impact of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology on inventory accuracy within a <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> plant, and proposes a model for assessing {{the impact of the}} technology on inventory accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical investigation, based on case study research, focuses on an RFID implementation at a supplier of injection-moulded, surface-treated plastic to the automotive industry. This implementation {{is one of the few}} item-level, open-loop RFID implementations in the automotive industry. Findings - The empirical study provides insights into how inventory accuracy has been improved and made attainable in practice by implementing RFID, and indicates that the technology ensures inventory inaccuracy will be kept at minimum. As a result, an analytical model is presented which identifies the impact of RFID technology on inventory accuracy. Research limitations/implications - The case study and context need to be considered when generalising upon the findings. Furthermore, it is hoped future research could further develop the model presented and test it against implementation practice. Practical implications - RFID technology provides practitioners with the opportunity to eliminate waste, <b>and</b> improve <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> performance. The research provides practitioners with experience of, and insights into how a <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> plant has improved inventory accuracy by implementing RFID technology. In particular, practitioners are provided with a model which enables them to assess the impact of RFID on inventory accuracy. Original/value of paper - This paper contributes to the RFID community by providing empirical insights into the impact of RFID technology on inventory accuracy, but also more broadly into logistics and operations management research...|$|R
