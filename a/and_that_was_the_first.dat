5|$|Smythe's {{first home}} was 51 McMillan Street, {{now known as}} Mutual Street, {{not far from the}} future site of Maple Leaf Gardens. He was the second of two {{children}} born to Mary and Albert. Conn had a sister, Mary, five years older, who died due to illness in 1903. The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe's youth, the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe's wages at the time. At one point, Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Mary and Polly stayed on North Street. Conn's mother Mary died in 1906, and Smythe attributes his mother's drinking with making him a lifelong abstainer from alcohol. At age eleven Conn was christened <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that he insisted on Conn instead of his given name of Constantine. Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter Moira.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ancient}} Greeks adopted the alphabet, {{they had no}} use for a letter to {{represent}} the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.|$|E
25|$|Vincenzo Lancia {{was born}} on 24 of August 1881 in Fobello near Turin. His father wanted Vincenzo to be a lawyer, but didn't have much {{interest}} in the humanities. He met the Battista brothers as well as Giovanni Ceirano and became interested in science and technology, especially automobiles. He saw his first cars in Turin and Milan. One of his friends Carlo Bishareti di Ruffia had a Benz <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> important automobile in his life. When FIAT was founded in 1899 Vincenzo was very active in the company and later {{became one of the}} most famous test drivers of Italian automobile brands. In 1922, Vincenzo married his secretary - Adele Miglietti. Vincenzo and Adele had three children Gianni, Eleonora and Maria. He died on February 15, 1937.|$|E

Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw <b>the</b> lightning, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> thunder, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> big guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> rain falling, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> drops of blood falling; and {{when we came to}} get <b>the</b> crops, it <b>was</b> dead men <b>that</b> we reaped." ...|$|R

500|$|Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse, {{an actor}} in such films as Carry On Sergeant (1958), would later host the British game show The Golden Shot between 1967 and 1972. He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time I ever heard the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
500|$|Originally titled as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You", [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was written}} by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song {{was inspired by the}} Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not kill us makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice. Although Tamposi found the phrase as saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended [...] "Stronger" [...] for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process. Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, to produce a demo track later to be pitched to RCA A executive Jeff Aldrich, who later gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track. Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, [...] "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song." [...] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger. saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, [...] "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central {{idea was}} {{what you might call}} the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eysenck’s {{attitude}} was summarised {{in his autobiography}} Rebel with a Cause: [...] "I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> truth as he sees it. If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> too bad. Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> facts."

2500|$|Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio {{hailed the}} group for their song [...] "Kiss Them for Me". Sitek stated: [...] "I've always {{tried to make a}} song that begins like [...] "Kiss Them for Me". I think songs like [...] "I Was a Lover" [...] or [...] "Wash the Day Away" [...] came from that element of {{surprise}} mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you're like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends're going to fall for this. I feel like that transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> example where I thought, we've got them, they're hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{had moved}} about [...] from Lincoln Street along a Capitol Park paved walkway, saw [...] "a {{woman in a}} brightly colored dress", and stopped {{approximately}} halfway to the state Capitol. People {{on either side of}} Ford wanted to shake hands with him and Ford assumed that the woman in red wanted to shake hands or talk. Twenty-six-year-old Fromme was positioned [...] from Ford, behind the first row of the crowd, and reached into her flowing red robe, drawing the Colt [...]45 pistol from her leg holster. Fromme raised her right arm towards Ford, through the front row of people, and pointed the gun at a height between Ford's knees and his waist. From Ford's perspective, he noted, [...] "... as I stopped, I saw a hand come through the crowd in the first row, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> active gesture that I saw, but in the hand there was a gun".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1979, the American mini-series Holocaust {{aired in}} West Germany. The series, which was watched by 20 million people or 50% of West Germans, first brought {{the matter of}} the {{genocide}} in World War II to widespread public attention {{in a way that it}} had never been before. After each part of Holocaust was aired, there was a companion show where a panel of historians could answer questions from people phoning in. The historians' panels were literally overwhelmed with thousands of phone calls from shocked and outraged Germans, a great many of whom stated that they were born after 1945 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that they learned that their country had practiced genocide in World War II. By the late 1970s, an initially small number of young people had started to demand that the Länder governments stop neglecting the sites of the concentration camps, and start turning them into proper museums and sites of remembrance, turning them into [...] "locations of learning" [...] meant to jar visitors into thinking critically about the Nazi period.|$|E

2500|$|The {{siege of}} Alessandria was an {{important}} event in Frederick's fifth campaign as this was a campaign of revenge, {{with the aim of}} the total destruction of the Lombard League and the removal of the Pope Alexander III. Frederick's next goal was therefore the Lombard city of Alessandria. Alessandria was founded by Milanese refugees, who fled after Frederick's forces burned and destroyed the city of Milan in 1162 and named after Pope Alexander III. The siege of the [...] "Straw City", called so because all the roofs were covered with straw, began at the end of October. To Frederick's surprise and anger, his forces were not able to take the city so he had to spend the winter in front of its gates. On Holy Saturday, Frederick's forces managed to enter the city by digging tunnels under its walls, but the attack was repulsed by the Milanese with heavy losses. Alessandria withstood, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> victory of the Lombard League. Frederick had to break off the siege due to an advancing Lombard army and retreated to Pavia.|$|E
