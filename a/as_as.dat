5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup.

In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated <b>AS</b> <b>as</b> a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E

5|$|Standard {{diagnostic}} criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development. Unlike the international standard, the DSM-IV-TR criteria also required significant impairment in day-to-day functioning; DSM-5 eliminated <b>AS</b> <b>as</b> a separate diagnosis in 2013, and folded {{it into the}} umbrella of autism spectrum disorders.

5|$|Outside {{the field}} of comics, Adams has also {{provided}} illustrations for various magazines, such <b>as</b> , <b>as</b> well as toy designs, video games, and X-Men-themed cans of Chef Boyardee pasta. In 2016 he provided the illustration for a satirical piece in GQ magazine that imagined a number of controversial public figures as comic book supervillains, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Sepp Blatter, Martin Shkreli and Kris Jenner. Later that year, Dynamite Entertainment announced it that would be producing limited edition poly-resin busts of female characters for its Women of Dynamite line, based on Adams' renditions of those characters and sculpted by Jason Smith. The first bust was a Red Sonja bust debuting in November, followed by a Vampirella bust in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|The North American and European {{releases}} of Dirge of Cerberus received a major overhaul as the developers were not completely {{satisfied with the}} final Japanese version of the game. They also {{wanted to make the}} game more single-player oriented, and as such, they removed Online Multiplayer support, primarily {{due to the lack of}} popularity of PlayOnline outside Japan, and lack of PS2 HDD support in the U.S. Missions from the Multiplayer Mode were reworked into unlockable secret missions in the English-language versions of the game, although none of the additional storyline presented in the Japanese Multiplayer Mode featured in the English versions. The Easy Mode, which was originally featured in the Japanese version to assist gamers not overly familiar with shooter games, was also removed. On September 11, 2008, the English-language version was released in Japan <b>as</b> , <b>as</b> part of Square's Ultimate Hits lineup.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (<b>AS)</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is {{a subset of the}} broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, <b>AS,</b> <b>as</b> a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{relatively}} few differences are reported between Asperger's and autism on parameters related to causation. A standard {{assumption is that}} Asperger's and autism have a common cause, and are variable expressions of the same underlying disorder. A 2008 review of classification studies found that results largely did not support differences between the diagnoses, and that the most salient group characteristics came from IQ characterizations. The current ASD classification may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the conditions. A panel session at a 2008 diagnosis-related autism research planning conference noted problems with the classification of <b>AS</b> <b>as</b> a distinct subgroup of ASD, and two of three breakout groups recommended eliminating <b>AS</b> <b>as</b> a separate diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Within lexical semantics, {{especially}} {{as applied to}} computers, modeling word meaning is easier when a given word is {{understood in terms of}} related words; semantic networks are therefore important in computational linguistics. Still, other methods in phonology (e.g. optimality theory, which uses lattice graphs) and morphology (e.g. finite-state morphology, using finite-state transducers) are common in the analysis of language as a graph.
