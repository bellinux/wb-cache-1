500|$|Aside from {{background}} vocal stylings from Lorenz {{and other}} females, Carey added her own lowered vocals into the song, {{giving the impression}} of a [...] "doubled voice." [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] samples R and dance singer Stacy Lattisaw's [...] "Attack of the Name Game". The song's hook and loop were taken and incorporated into the melody of [...] "Heartbreaker", as well as being used as its main instrumental components. The lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. Carey starts with the hook [...] "Gimme your love, gimme your love," [...] repeated eight times. Carey repeats the chorus four times, ending the song with a final [...] "Gimme your love, gimme your love." [...] Chuck Taylor from Billboard described its instrumentation as a [...] "persistent guitar lick" [...] and wrote [...] "There's an identifiable chorus here, and some semblance of verses, but more than anything, this song comes across as <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> jumbled in the background, including Carey's own repetitive harmonies, which in this case sound more like a competition than a compliment." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Wood {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the exploitation film The Sinister Urge (originally titled Racket Queen), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore and Carl Anthony. Filmed in five days, {{this is the last}} mainstream film Wood directed, although it has grindhouse elements. The movie contains an [...] "eerily prescient" [...] scene, in which Carl Anthony's character states, [...] "I look at this slush, and I try to remember, at one time, I made good movies." [...] Ironically, Wood's own career would soon spiral downward into <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> [...] "smut racket" [...] nudie flicks, softcore pornography and end with X-rated novels and films.|$|E
2500|$|Balla's Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash (1912) {{exemplifies the}} Futurists' {{insistence that the}} {{perceived}} world is in constant movement. [...] The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash—and {{the feet of the}} woman walking it—have been multiplied to <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> movement. [...] It illustrates the precepts of the Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting that, [...] "On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career. [...] Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular." [...] His Rhythm of the Bow (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.|$|E

2500|$|Proponents {{of claims}} doubting Obama's {{eligibility}} have been dubbed [...] "birthers" [...] by their critics, who have drawn a parallel with 9/11 conspiracy theorists or [...] "truthers".

MSNBC political commentator Rachel Maddow has defined a [...] "birther" [...] as: [...] Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin has said trutherism exists on {{both the left and}} the right, and has described its persistence: [...] "The plain truth will never mollify a Truther.
