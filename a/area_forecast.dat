40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the National Weather Service Forecast Office in St. Louis, Missouri, to investigate the ability of forecasters to differentiate among different points in a <b>forecast</b> <b>area</b> {{with regard to the}} likelihood of the occurrence of measurable precipitation and the relative ability of forecasters to make point and <b>area</b> precipitation probability <b>forecasts.</b> On each forecasting occasion in the experimental period (November 1972 to March 1973), the forecasters made an average point probability forecast for the St. Louis metropolitan <b>area,</b> point probability <b>forecasts</b> for five specific points in the area, an are a probability forecast, and an expected areal coverage forecast. The results indicate that the forecasters did not differentiate among the five points very often, but that this absence of differences among the point probabilities was justified by the lack of variability exhibited by the observations of precipitation occurrence at these points during the experimental period. Evaluations of the average point probability forecasts, individual point probability forecasts, and expected areal coverage forecasts reveal that these forecasts were quite reliable and accurate and that they were also internally consistent. The <b>area</b> probability <b>forecasts,</b> however, tended not to be consistent with the other forecasts, and the average <b>area</b> probability <b>forecast</b> was considerably lower than the relative frequency of occurrence of precipitation "somewhere in the area.
