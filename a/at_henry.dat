5|$|Chesney {{witnessed}} a charter of Henry fitzEmpress' before Henry's succession {{to the throne}} as Henry II, and {{was present at the}} consecration of Roger de Pont L'Évêque as Archbishop of York on 10October 1154. The bishop then was present <b>at</b> <b>Henry</b> II's coronation on 19 December 1154, and appears to have continued to act as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during the early part of King Henry II's reign; the 1156 Pipe Roll has the sheriff of the county accounting for 10 marks arising from the pleas of the bishop in the county. Chesney was often with the royal court, as he attested a number of Henry II's charters during {{the early part of the}} king's reign, and accompanied him to northern England in 1158 and to Normandy in 1160.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{authority}} {{collapsed in}} England where, in the King's absence, Isabella's faction {{took over the}} administration {{with the support of}} the Church. Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward and Hugh the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to Monmouth Castle, and from there back into England, where he was held <b>at</b> <b>Henry</b> of Lancaster's fortress at Kenilworth. The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.|$|E
5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived. The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. <b>At</b> <b>Henry</b> Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants {{to move into the}} restroom. A house that was full of people floated about half a mile (0.8km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E

5|$|Another early roguelike whose {{development}} pre-dated Rogue was Sword of Fargoal (1982), {{developed by}} Jeff McCord starting in 1979. The game {{was based on}} GammaQuest, an earlier title McCord had created on the Commodore PET which he shared locally with friends while a student <b>at</b> <b>Henry</b> Clay High School in Kentucky; the game itself {{was based on a}} Dungeons & Dragons campaign he had run himself in the prior years. Before graduating and attending the University of Tennessee in 1981, he had started work on GammaQuest II, which required the player to navigate through randomly generated dungeon levels, acquire a sword, and make it back to the surface with that sword through more randomly generated levels. The more advanced computers available at the school, such as the Commodore VIC-20, enabled him to expand out the game further from the highly limited memory on the PET. On seeing the prospects of selling computer software, he eventually got a publication deal with Epyx, where they helped him to refine the marketing of the game, renaming it Sword of Fargoal, and giving him access to the more powerful Commodore 64, enabling him to use graphics and sound as part of the game. The game was considered a success, and when it was ported to the PC in 1983, it out-shone Rogues PC release the same year due to Sword of Fargoals superior graphics and sound.|$|E
5|$|By 1420, James's {{standing}} <b>at</b> <b>Henry</b> V's court improved greatly; he {{ceased to}} be regarded as a hostage and more of a guest. James's value to Henry became apparent in 1420 when he accompanied the English king to France where his presence was used against the Scots fighting on the Dauphinist side. Following the English success at the siege of Melun, a town southeast of Paris, the contingent of Scots were hanged for treason against their king. James attended Catherine of Valois's coronation on 23 February 1421 and was honoured by sitting immediately on the queen's left at the coronation banquet. In March, Henry began a circuit of the important towns in England as a show of strength and it was during this tour that James was knighted on Saint George's day. By July, the two kings were back campaigning in France where James, evidently approving of Henry's methods of kingship, seemed content to endorse the English king's desire for the French crown. Henry appointed the Duke of Bedford and James as the joint commanders of the siege of Dreux on 18 July 1421 and on 20 August they received the surrender of the garrison. Henry died of dysentery on 31 August 1422 and in September James was part of the escort taking the English king's body back to London.|$|E
