Preferred embodiments are directed to process monitoring and/or process control for unit operations involving endpoint detemlination of a distillation, for example, {{as applied to}} <b>a</b> liquid-componentswitching <b>operation</b> (e. g., <b>a</b> solvent switching <b>operation),</b> <b>a</b> liquid-liquid separation <b>operation,</b> <b>a</b> solute concentration <b>operation,</b> <b>a</b> dispersed-phase concentration <b>operation,</b> among others...|$|R
5|$|Given a {{set with}} <b>an</b> {{addition}} <b>operation,</b> one cannot always define <b>a</b> corresponding subtraction <b>operation</b> on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, <b>a</b> subtraction <b>operation</b> uniquely determines <b>an</b> addition <b>operation,</b> <b>an</b> additive inverse <b>operation,</b> and <b>an</b> additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|R
5|$|Compounding {{the loss}} of men to {{reinforce}} 21st Army Group, on 3 July the 115th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn from the division. The brigade was earmarked for <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> to liberate the Channel Islands and was re-designated Force 135. Ultimately such <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> {{did not take place}} and the brigade was deployed to mainland Europe. During August, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division began to disperse. On 15 August, the divisional headquarters ceased commanding any subordinate units {{and by the end of}} the month the division was disbanded.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> ternary <b>operation</b> is <b>an</b> n-ary <b>operation</b> with n = 3. <b>A</b> ternary <b>operation</b> on <b>a</b> set A takes {{any given}} three {{elements}} of A and combines them {{to form a}} single element of A. An example of <b>a</b> ternary <b>operation</b> is the product in a heap.|$|R
50|$|E.g. a group {{theory is}} an {{algebraic}} theory {{because it has}} three functional terms: <b>a</b> binary <b>operation</b> <b>a</b> * b, <b>a</b> nullary <b>operation</b> 1 (neutral element), and <b>a</b> unary <b>operation</b> x → x−1 with the rules of associativity, neutrality and inversion respectively.|$|R

5|$|With {{the partial}} {{destruction}} of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, {{it would be best}} to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E
5|$|A {{draft for}} <b>an</b> <b>Operation</b> Scarlift report {{was written in}} 1973 for Kettle Creek (which Twomile Run is a {{tributary}} of), but was never approved.

5000|$|Several RDBMS (DB2, MySQL) do {{not support}} that the same trigger can be {{attached}} {{to more than one}} operation (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE). In such a case a trigger must be created for each operation; For <b>an</b> INSERT <b>operation</b> only the inserting section must be specified, for <b>a</b> DELETE <b>operation</b> only the deleting section must be specified, and for <b>an</b> UPDATE <b>operation</b> both sections must be present, just as it is shown above (the deleting section first, then the inserting section), because <b>an</b> UPDATE <b>operation</b> is logically represented as <b>a</b> DELETE <b>operation</b> followed by <b>an</b> INSERT <b>operation.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>operation</b> is {{launched}} by the task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E

5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had {{a suspected}} blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent <b>an</b> <b>operation</b> to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre.

5|$|During late 1944 Admiral William Halsey Jr., the {{commander}} of the United States Third Fleet, sought to conduct a raid into the South China Sea and led the development of plans for such <b>an</b> <b>operation.</b> On 21 November he asked Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the head of the United States Pacific Fleet, for permission to begin the attack but was turned down.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories.
