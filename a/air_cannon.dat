5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed <b>air</b> <b>cannon.</b> During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of filming, Aston Martin {{were still in the}} final phases of {{designing}} the DBS. The scene involving the car crash was devised using an Aston Martin DB9 that was especially modified to look like Bond's Aston Martin DBS V12 and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an <b>air</b> <b>cannon</b> located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70mph(113km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] {{took place}} on 21 March 2011. The opening scene in the cornfield were the last shots filmed of the series on 11 July 2011. The scene was filmed last because the crew {{had to wait for}} the corn to grow; Moffat had written the scene in February. Much of Berlin was filmed in Swansea. Vintage vehicles from the period were used; Darvill loved the motorbike, although he was not allowed to ride it as it was the job of the stuntman. The Temple of Peace in Cardiff used in the episode for the German dinner party was also used for Gillan's first Doctor Who appearance, when she played a Soothsayer in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii". Smith, Gillan and Darvill had previously filmed in the Temple of Peace for [...] "Cold Blood" [...] of the previous series. Hitler's office {{was one of the biggest}} sets that had been built for the show. Typically it would have been filmed in a real building, but the TARDIS had to crash through the wall and thus the set had to be destroyed with an <b>air</b> <b>cannon.</b> The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland was the inspiration for the design of the Teselecta corridors.|$|E

2500|$|As {{was common}} with inclement conditions, the game {{featured}} many punts {{and very few}} passes. The teams combined for 274 yards {{on the ground and}} only 73 yards in the <b>air.</b> <b>Cannon</b> was the game's leading rusher with 53 yards on thirteen carries, but he also fumbled twice, both times deep in LSU territory. [...] "We had to wait for the rain to stop before we went out and warm up," [...] Cannon remembered, [...] "and when it finally quit raining, things weren't much better. They had these plank bridges over pools of water and slop to get you onto the field." [...] His first fumble came in the first quarter at the LSU twenty, but the Bandits were able to hold Mississippi State to a missed field goal attempt. His second fumble was in the fourth quarter at the 13, and the Tigers again were able to hold the Maroons to a missed field goal.|$|E

50|$|Teams {{competed in}} the {{following}} divisions: <b>Air</b> <b>Cannon,</b> Female <b>Air</b> <b>Cannon,</b> Centrifugal, Catapult, Torsion, Trebuchet, Human Powered, Centrifugal Human Powered, Youth <b>Air</b> <b>Cannon,</b> Youth Catapult, Youth Trebuchet, Youth Human Powered, Youth 10 & Under, and Theatrical. Each division competed strictly for distance except for the Theatrical division which relies on a fan vote. The teams get three shots, one taken on each of three consecutive days. Only a team's longest shot is scored for official results. Spotters riding on ATVs find the impact point, and then a professional surveyor calculates the distance based on GPS coordinates of the impact and the machine. The impact point is marked with color-coded spray paint.|$|E
