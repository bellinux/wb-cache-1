40|$|Transient <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> are {{striking}} clinical phenomena that are commonly encountered by physicians in acute medical settings. Diagnosis of such syndromes can be challenging, and their causes have been debated for over 50 years. Critical clinical distinctions, such as between transient global amnesia (TGA) and transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), {{as well as}} important clues to the underlying pathophysiology, have recently been revealed. TGA {{is characterized by the}} sudden onset of a profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia that lasts for up to 24 h, with neuroimaging after an acute TGA event showing transient perturbation of specific hippocampal circuits that are involved in memory processing. Some cases of transient amnesia are attributable to focal seizure activity and are termed TEA, which has a clinical presentation similar to that of TGA, but can be distinguished from the latter by the brevity and frequency of amnesic attacks. Moreover, TEA carries a risk of persistent memory impairment that can be mistaken for dementia. Here, we summarize clinically relevant aspects of transient <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> giving practical recommendations for diagnosis and patient management.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the anterograde <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> associated with diencephalic and temporal lobe pathology is examined {{in the light of}} recent findings. It is proposed that a common feature of anterograde amnesia is damage to part of an âextended hippocampal systemâ comprising the hippocampus, the fornix, the mammillary bodies, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. Damage to this system results in deficits in the recall of episodic information, the core symptom of anterograde amnesia. In contrast, lesions in this system need not disrupt tests of recognition memory when they primarily tax familiarity judgements. It is assumed that familiarity judgements depend on other regions (e. g. the rhinal cortex in the case of temporal lobe amnesia) and that the extended hippocampal system is principally involved in those aspects of recognition that are retrieval-based rather than familiarity-based. These proposals arise from new evidence on the performance of delayed nonmatching-to-sample by animals, from a meta-analysis of the performance of amnesic subjects on a test of recognition memory, and from new research into the pattern of connections between the medial temporal lobe and the medial diencephalon in primates...|$|R
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of anterograde <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{varies with}} the extent of damage and the regions {{of the brain that}} were damaged. The most well-described regions indicated in this disorder are the medial temporal lobe (MTL), basal forebrain, and fornix. Beyond the details described below, the precise process of how we rememberâ on a micro scaleâ remains a mystery. Neuropsychologists and scientists are still not in total agreement over whether forgetting is due to faulty encoding, accelerated forgetting, or faulty retrieval, although a great deal of data seem to point to the encoding hypothesis. In addition, neuroscientists are also in disagreement about the length of time involved in memory consolidation. Though most researchers, including Hasselmo et al., have found the consolidation process is spread out over several hours before transitioning from a fragile to a more permanent state, others, including Brown et al., posit that memory consolidation can take months or even years in a drawn-out process of consolidation and reinforcement. Further research into the length of time of memory consolidation will shed more light on why anterograde amnesia sometimes affects some memories gained after the event(s) that caused the amnesia, but does not affect other such memories.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{human brain}} has evolved the {{capacity}} for language not only through specific mechanisms of routinized articulation of speech patterns, but through general mechanisms of adaptive memory organization. As shown by <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> in humans and animals, the consolidation of memory requires neural traffic between localized neocortical networks, specialized for sensory or motor articulation, and the more diffuse, densely-interconnected limbic networks {{at the core of}} the brain. The connectivity of limbic networks allows not only the integration of widespread cortical regions, but the recruitment of subcortical motivational systems. A cognitive representation, such as supports the understanding of a word, is thus multileveled, with four or five discrete network levels in the pathway linking limbic (visceral) with neocortical (sensorimotor articulation) representations. Through their influences on subcortical arousal systems, the limbic networks provide motivational control over the consolidation process. Through reentrant corticolimbic traffic, language appears to be articulated in neocortical networks through a microdevelopmental process that begins in the prelinguistic, syncretic, postural-affective matrix of felt emotional significance represented at the limbic core of the brain. In its fundamental architecture, meaning is thus embodied. On the other hand, conscious realization of meaning may require the differentiation of specific form out of the syncretic paralimbic matrix, and this realizatio...|$|R
40|$|Two {{principal}} {{arguments against}} a consolidation-block formulation of anterograde amnesia are {{the existence of}} pnor-list intrusion errors and the facilitating effect of cued recall Both of these findings can be explained if one assumes an additional process trace activation of already existing memories. This consolidation-block plus trace-activation view predicts that in densely amnesic patients, learning of new items or relationships {{is almost impossible to}} demonstrate and cued recall facilitates performance only on already familiar material We test for trace activation by comparing the performance of six dense anterograde amnesia patients with control subjects on three tasks arbitrary word-paired associates (e. g., late-man), recall of disyllabic words cued with the first syllable (e. g., per-son), and recall of disyllabic pseudowords cued with the first syllable (e. g., com-da). As predicted, amnesic patients showed substantial cued-recall effects for real words and not for pseudowords or arbitrarily paired associates The effect of the cuemg on real words was demonstrated to decay over approximately 120 mm, providing some estimate of the time course of trace activation The central features of <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> are a severe loss of recall of postmorbid (recent) long-term memories and a loss of a feeling of familiarity about recently experienced events, concurrent with what may be normal shortterm memory and intelligence (Korsakoff...|$|R
40|$|Extensive neural {{connections}} between the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and the hippocampal system may explain the overlapping <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> associated with diencephalic and medial temporal lobe brain injury. Despite the debilitating nature of the diencephalic amnesia, treatments for this condition are lacking. In rats, lesions to the ATN or hippocampus generally produce similar memory deficits, which further implicate these structures in a single functional memory system. First evidence is presented here that seemingly permanent and robust spatial working memory deficits seen after lesions to the ATN in rats are ameliorated by environmental intervention and pharmacological treatment. Post-operative housing of ATN-lesioned rats for 30 days in enriched environment resulted in marked improvements in performance on the spatial working memory task in the cross-maze irrespective of whether rats were exposed to enrichment immediately after surgery or enrichment was delayed by 40 days post-surgery. Long-term beneficial effects of enrichment were also demonstrated. Behavioural improvements were observed when Cerebrolysin - a neurotrophic compound - was injected intraperitoneally for 30 days post-surgery. The combination of enrichment and Cerebrolysin treatment was more effective in inducing recovery on a delayed memory test in the cross-maze task. The influence of enrichment and Cerebrolysin on the neural changes produced by ATN lesions was examined utilising an immediate early gene marker c-fos. Replicating previous studies, ATN lesions produced marked hypoactivity in the retrosplenial cortex, but this effect was not reversed by either enrichment or Cerebrolysin. Unexpectedly, enrichment produced further hypoactivation in this region. Although lesion-induced deficits in a radial-arm maze spatial discrimination task were not improved by enrichment, a related study in our laboratory showed that spatial reference memory can also be improved by enrichment in ATN rats.

40|$|Emotions are {{ubiquitous}} in everyday life, and {{can often be}} re-experienced accurately after long periods. Emotions also have a strong mutual influence on other memory systems (most notably episodic memory), but rely on different neuroanatomical structures, and can function independently â often reported in amnesic patients. However, unlike episodic memory, many fundamental questions about the structure of emotions remain unresolved. The two most influential accounts of the organisation of affect (the dimensional and categorical theories) are surprisingly divergent, an issue not addressed {{by the fact that}} emotion memory studies tend to be based on two rather than many emotion categories. Moreover, the field lacks sophisticated empirical tools for analysing discrete emotions, and calculating their specificity. Using a novel set of controlled emotional stories, the present thesis investigated the re-experience of four discrete classes of emotion (anger, fear, sadness, and happiness) in three samples: neurologically-normal participants (N= 32), Korsakoffâs syndrome patients (N= 20), and age-matched controls (N= 20). The results suggest that: (1) The most durable form of emotional memory encodes affective valence. Discrete emotions can be reliably re-experienced, but require stronger forms of emotion elicitation than valence. (2) Remarkably, severely <b>amnesic</b> Korsakoffâs <b>syndrome</b> patients show a preserved ability to re-experience discrete emotions, at similar levels of intensity to neurologically-normal age-matched controls. Furthermore, the intensity of discrete emotions, in patients and controls, appears to be related to core executive functions; (3) Using a novel methodological approach, {{it is clear that the}} brief experience of certain discrete emotions (e. g., happiness) also increases the specificity of other emotions (e. g., anger and fear). Thus, the present thesis provides a unique attempt to reconcile the dimensional and categorical theories of emotions, and allows the investigation of specific basic emotions, while accounting for the experience of other basic emotions...|$|R
40|$|IN 1957 we {{described}} an unusual form of confusion occurring {{for a short}} period in patients immediately after anterior cingulectomy (Whitty and Lewin, 1957).

We found no evidence of this condition post-operatively in removal of cerebral tissue, either for trauma or tumour, from other sites. However, a confusional state for temporal sequence and some change in the patient's awareness of himself has been noted following leucotomy and other operations on the frontal lobes. We could not therefore exclude the possibility that what we had noted represented the effects of damage {{to other parts of the}} frontal lobes rather than specifically of the limited anterior cingulate area. Since then a further 14 of our patients have undergone cingulectomy: 10 of them for severe obsessional states, 3 for intractable aggressive outbursts with mental defect or temporal lobe epilepsy (following Le â¢Beau's (1953) reports of benefit in these conditions) and one for schizo-phrenia with severe tension. Of these, 2 were not fully examined in the early post-operative period: and a further two were unsuitable witnesses for such an examination because of mental defect.
