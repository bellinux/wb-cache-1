25|$|Despite <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> she received, Cliff was {{actually}} quite camera shy, {{and in most}} cases the images of her pottery were what dominated the women's magazine of the day. One picture which shows Cliff informally was taken when a South African stockist of her ware, from Werner Brothers, visited the factory on a buying trip. Cliff is seen with the 3-year-old daughter and wife of the stockist. After the visit Cliff sent the daughter a present of a miniature child's tea set painted in her Honolulu pattern.|$|E

In his first letter, Christopher included {{a picture that}} he had taken of the town, taken near the place that McNair was arrested. He told McNair that he hoped the Campbellton Chamber of Commerce would write a cheque to McNair for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> he had brought to the town, and wrote to McNair about the recent World Series and federal election. Christopher included three American dollars in order {{to cover the cost of}} paper and postage; the prison returned his money.|$|E
25|$|The {{women are}} invited to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in Los Angeles. While there, {{tensions}} arise between Chris and Annie. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding the calendar has taken a toll on their personal lives, and they lash out {{at each other in}} angry frustration. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the Mother Teresa-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life as it was before they removed their clothing.|$|E

25|$|On November 2, 1923 (21 {{months after}} Taylor's murder) Gibson {{was arrested at}} her home at 2324 North Beachwood Drive, Los Angeles, California on federal felony charges {{involving}} an alleged nationwide blackmail and extortion ring. She was subsequently charged with extortion and violation of Section 145 of the Federal Criminal Code. George W. Lasher told authorities he had paid Gibson $1155 to avoid prosecution for a reputed violation of the Mann Act. Gibson was also said {{to be connected to}} two convicted blackmailers who had pleaded guilty the preceding week to extorting $10,000 from Ohio banker John L. Bushnell. Amid <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> following her arrest she was mentioned as both Margaret Gibson and Patricia Palmer. The charges were later dropped by the district attorney's office. Over the next six years she worked sporadically in bit parts and minor supporting roles but the industry's transition to sound film saw the end of Gibson's already thwarted career.|$|E

[...] Bell later recalled: [...] "Those two games against Ohio State were my biggest, and I consider the second game a personal victory.

On 3 April, they {{played for the}} first time at the Nashville, supporting the 101ers. The pub rock group's lead singer, Joe Strummer, saw the Pistols {{for the first time}} that night—and recognised punk rock as the future. A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April demonstrated the band's growing musical competence, but by all accounts lacked a spark. Westwood provided that by instigating a fight with another audience member; McLaren and Rotten were soon involved in the melee. Cook later said, [...] "That fight at the Nashville: that's when <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> got hold of it and the violence started creeping in.... I think everybody was ready to go and we were the catalyst." [...] The Pistols were soon banned from both the Nashville and the Marquee.|$|E

500|$|On October 27, {{the defense}} {{attorneys}} again said {{that they wanted to}} move the venue for the trial outside Cameron County because of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> the case had received. They claimed it was impossible to select an impartial jury in Brownsville because of the amount of information the press had released against the defendants. The judge said he would announce his decision on November 2. On the same day, a grand jury reindicted Cisneros and Martínez on capital murder. Prosecutors had presented the evidence to a second grand jury and issued a revised indictment. A clear distinction {{between the first and second}} indictment was the change of the word [...] "caused" [...] to [...] "committed". Because a new indictment was issued, Cisneros, Martínez, and Garza pleaded not-guilty for a second time, forcing the court proceedings to be pushed back from their original dates. A pretrial hearing scheduled for November 2 dlayed. At least 42 motions were filed by the defendants when the first indictment was made, and the second indictment meant that they had to refile all the motions by November 12.|$|E

[...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E
2500|$|Britney Spears is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, and {{occasional}} author. The documentary reveals Spears' most intimate {{moments in the}} span of 60 days, from the beginning of her much publicized meltdown, until how she returned to the music spotlight.

[...] She explains that going through her first break-up, with boyfriend Justin Timberlake, in the spotlight was no easy task for a teenage girl. [...] She felt that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> made it even more difficult and confusing for her to move on {{at such a young age}} and so she began to act out. [...] Her break-up with husband and father of her two sons, Kevin Federline, was even worse she explains.

2500|$|On 14 May 2009, Baillie was a {{guest on}} the BBC {{politics}} and current affairs programme This Week.

Asked by Neil if receiving an apology from Brand and Ross had mattered to her, she said yes, as she had been [...] "publicly offended and humiliated", and her father [...] "had been humiliated too". When asked by Abbott if <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding the Brand row had helped her career, she responded [...] "not necessarily ... one would think so, but not really." [...] Neil further asked if the apology she received had helped, she replied yes, stating [...] "definitely" [...] to the follow-up comment from Neil of [...] "better to get it than not get it?" [...] When asked finally on the row by Neil if she thought the apologies from Brand and Ross were genuine, she replied that she thought Ross's was, but the fact that Brand had joked about the row on his later tour negated his apology.|$|E

He'd like to publish 'Every Other Week' on the sly; keep it out of the papers, and off the newsstands; he's a modest Boston petunia, and he shrinks from publicity; but I am not that kind of herb myself, and I want <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> we can get--beg, borrow, or steal--for this thing. I say that you can't work the sacred rites of hospitality in a better cause, and what I propose is a little dinner for the purpose of recognizing the hit we've made with this thing. My idea was to strike you for the necessary funds, and do the thing on a handsome scale. The term little dinner is a mere figure of speech. A little dinner wouldn't make a big talk, and what we want is the big talk, at present, if we don't lay up a cent. My notion was that pretty soon after Lent, now, when everybody is feeling just right, we should begin to send out our paragraphs, affirmative, negative, and explanatory, and along about the first of May we should sit down about a hundred strong, the most distinguished people in the country, and solemnize our triumph. There it is in a nutshell. I might expand and I might expound, but that's the sum and substance of it." ...|$|E
