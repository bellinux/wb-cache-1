5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E
5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> {{his knees and}} his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, {{was traded to the}} Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The PS4 {{version of}} Leifthrasir {{received}} an aggregate score of 87/100 based on 49 reviews, becoming the 15th best-reviewed title of 2016. The Vita version received {{a score of}} 93/100 based on five reviews. Reviewing Leifthrasir, Famitsu praised the increased smoothness and battle frequency, noting that the title still felt fresh despite being the remake of a 2007 title. They also praised the graphical upgrade <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the artwork. Critics generally agreed that Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its technical performance, lack of the original's framerate problems, graphical upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus {{by the appearance of}} a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{appears in}} several StarCraft novels that greatly expand her backstory {{before the first}} StarCraft game. The novel Uprising portrays Kerrigan's {{training}} as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected to intense psychological abuse from her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When {{she was a young}} girl, an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a vegetative state. Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm's demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels Liberty's Crusade and Queen of Blades provide novelisations for Kerrigan's actions in Episodes I and II of StarCraft respectively. Liberty's Crusade develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while Queen of Blades serves to demonstrate Kerrigan's complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> her former love, Raynor.|$|E

5|$|Lighting <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> characters' {{skin was}} of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, {{with a lot of}} work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E
