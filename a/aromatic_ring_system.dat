25|$|The general {{principle}} is outlined in scheme 1. An <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> with a DMG group 1 interacts with an alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium in its specific aggregation state (hence (R-Li)n) to intermediate 2 since the hetero atom on the DMG is a Lewis base and lithium the Lewis acid. The very basic alkyllithium then deprotonates the {{ring in the}} nearest ortho- position forming the aryllithium 3 all the while maintaining the acid-base interaction. An electrophile reacts in the next phase in an electrophilic aromatic substitution with a strong preference for the lithium ipso position replacing the lithium atom.|$|E

2500|$|... 2-Iodomelatonin was {{synthesized}} in 1986 and its radioligand, 2--melatonin, {{has been}} useful in finding cellular targets of melatonin. Though the melatonin receptor wasn’t characterized and cloned {{in the human}} being until 1994 {{it was possible to}} start carrying out binding studies in various tissues before that time. As mentioned in the structure-activity relationship chapter above, certain groups are important for the activity. The most important groups are the 5-methoxy group and the acylaminoethyl side-chain, because they bind to and activate the receptors. The –NH group of the indole ring is not important for binding and activation. Therefore it is possible to replace it with other aromatic ring systems. The aromatic ring and the ethyl side-chain hold the correct distance between those two groups. The correct distance is the key to good binding and more important than what type of <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> the analogue contains. Therefore it is possible to use different ring systems in melatonin receptor analogues, if the distance is right.|$|E
50|$|Both the phenyl and the naphthanol {{group are}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>systems.</b> The sp2 hybridized {{nitrogen}} {{atoms in the}} azo group have a p-orbital that share a pair of π-electrons which connect the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> to form a fully conjugated system. This conjugation allows the molecule to absorb light in the visible range, thus making it useful as a dye, with longer conjugated systems absorbing longer wavelengths of light.|$|R

2500|$|FAD can {{be reduced}} to FADH2 through by the {{addition}} of two H+ and two e−. FADH2 can also be oxidized by the loss of one H+ and one e− to form FADH. The FAD form can be recreated from another loss on one H+ and one e−. FAD formation can also occur through the reduction and dehydration of flavin-N(5)-oxide. Based on the oxidation state, flavins take specific colors when in aqueous solution. [...] flavin-N(5)-oxide (superoxidized) is yellow-orange, FAD (fully oxidized) is yellow, FADH (half reduced) is either blue or red based on the pH, and the fully reduced form is colorless. Changing the form can have a large impact on other chemical properties. For example, FAD, the fully oxidized form is subject to nucleophilic attack, the fully reduced form, [...] FADH2 has high polarizability, while the half reduced form is unstable in aqueous solution. FAD is an <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> whereas FADH2 is not. This means that FADH2 is significantly higher in energy, without the stabilization through resonance that the aromatic structure provides. [...] FADH2 is an energy-carrying molecule, because, once oxidized it regains aromaticity and releases the energy represented by this stabilization.|$|E

The halogen dance concept can be extended from benzene derivatives to other aromatic systems as well, for instance furan and thiophenecompounds.|$|E

40|$|The {{flexibility}} of individual amino acid side chains of pancreatic phospholipase A 2 in aqueous and micellar solutions was studied with deuterium {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (2 H NMR). Bovine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 was selectively deuterated at the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> of Trp- 3 and Phe- 5 and porcine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 at Trp- 3 only. Solid-state 2 H NMR spectra of the lyophilized enzymes exhibited quadrupole splittings {{on the order of}} 130 kHz, indicating almost complete immobilization of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>systems.</b> Exposure to a water-saturated atmosphere did not remove these steric constraints. However, side-chain mobility could be induced for the tryptophyl residue of the bovine enzyme by dissolving this enzyme in aqueous buffer or micellar solution whereas the phenyl ring always remained immobile and served as a probe for the protein's overall rotation. Typical correlation times for the tryptophyl and phenyl <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> in aqueous solution were 7 ps and 13 ns (at 20 degrees C), respectively. The correlation time of the phenyl ring was longer than expected for the monomeric protein (approximately 6 ns), suggesting some aggregation of the protein at the high concentrations used for the NMR measurements. Addition of a micellar solution of oleoylphosphocholine had no influence on the motional freedom of the tryptophyl residue but approximately doubled the correlation time of the phenyl ring, indicating an increase of the effective volume of the tumbling particle due to lipid-protein interaction.
