5|$|Fraud in the naturalization process. Technically, {{this is not}} a loss of {{citizenship}} but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant never was <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|To have {{qualified}} for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. He must be <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation, and be {{under the jurisdiction of}} that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating {{for the first time in}} an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.|$|E
5|$|Henry Sue, a voter from Queensland, {{disputed the}} {{election}} of Hill and filed a petition under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in the High Court of Australia, sitting in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. Sue argued that on the date of Hill's nomination to the Senate she was still <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom and thus, because of the operation of section 44 of the Australian Constitution, was ineligible to be elected to the Parliament of Australia.|$|E

5|$|After Homer sees how devastated Apu {{was about}} being deported, he changes {{his mind about}} the {{immigration}} proposition and vows {{that he and his}} family will help Apu. Lisa discovers that Apu will not have to leave if he can pass a United States citizenship test. Homer agrees to be Apu's tutor to help prepare for the exam. After Lisa intervenes, Apu goes to take the test; he passes and becomes <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests how terrible it would be if immigrants were deported, explaining they make the United States thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes, with 95% of voters voting yes. After the ballot is passed, the only person deported is Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E
5|$|As the despot of Valona, John {{established}} commercial {{ties with}} Venice and Ragusa, {{and he became}} <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former in 1353. After the death of Dušan in 1355, he took {{the side of the}} unsuccessful Simeon Uroš in the ensuing conflict for the Serbian throne. With Venetian assistance, John maintained the essentially independent status of the Principality of Valona. He probably died of the plague in 1363 and he was succeeded by Alexander Komnenos Asen, who was likely his son from his unknown first wife. John's second marriage was to the former Epirote queen-consort Anna Palaiologina.|$|E

5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle {{to the children of}} foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E
5|$|To become {{governor}} of Indiana, a candidate must be <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States {{and must have}} been a resident of the state in which they are running for the period of five consecutive years before the election. The candidate must also be at least 30 years old when sworn into office. The governor may not hold any other state or federal office during his term and must resign from any such position before being eligible to be sworn in as governor. Before taking the office, the candidate must swear an oath of office administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana, promising to uphold the Constitution and laws of the state.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state {{for at least two years}} prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve as long as one who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E

5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP.

Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified.

5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the compliment by registering in France as <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and {{the states of the}} former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with the official Soviet concept of art.|$|E
