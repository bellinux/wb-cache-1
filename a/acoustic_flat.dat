50|$|Production tenor guitars by Gibson and Martin {{from the}} 1940s to the 1960s are still {{generally}} available, such as Gibson's ETG-150 electric/acoustic archtop tenor guitar and Martin's 0-18T <b>acoustic</b> <b>flat</b> top tenor guitar. Original tenor guitars {{in good condition}} {{by any of the}} major guitar makers are considered very desirable, either as instruments for playing, or as interesting collectibles in their own right. Some specially ordered custom tenor guitar models from makers, such as Gibson, can be extremely rare since only one of the particular model may only have been manufactured. As noted above, in the pre-WW2 period, Gibson offered either the tenor or plectrum guitar version of any model they made at no extra cost to the purchaser.|$|E

This metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies. Our experiment shows the promise of designing compact and light-weight ultrasound imaging elements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flat affect was {{examined}} across multiple contexts (during interviews and emotional films), multiple channels of expression (facial and vocal), and different assessment techniques (clinical ratings, observational ratings of facial expression, and acoustic analyses) in 23 medication-free schizophrenic patients. Patients participated {{in three different}} interviews during which either clinical ratings were made or their voices were audiotaped for later acoustic analyses. Patients were also videotaped while they viewed positive and negative emotional films. The videotapes were then coded for the frequency, intensity, and duration {{of positive and negative}} facial expressions. Results indicated that general clinical ratings were related across different interviews. However, only those items specific to affective flattening bore significant relationships to vocal and facial expressiveness. Vocal expressiveness and negative facial expressiveness were related, but vocal expressiveness was not related to positive facial expressiveness. Key Words.

40|$|We {{design a}} flat sub-wavelength lens that can focus {{acoustic}} wave. We analytically study the transmission through an acoustic grating with curled slits, which {{can serve as}} a material with tunable impedance and refractive index for acoustic waves. The effective parameters rely on the geometry of the slits and are independent of frequency. A <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> focusing lens by such acoustic grating with gradient effective refractive index is designed. The focusing effect is clearly observed in simulations and well predicted by the theory. We demonstrate that despite the large impedance mismatch between the acoustic lens and the matrix, the intensity at the focal point is still high due to Fabry-Perot resonance...|$|R

(This theory does not hold where the fire separation fails, as happened in the Grenfell Tower fire). Without fire separation it would be necessary for all people above a fire to escape, which would not be possible using the existing narrow staircases.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effect of}} basis selection on geometric nonlinear response prediction using a reduced-order nonlinear modal simulation is presented. The accuracy is dictated by the selection of the basis used to determine the nonlinear modal stiffness.

The nonlinear modal simulation presented is broadly applicable and is demonstrated for nonlinear quasi-static and random <b>acoustic</b> response of <b>flat</b> beam and plate structures with isotropic material properties. Reduced-order analysis predictions are compared with those made using a numerical simulation in physical degrees-of-freedom to quantify the error associated with the selected modal bases.

40|$|Optimum {{placement}} of multiple traditional piezoceramic actuators is determined for active structural <b>acoustic</b> control of <b>flat</b> panels. The structural acoustic response is determined using acoustic radiation filters and structural surface vibration characteristics. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control is utilized {{to determine the}} optimum state feedback gain for active structural acoustic control. The optimum actuator location is determined by minimizing the structural acoustic radiated noise using a modified genetic algorithm. Experimental tests are conducted and compared to analytical results. Anisotropic piezoceramic actuators exhibit enhanced performance when compared to traditional isotropic piezoceramic actuators. As {{a result of the}} inherent isotropy, these advanced actuators develop strain along the principal material axis. The orientation of anisotropic actuators is investigated on the effect of structural vibration and acoustic control of curved and flat panels.

40|$|A new {{acoustic}} actuator {{is designed}} and optimised {{to be used}} for active noise control. The active element is a <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> actuator, consisting of two PVDF elements bonded on a honeycomb structure, and driven in opposite phase. The actuator can be useful in many applications. One of these, as illustrated in this article, is an active control system, designed to increase the sound transmission loss through a single panel partition in the low frequency range. Simulations make use of an analytical model for the actuator, for the fluid-structure coupled model, and for the controller. The transmission loss can be increased considerably below 250 Hz, and with a small modification to the actuator, the system can increase the transmission loss up to 500 Hz. Special attention is paid to a configuration suitable for an industrial application of this control technique, where the actuator is shielded from the environment by the passive plate, and using accelerometers on the passive plate as error sensors. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design, {{implementation}} and detailed performance analysis {{for a class}} of trapeziform and <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> cloaks. An effective large invisible area is obtained compared with the traditional carpet cloak. The cloaks are realized with homogeneous metamaterials which are made of periodic arrangements of subwavelength unit cells composed of steel embedded in air. The microstructures and its effective parameters of the cloaks are determined quickly and precisely in a broadband frequency range by using the effective medium theory and the proposed parameters optimization method. The invisibility capability of the cloaks can be controlled by the variation of the key design parameters and scale factor which are proved to have more influence on the performance in the near field than that in the far field. Different designs are suitable for different application situations. Good cloaking performance demonstrates that such a device can be physically realized with natural materials which will greatly promote the real applications of invisibility cloak...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} is {{a method}} of obtaining a virtual shot gather from a collection of physical shot gathers. The set of traces corresponding to two common receiver gathers from many physical shots is used to synthesize a virtual shot located {{at one of the}} receivers and a virtual receiver at the other. An estimate of a Green's function between these two receivers is obtained by first cross-correlating corresponding pairs of traces from each of the shots and then stacking the resulting cross-correlograms. In this paper, we study the structure of cross-correlograms obtained from a VSP acquisition geometry using surface sources and down-hole receivers. The model is purely <b>acoustic</b> and contains <b>flat</b> or dipping layers and/or point inclusions that act as di ffractors. Results of a semblance-based moveout scan of the cross-correlograms are used to identify the potential geometry of the reflectors. This new information allows improvements in the quality of the trace at the virtual receiver by either rejecting those moveouts or enhancing them before the stack is performed.

40|$|Modeling and {{experimental}} {{results of an}} ultrasonic aperiodic flat lens for use in air are presented. Predictive modeling of the lens is performed using a hybrid genetic-greedy algorithm constrained to a linear structure. The optimized design parameters are used to fabricate a lens. A method combining a fiber-disk arrangement and scanning laser vibrometer measurements is developed to characterize the acoustic field distribution generated by the lens. The focal spot size is determined to be 0. 88 of the incident wavelength of 8090 kHz {{at a distance of}} 2. 5 mm from the lens. Theoretically computed field distributions, optimized frequency of operation, and spatial resolution focal length are compared with experimental measurements. The differences between experimental measurements and the theoretical computations are analyzed. The theoretical calculation of the focal spot diameter is 1. 7 mm which is 48 % of the experimental measurement at a frequency of 80 – 90 kHz. This work illustrates the capabilities of a hybrid algorithm approach to design of <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> lenses to operate in air with a resolution of greater than the incident wavelength and the challenges of characterizing acoustic field distribution in air...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using piezoelectric polymer material (PVDF) as sensor and actuator material in active noise control applications. Three different active panels based on PVDF material are designed and tested. The first panel is a loudspeaker panel that produces a relatively high sound power output at low frequencies. Secondly a smart foam was built with the PVDF material integrated in the passive polyurethane foam. The third panel is a volume velocity sensor/actuator panel that controls the volume velocity through a panel. Finally some tests were performed with the EMFi <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> actuator. Numerical and analytical models are developed to optimise {{the performance of the}} active panels in various configurations. Experiments in a car with the active panels show a substantial reduction of the sound pressure level. A second test is the active control of sound transmission through a single panel partition according to the ISO 140 standard, using the active panels. The tests show an increase in the sound transmission loss of 3 dB to 6 dB below 300 Hz, which is the frequency region where the passive sound transmission loss of a single panel partition is insufficient. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} second kind integral equations of {{the form}} x(s) - (abbreviated x - K x = y), in which Ω is some unbounded subset of Rn. Let Xp denote the weighted space of functions x continuous on Ω and satisfying x (s) = O(|s|-p),s → ∞We show that if the kernel k(s,t) decays like |s — t|-q as |s — t| → ∞ for some sufficiently large q (and some other mild conditions on k are satisfied), then K ∈ B(XP) (the set of bounded linear operators on Xp), for 0 ≤ p ≤ q. If also (I - K) - 1 ∈ B(X 0) then (I - K) - 1 ∈ B(XP) for 0 < p < q, and (I- K) - 1 ∈ B(Xq) if further conditions on k hold. Thus, if k(s, t) = O(|s — t|-q). |s — t| → ∞, and y(s) =O(|s|-p), s → ∞, the asymptotic behaviour of the solution x may be estimated as x (s) = O(|s|-r), |s| → ∞, r := min(p, q). The case when k(s,t) = к(s — t), so that the equation is of Wiener-Hopf type, receives especial attention. Conditions, {{in terms of the}} symbol of I — K, for I — K to be invertible or Fredholm on Xp are established for certain cases (Ω a half-space or cone). A boundary integral equation, which models three-dimensional <b>acoustic</b> propaga-tion above <b>flat</b> ground, absorbing apart from an infinite rigid strip, illustrates the practical application and sharpness of the above results. This integral equation mod-els, in particular, road traffic noise propagation along an infinite road surface sur-rounded by absorbing ground.

40|$|System in {{the form}} of a {{circular}} cylindrical piezoceramic transducer near a <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> screen was analyzed. The aim of the work was to solve the problem of receiving plane sound waves by «cylindrical piezoceramic transducer – flat acoustically soft screen» system. Considered system was characterized by a violation of the radial symmetry of the radiation load of the transducer while maintaining the radial symmetry of the electric load. At the same time, the energy perceived by the system under consideration is distributed between all modes of oscillation of the transducer, while the conversion of mechanical energy into electric is realized only at zero mole of oscillations. Special attention was paid to the method of coupled fields in multiply connected domains using the imaging method. The design model of the «transducer–creen» system was formulated taking into account the interaction of acoustic, mechanical and electric fields in the process of energy conversion, the interaction of a cylindrical transducer with a flat screen and the interaction of a converter with elastic media outside and inside it. The physical fields of the system under consideration were determined by following solutions: the wave equation; equations of motion of thin piezoceramic cylindrical shells in displacements; equations of stimulated electrostatics for piezoceramics for given boundary conditions, conditions for coupling fields at interfaces and electrical conditions. A general conclusion was made concerning solving of an infinite system of linear algebraic equations with respect to the unknown coefficients of the expansion of the fields. As an example of the application of the obtained relations, a calculation was made and an analysis of the dependences of the electric fields of the system under consideration for various parameters of its construction on the direction of arrival on the plane wave system was conducted. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosion}} {{of interest in}} metamaterials {{is due to the}} dramatically increased manipulation ability over light as well as sound waves. This material research was stimulated by the opportunity to develop an artificial media with negative refractive index and the application in superlens which allows super-resolution imaging. High-resolution acoustic imaging techniques are the essential tools for nondestructive testing and medical screening. However, the spatial resolution of the conventional acoustic imaging methods is restricted by the incident wavelength of ultrasound. This is due to the quickly fading evanescent fields which carry the subwavelength features of objects. By focusing the propagating wave and recovering the evanescent field, a flat lens with negative-index can potentially overcome the diffraction limit. We present the first experimental demonstration of focusing ultrasound waves through a <b>flat</b> <b>acoustic</b> metamaterial lens composed of a planar network of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. We observed a tight focus of half-wavelength in width at 60. 5 KHz by imaging a point source. This result is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation by transmission line model in which we derived the effective mass density and compressibility. This metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies. Our experiment shows the promise of designing compact and light-weight ultrasound imaging elements. Moreover, the concept of metamaterial extends far beyond negative refraction, rather giving enormous choice of material parameters for different applications. One of the most interesting examples these years is the invisible cloak. Such a device is proposed to render the hidden object undetectable under the flow of light or sound, by guiding and controlling the wave path through an engineered space surrounding the object. However, the cloak designed by transformation optics usually calls for a highly anisotropic metamaterial, which make the experimental studies remain challenging. We present here the first practical realization of a low-loss and broadband acoustic cloak for underwater ultrasound. This metamaterial cloak is constructed with a network of acoustic circuit elements, namely serial inductors and shunt capacitors. Our experiment clearly shows that the acoustic cloak can effectively bend the ultrasound waves around the hidden object, with reduced scattering and shadow. Due to the non-resonant nature of the building elements, this low loss (~ 6 dB/m) cylindrical cloak exhibits excellent invisibility over a broad frequency range from 52 to 64 kHz in the measurements. The low visibility of the cloaked object for underwater ultrasound shed a light on the fundamental understanding of manipulation, storage and control of acoustic waves. Furthermore, our experimental study indicates that this design approach should be scalable to different acoustic frequencies and offers the possibility for a variety of devices based on coordinate transformation...|$|R
