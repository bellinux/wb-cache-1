5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> married {{for more than a}} year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E

25|$|Anyone {{aware of}} having {{committed}} a grave sin {{is obliged to}} refrain from receiving Communion without first obtaining absolution in the sacrament of Reconciliation. In addition, canon 1331 §1 of the Code of Canon Law forbids an excommunicated person, even one who has incurred a latae sententiae (automatic) excommunication, from receiving Holy Communion or any other of the sacraments of the Catholic Church. Also forbidden to receive the sacraments is <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> interdicted. These rules concern {{a person who is}} considering whether to receive Holy Communion, and in this way differ from the rule of canon 915, which concerns instead a person who administers the sacrament to others.|$|E

500|$|In the {{emergency}} setting, <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> subjected to forces {{strong enough to}} cause SCI is treated as though they have instability in the spinal column and is immobilized to prevent damage to the spinal cord. Injuries or fractures in the head, neck, or pelvis as well as penetrating trauma near the spine and falls from heights {{are assumed to be}} associated with an unstable spinal column until it is ruled out in the hospital. High-speed vehicle crashes, sports injuries involving the head or neck, and diving injuries are other mechanisms that indicate a high SCI risk. Since head and spinal trauma frequently coexist, anyone who is unconscious or has a lowered level of consciousness {{as a result of a}} head injury is immobilized.|$|E
500|$|Jacobs won the [...] "Best Emerging Talent" [...] {{accolade}} at the 2005 Screen Nation Awards for {{her role}} as Donna. She was also nominated for the [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] award at the 2004 National Television Awards, and the [...] "Favourite Female TV Star" [...] Screen Nation award in 2008. Discussing public reaction to her character, Jacobs stated that real nurses enjoyed her [...] "man-eating antics", and were envious that Donna got away with wearing so much make-up. She commented, [...] "I've never met <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> sensitive about Donna throwing herself at men. The women I meet seem to appreciate her tactics." [...] In the aftermath of the Donna/Mickie storyline, the BBC banned its actresses from appearing in raunchy photo-shoots, after Jacobs and Adams were photographed in intimate poses while dressed in nurses uniforms for various [...] "lads' mags".|$|E
500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{was seen}} by 18.24million viewers. It earned an 18 rating, which {{represents}} the percentage of television-equipped homes, and a 31 share, which represents percentage of sets in use. This marked the best ratings performance of a preview or premiere following a Super Bowl since The Wonder Years in 1988. It was also the largest viewership of the first season, in large part due to its 10:25p.m. time-slot immediately following the Super Bowl. Nevertheless, NBC considered it a disappointing performance, based {{on the amount of}} advertising and press coverage the episode received. [...] The episode received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did. Levinson later said the Super Bowl crowd might not have been perfectly suited to Homicide: Life on the Street. In particular, regarding the episode's complex story lines and distinctive visual style, he said, [...] "I imagine <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> drinking a lot at a Super Bowl party might have trouble following the show." ...|$|E

50|$|The Act {{contained}} an unusual feature, in {{that instead of}} coming into force on one particular date, it instead came into force on different dates {{in different parts of}} the world. It came into force in May 1793 in respect of acts done in Great Britain, and also in May in respect of anything done outside of Great Britain by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in Great Britain at any time after 1 April. It came into force on 1 June in respect of anything done in Europe (other than Great Britain) by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> in Great Britain at any time between 1 April and 1 June. It came into force on 1 August as to any acts done outside Europe, but not beyond the Cape of Good Hope, by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> in Great Britain between 1 April and 1 August. It came into force on 1 November in respect of anything done beyond the Cape of Good Hope by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> in Great Britain between 1 April and 1 November 1793.|$|R

500|$|Adam Sweeney of Film School Rejects was {{positive}} about the episode, [...] "For <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> complaining that Lost had been too slow lately, here you go. Those who watched 'The Variable' saw more action than (basketball player) Wilt Chamberlain. They, and by they I mean we, also got a clear explanation of how the islanders got onto the island. You wanted answers, you got them." [...] Sweeney also believed Davies's acting was the [...] "high point" [...] of the episode. David Oliver of CHUD.com gave the episode an 8.6 rating out of 10, and commented {{that it was a}} [...] "good" [...] episode, though he was [...] "bummed" [...] to see Daniel go. Oliver also said that while the episode did [...] "very little" [...] to advance the season storyline significantly, there were [...] "some significant" [...] developments and revelations in it. TV Verdict's Stephen Lackey said the episode was [...] "fast paced" [...] and featured [...] "one exciting twist after another".|$|E

2500|$|After the decision, the NBA allowed {{players to}} leave college early as [...] "hardship cases", which {{essentially}} {{meant that the}} player had to prove financial hardship. This rule quickly developed into one that was observed in the breach, with Sport magazine writer Jackie Lapin commenting in the 1970s that [...] "Almost <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any good at {{the game in the}} past decade would qualify [...] — with the probable exception of Bill Bradley, the banker's son." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Larson {{accepted}} {{a position of}} assistant professor at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College in Erie, Pennsylvania. [...] At the time, Behrend College was a 2-year branch campus of the university. [...] In 1971, the Board of Trustees of the University met with the Behrend Advisory Board to announce Behrend College would become the first location outside University Park with the authority to develop baccalaureate program and confer degrees locally. During his first several years at the college, Larson was instrumental in developing a mathematics major at the college. [...] He served {{as a member of}} the University Faculty Senate and also as Behrend College's representative on the University Faculty Council. [...] Larson was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor in 1983. Early in his career at Penn State, Larson started writing manuscripts for textbooks. He completed and submitted three manuscripts for calculus texts in 1973, 1974, and 1975 ... only to be rejected by several publishers. [...] Larson relates his determination to continue writing in an essay titled A Single Dream. [...] "When Marilyn Monroe was asked if she had been lucky in her career, she said 'When you have a single dream it is more than likely to come true---because you keep working toward it without getting mixed up.' <b>Anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in my office knows that I am a Marilyn fan. But not just a Marilyn fan---I am a fan of the American Dream." [...] Finally, in 1976 he and his co-author, Robert P. Hostetler, obtained a contract from D. C. Heath and Company. The first edition of their calculus book was published in December, 1978. [...] In 1995, Hostetler left the authorship team and was replaced by Bruce A. Edwards of the University of Florida. [...] Calculus by Larson and Edwards is now in its tenth edition. [...] It is used worldwide and has been translated in several languages.|$|E

I couldn't, of course, see it, but I could hear, or sense in some way, the sound of it. I could feel my hair, all of it, rising upon my head. I was aware that there was a presence in the adjoining room, I will not say a person, a living soul, but a presence. <b>Anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{in the next room}} to a presence will know just how I felt. I could hear a sound as of some one groping on the floor and the faint rattle as of coins.|$|E

60|$|We refer {{our readers}} to a careful study of Dr. Forbes Winslow's {{consideration}} of this subject given in Part III. <b>Anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{familiar with the}} delicacy and acuteness of Dr. Winslow, as shown in his work on obscure diseases {{of the brain and}} nerves, must feel that his positive assertion on this ground is the best possible evidence. We here gratefully acknowledge our obligations to Dr. Winslow for the corrected proof of his valuable letter, which he has done us the honour to send for this work. We shall consider that his argument, in connection with what the reader may observe of Lady Byron's own writings, closes that issue of the case completely.|$|E
6000|$|This transfiguration of {{the world}} into a theocracy may seem a merely fantastic idea to anyone who comes to it freshly without such general {{theological}} preparation as the preceding pages have made. But to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> at the pains to clear his mind even a little from the obsession of existing but transitory things, it ceases to be a mere suggestion and {{becomes more and more}} manifestly the real future of mankind. From the phase of [...] "so things should be," [...] the mind will pass very rapidly to the realisation that [...] "so things will be." [...] Towards this the directive wills among men have been drifting more and more steadily and perceptibly and with fewer eddyings and retardations, for many centuries. The purpose of mankind will not be always thus confused and fragmentary. This dissemination of will-power is a phase. The age of the warring tribes and kingdoms and empires that began a hundred centuries or so ago, draws to its close. The kingdom of God on earth is not a metaphor, not a mere spiritual state, not a dream, not an uncertain project; it is the thing before us, it is the close and inevitable destiny of mankind.|$|E
