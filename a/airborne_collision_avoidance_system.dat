40|$|Purpose: The risk of {{critical}} proximities of several aircraft and appearance of multi-aircraft conflicts increases under current conditions of high dynamics and {{density of air}} traffic. The actual problem is a development of methods for optimal multi-aircraft conflicts resolution that should provide the synthesis of conflict-free trajectories in three-dimensional space. Methods : The method for optimal resolution of multi-aircraft conflicts using heading, speed and altitude change maneuvers has been developed. Optimality criteria are flight regularity, flight economy and the complexity of maneuvering. Method provides the sequential synthesis of the Pareto-optimal set of combinations of conflict-free flight trajectories using multi-objective dynamic programming and selection of optimal combination using the convolution of optimality criteria. Within described method the following are defined: the procedure for determination of combinations of aircraft conflict-free states that define the combinations of Pareto-optimal trajectories; the limitations on discretization of conflict resolution process for ensuring the absence of unobservable separation violations. Results : The analysis of the proposed method is performed using computer simulation which results show that synthesized combination of conflict-free trajectories ensures the multi-aircraft conflict avoidance and complies with defined optimality criteria. Discussion: Proposed method {{can be used for}} development of new automated air traffic control <b>systems,</b> <b>airborne</b> <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems,</b> intelligent air traffic control simulators and for research activities. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{requirement for}} the integration of unmanned aircraft into civil airspace is the capability of aircraft to remain well clear {{of each other and}} avoid collisions. This requirement has led to a broad recognition of the need for an unambiguous, formal definition of well clear. It is further recognized that any such definition must be interoperable with existing <b>airborne</b> <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> (ACAS). A particular class of well-clear definitions uses logic checks of independent distance thresholds as well as independent time thresholds in the vertical and horizontal dimensions to determine if a well-clear violation is predicted to occur within a given time interval. Existing ACAS systems also use independent distance thresholds, however a common time threshold is used for the vertical and horizontal logic checks. The main contribution of this paper is the characterization {{of the effects of the}} decoupled vertical time threshold on a well-clear definition in terms of (1) time to well-clear violation, and (2) interoperability with existing ACAS. The paper provides governing equations for both metrics and includes simulation results to illustrate the relationships. In this paper, interoperability implies that the time of well-clear violation is strictly less than the time a resolution advisory is issued by ACAS. The encounter geometries under consideration in this paper are initially well clear and consist of constant-velocity trajectories resulting in near-mid-air collisions...|$|R
50|$|A traffic {{collision}} avoidance system or traffic alert and {{collision avoidance}} system (both abbreviated as TCAS, and pronounced tee-kas) is an aircraft {{collision avoidance system}} designed to reduce the incidence of mid-air collisions between aircraft. It monitors the airspace around an aircraft for other aircraft equipped with a corresponding active transponder, independent of air traffic control, and warns pilots of the presence of other transponder-equipped aircraft which may present a threat of mid-air collision (MAC). It is a type of <b>airborne</b> <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization to be fitted to all aircraft with a maximum take-off mass (MTOM) of over 5700 kg or authorized to carry more than 19 passengers. CFR 14, Ch I, part 135 requires that TCAS I is installed for aircraft with 10-30 passengers and TCAS II for aircraft with more than 30 passengers.|$|E
5000|$|Another mode called Mode S (Select) is {{designed}} to help avoiding overinterrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are compatible with Mode A and Mode C Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) systems. [...] This is the type of transponder that is used for TCAS or ACAS II (<b>Airborne</b> <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System)</b> functions, and is required to implement the extended squitter broadcast, one means of participating in ADS-B systems. A TCAS-equipped aircraft must have a Mode S transponder, but not all Mode S transponders include TCAS. Likewise, a Mode S transponder is required to implement 1090ES extended squitter ADS-B Out, but {{there are other ways to}} implement ADS-B Out (in the U.S. and China.) The format of Mode S messages is documented in ICAO Doc 9688, Manual on Mode S Specific Services.|$|E

5000|$|TEM {{involves}} the effective detection {{and response to}} internal or external factors that {{have the potential to}} degrade the safety of an aircraft's operations. Methods of teaching TEM stress replicability, or reliability of performance across recurring situations. TEM aims to prepare crews with the [...] "coordinative and cognitive ability to handle both routine and unforeseen surprises and anomalies." [...] The desired outcome of TEM training is the development of 'resiliency'. Resiliency, in this context, is the ability to recognize and act adaptively to disruptions which may be encountered during flight operations. TEM training occurs in various forms, with varying levels of success. Some of these training methods include data collection using the line operations safety audit (LOSA), implementation of crew resource management (CRM), cockpit task management (CTM), and the integrated use of checklists in both commercial and general aviation. Some other resources built into most modern aircraft that help minimize risk and manage threat and error are <b>airborne</b> <b>collision</b> and <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> (ACAS) and ground proximity warning systems (GPWS). With the consolidation of onboard computer systems and the implementation of proper pilot training, airlines and crew members look to mitigate the inherent risks associated with human factors.|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for positioning, navigation and tracking problems using particle filters (sequential Monte Carlo methods) is developed. It {{consists of a}} class of motion models and a general non-linear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low-dimensional. This is of utmost importance for highperformance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter based algorithms. Here the use of non-linear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map, and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests {{have shown that the}} accuracy in both cases is comparable to satellite navigation (as GPS), but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to <b>airborne</b> hunting and <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> in cars...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{research}} has focused on the use of a computational method known as dynamic programming for producing an optimized decision logic for <b>airborne</b> <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance.</b> There have been a series of technical reports, conference papers, and journal articles summarizing the research, but they have primarily investigated two-aircraft encounters with only one aircraft equipped with a <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis looks at recent research on coordination, interoperability, and multiple-threat encounters. In situations where an aircraft encounters another aircraft with a <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system,</b> {{it is important that the}} resolution advisories provided to the pilots be coordinated so that both aircraft are not instructed to maneuver in the same direction. Interoperability is a related consideration since new <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> will be occupying the same airspace as legacy systems. Resolving encounters with multiple intruders poses computational challenges that will be addressed in this thesis. The methodology presented in this thesis results in logic that is safer and performs better than the legacy Traffic Alert and <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS). To assess the performance of the system, this thesis uses U. S. airspace encounter models. The results indicate that the proposed methodology can bring significant benefit to the current airspace and can support the need for safe, non-disruptive collision protection as the airspace continues to evolve. by Dylan M.
