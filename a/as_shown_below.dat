5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>below</b> where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|The {{corpus of}} {{published}} Epistles {{did not change}} after Bellman's death. Many minor selections from the Epistles have been published, sometimes with illustrations and introductions.

5|$|Since each prime p divides L by assumption, it {{must also}} divide one of the q factors; since each q is prime as well, it must be that p=q. Iteratively {{dividing}} by the p factors shows that each p has an equal counterpart q; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
