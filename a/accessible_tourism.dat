50|$|<b>Accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{the ongoing}} {{endeavour}} to ensure tourist destinations, {{products and services}} are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities or age. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations. The term has been defined by Darcy and Dickson (2009, p34) as:Accessible tourism enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments.

40|$|World Heritage listing aims {{to provide}} {{protection}} for the planet 2 ̆ 7 s most precious natural and cultural sites. Listing can also increase awareness and visitation, particularly as presentation is a tenet of the World Heritage Convention. Visitor management, based on empirical research, is therefore required to ensure an appropriate balance between these, often conflicting, obligations of protection and presentation. Many World Heritage visitor studies have considered iconic, <b>accessible,</b> international <b>tourism</b> destinations that are facing issues of visitor congestion and threatened heritage values. To provide a balanced understanding of World Heritage tourism, further research is required, particularly focusing on various site types and different World Heritage visitors. To support this agenda, this research identified a lesser-known World Heritage Area with low visitation levels, developed a self-administered visitor questionnaire appropriate for the site, and studied the visitor characteristics, motivations, and experiences. Findings regarding visitors to the remote Riversleigh World Heritage Site in Australia indicate that these visitors differ from visitors to iconic World Heritage Areas, although motivational aspects are similar. The outcomes of the research have informed the visitor interpretive plan developed by the state government responsible for delivering on the Convention requirements for the Riversleigh World Heritage Site, and provide a visitor questionnaire that can be used, or further developed, for other sites...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> and its links with triple-bottom-line (TBL) sustainability. <b>Accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{reviewed}} through some of its central features including dimensions of access, universal design and the nexus between ageing and disability. The TBL is then examined {{to better understand the}} financial, environmental and social considerations that arise from <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism.</b> The research design used in this explorative research incorporated a case study approach, where a business case study instrument was developed. Methods included a Delphi group, review of management information systems, in-depth interviews with key informants, observation and participant observation. The study results revealed that rather than <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> being a single construct, it forms one critical dimension of a series of interrelated, overlapping and interdependent business arrangements that extend beyond the business entity through a series of social networks within the destination region. It is argued that to properly satisfy the <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> market, a more sophisticated understanding of accessible destination experiences is needed by tourism operators. The case study illustrates the considerable size and multi-niche markets served by <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> destinations, the good fit between <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> and TBL sustainable tourism, and the need for further research...|$|E
40|$|Purpose <b>Accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{evolving}} {{as a field}} of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine key concepts and global initiatives that will shape <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures. Design/methodology/approach Three of the authors have extensive academic experience in the area and the fourth author is the Managing Director of the pre-eminent European Network for <b>Accessible</b> <b>Tourism.</b> In taking a limited Delphi approach to canvassing key areas likely to shape <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures, the following concepts and policy initiatives were examined: motivations, dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness; universal design (UD); and the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Findings A discussion of each of the above areas was placed in context to <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures and to contextualise the papers that were selected for the special issue. The latter part of the paper outlines the contribution of each empirical paper to the issue discussing the approach, findings and implications. Stakeholder collaboration was identified as the key common theme of the papers and the factor for developing <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. A collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. To assist in the development of <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures, UD principles should provide a foundation to enhance the future competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations. Originality/value The paper’s examination of the concepts and global policy considerations provides a strong academic and practitioner foundation for considering <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures. In doing so, <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures are shown to be affected by key concepts related to core tourism considerations and major policy initiatives on accessibility and sustainability. Yet, <b>accessible</b> <b>tourism</b> futures also have the potential to create their own momentum and contribute unique learnings on the diversity of tourism markets that will shape tourism concepts and global policy initiatives in their own right...|$|E

40|$|A NEW SPECIES OF SULCIA In 1962, Dresco {{described}} the first {{representative of the}} genus Sulcia from the Greek mainland, Sulcia lindbergi. Recently, Brignoli (1968 a) considered this species a subspecies of Sulcia cretica Fage. The genus is also known from Dalmatia, Hercegovina, Montenegro, and some adjacent islands (Kratochvil, 1938) and from the Island of Crete (Fage, 1945). In January 1969, my husband P. R. Deeleman, {{had the opportunity to}} visit the Koutouki Cave near the village of Ljopessi (officially also called Peania), situated at approximately 20 km west of Athens. This visit was made possible by the assistance of Mrs. A. Petrochilos and Mr. A. Kanellis, to whom we feel very much obliged. In this cave a new species of Sulcia was collected. The cave was discovered fairly recently; it has been exploited as a show cave with electric illumination since 1962. The spiders were found in the huge main chamber, where they were hanging in their webs in crevices in the wall or between stalagmites. The cave is also inhabitied by bats, terrestrial isopods, diplopods and Orthoptera (Dolichopoda petrochilosi Chopard). The original entrance is a vertical shaft of about 15 meters, it has been made <b>accessible</b> for <b>tourism</b> by an artificial entrance.
