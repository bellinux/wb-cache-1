5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} <b>about</b> <b>either</b> Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided {{that it was a good}} idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House's permission.|$|E
5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came <b>about,</b> <b>either</b> as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E

5|$|The main {{literary}} {{sources for}} the 4th-century army are the Res Gestae (History) of Ammianus Marcellinus, whose surviving books cover the period 353 to 378. Marcellinus, himself a veteran soldier, is regarded by scholars as a reliable and valuable source. But he largely fails {{to remedy the deficiencies}} of the Notitia as regards army and unit strength or units in existence, as he is rarely specific <b>about</b> <b>either.</b> The third major source for the late army is the corpus of imperial decrees published in the East Roman empire in the 5th and 6th centuries: the Theodosian code (438) and the Corpus Iuris Civilis (528–39). These compilations of Roman laws dating from the 4th century contain numerous imperial decrees relating to all aspects of the regulation and administration of the late army.|$|E

25|$|Though {{radicals}} are widely {{accepted as a}} method to categorize Chinese characters and to locate a certain character in a dictionary, there is no universal agreement <b>about</b> <b>either</b> {{the exact number of}} radicals, or the set of radicals. This is because {{radicals are}} merely arbitrarily chosen categories for lexicographical purposes.|$|E
25|$|The {{general format}} of the show starts with two segments, where Cramer {{recommends}} one or more stocks in a group with his rationale for choosing them. At {{the end of each}} segment, Cramer will take one or two calls from viewers with questions <b>about</b> <b>either</b> the stock he recommended, or another stock in the same industry or which the viewer thinks may benefit from the topic discussed.|$|E
25|$|Darius Baronas {{agreed with}} Rowell {{that the event}} did occur, but {{clarified}} that {{the author of the}} Bychowiec Chronicle did not know <b>about</b> <b>either</b> Chronica or De Conformitate Vitae as there are no textual similarities between the works. He concluded that the story in the Bychowiec Chronicle stems from a real historical event that embellished with various fictional elements that served political needs of the chronicle's sponsors.|$|E

25|$|A 1992 World Bank report {{published}} in the Journal of Development Economics said that Inequality is negatively, and robustly, correlated with growth. This result is not highly dependent upon assumptions <b>about</b> <b>either</b> {{the form of the}} growth regression or the measure of inequality...Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the relationship between inequality and growth is relatively small. NYU economist William Baumol found that substantial inequality does not stimulate growth because poverty reduces labor force productivity. Economists Dierk Herzer and Sebastian Vollmer found that increased income inequality reduces economic growth, but growth itself increases income inequality.|$|E
25|$|A forest butterfly, {{the brown}} awl favours {{openings}} and edges of deciduous and evergreen forests while its caterpillars {{are to be}} found in moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. It flies <b>about</b> <b>either</b> late or early in the morning in the shade of the jungles. It can be sometimes seen in bright sunlight visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic at such times, moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of direct}} routes {{to the city}} center was not popular among travelers, and a direct bus service from the area around Hellerud was introduced. These {{was taken over by}} Akersbanerne in 1928, who {{subcontracted}} the operations to De Blå Omnibusser. Later the concession was given to the bus company. New negotiations between the tram companies were carried out, but neither party was willing to make sufficient admittances for agreement to be reached. Akersbanerne merged its operation {{to the west of the}} city center with Holmenkolbanen in 1933, and the Østensjø Line was the only remaining service they operated. Akersbanerne started negotiating with both Ekebergbanen and Bærumsbanen <b>about</b> <b>either</b> of them taking over the route.|$|E

500|$|Saurolophus ( [...] ; meaning [...] "lizard crest") is a genus {{of large}} saurolophine hadrosaurid dinosaurs that lived about 70.0–68.5million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous of North America and Asia; {{it is one}} of the few genera of dinosaurs known from {{multiple}} continents. It is distinguished by a spike-like crest which projects up and back from the skull. Saurolophus was a herbivorous dinosaur which could move <b>about</b> <b>either</b> bipedally or quadrupedally.|$|E
500|$|The band {{have said}} the lyrics refer {{to the events of}} both Bloody Sunday in 1972 and Bloody Sunday in 1920, but are not {{specifically}} <b>about</b> <b>either</b> event. The song takes the standpoint of someone horrified by the cycle of violence in the province. Bono rewrote the Edge's initial lyrics, attempting to contrast the two events with Easter Sunday, but he has said that the band were too inexperienced at the time to fully realise that goal, noting that [...] "it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength." ...|$|E
500|$|Chekhov {{replied that}} the letter had struck him [...] "like a thunderbolt" [...] and confessed, [...] "I have written my stories the way reporters write up their notes about fires – mechanically, half-consciously, caring nothing <b>about</b> <b>either</b> the reader or myself."" [...] The {{admission}} may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with extreme care, continually revising. Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1888, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection At Dusk (V Sumerkakh) won Chekhov the coveted Pushkin Prize [...] "for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} there was anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think there was anything to get excited <b>about,</b> <b>either.</b> Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me a Kiss" [...] and [...] "Gypsy Queen" [...] are {{the final}} songs {{recorded}} {{during the first}} recording session. Morrison wrote [...] "Give me a Kiss" [...] <b>about</b> <b>either</b> Planet or his newly born baby girl Shana. It is a twelve bar blues {{in the style of}} boogie rock, a music genre prominent in the 1960s, leading reviewers to compare the song to the work of The Beatles and Elvis Presley. Reviewers believed the song [...] "Gypsy Queen" [...] was inspired by [...] "Gypsy Woman", first recorded by Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions. Johnny Rogan feels the song is [...] "a failed attempt to recapture the spirit of 'Caravan'", another Morrison composition inspired by [...] "Gypsy Woman", released on the album Moondance. Morrison sings the song in falsetto, while keyboardist Alan Hand plays celeste, imitating a music box at both the beginning and end.|$|E
500|$|Mustaine has {{elaborated}} on {{the subject}} matter of several of the album's other songs as well. He has noted that [...] "Forget to Remember" [...] was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being <b>about</b> <b>either</b> a person trying to forget about a relationship or someone who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has memory problems. He also compared the concept behind the song to the film The Notebook. [...] "The Blackest Crow" [...] has a Southern influence and features a slide guitar, while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent depression. Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song, and reached out to country musicians Willie Nelson and Miranda Lambert; however, neither appeared on the song. [...] "Don't Turn Your Back..." [...] was inspired by a friend of Mustaine, who described him as [...] "the kind of guy that will steal your dope and then help you look for it." ...|$|E
