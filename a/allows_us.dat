25|$|Specifically, if V is a highest weight module, {{then the}} formal {{infinite}} sum, R, has a well-defined, and invertible, action on V ⊗ V, and this value of R (as {{an element of}} End(V ⊗ V)) satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation, and therefore <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to determine {{a representation of the}} braid group, and to define quasi-invariants for knots, links and braids.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the {{principle}} of duality <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> {{to set up a}} dual correspondence between two geometric constructions. The most famous of these is the polarity or reciprocity of two figures in a conic curve (in 2 dimensions) or a quadric surface (in 3 dimensions). A commonplace example is found in the reciprocation of a symmetrical polyhedron in a concentric sphere to obtain the dual polyhedron.|$|E

One might say that the RnF forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas RF does keep track of the complexes.|$|E
