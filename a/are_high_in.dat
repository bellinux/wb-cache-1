40|$|Four locally {{available}} {{crop residues}} viz., jowar stover (JS), maize stover (MS), red gram straw (RGS) and black gram straw (BGS) were evaluated for carbohydrate and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein (CNCP) system. Lignin (% NDF) <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> legume straws {{as compared to}} cereal stovers while Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) (% DM) followed the reverse trend. The carbohydrate fractions A and B 1 <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> BGS while B 2 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> MS as compared to other crop residues. The unavailable cell wall fraction (C) <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> legume straws when compared to cereal stovers. Among protein fractions, B 1 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> legume straws when compared to cereal stovers while B 2 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> cereal stovers as compared to legume straws. Fraction B 3 largely, bypass protein <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> MS as compared to other crop residues. Acid detergent insoluble crude protein (ADICP) (% CP) or unavailable protein fraction C was lowest <b>in</b> MS and <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> BGS.

5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> HSP {{and there are}} identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E

40|$|The {{proximate}} {{composition and}} various specific components of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, in the catch season between March and August were investigated. Frozen krill were freeze-dried and milled. The proximate composition comprised water, proteins, fats, ash, fatty acids, and amino acids, while the specific components were vitamins, minerals, nucleotides, betaine, and astaxanthin. The moisture {{content of the}} krill ranged from 77 to 80 %, with the <b>highest</b> value <b>in</b> June, and the ash content was be-tween 12 and 13 %. The protein content was lowest in May, and the fat content was 18 – 19 %, with the <b>highest</b> value <b>in</b> March. The amino acid content varied according to the season: taurine and glycine <b>were</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> August; β-alanine <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> April and May; and arginine, ornithine, and lysine <b>were</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> March. The unsaturated fat content was ~ 50 % and omega- 3 fatty acids <b>were</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> June. Oil-soluble vitamins A and E <b>were</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> March, and the water-soluble vitamin content was {{less than that of}} oil-soluble vitamins. The mineral content <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> June, and the most abundant mineral was sodium at 235. 60 mg/ 100 g krill. The content of other minerals was lowest (2. 94 mg/ 100 g) in April, except for lead. The nucleotide content <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> July, while the betaine content <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> April and lowest in June. The astaxanthin content <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> May and ranged from 6 to 10 ppm in other months...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to Africa, termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians {{are aware that}} termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> protein {{and can be used}} to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers <b>are</b> <b>high.</b> <b>In</b> rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped {{of leaves and}} eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet their}} protein {{requirements}} and obtain nitrogen, these lemurs also hunt small arthropods. In captivity, P.furcifer strongly favored preying mantises and moths {{of the family}} Sphingidae while ignoring grasshoppers, larva of the moth genus Coeloptera, and small reptiles. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the hands, a stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as galagos. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed on <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> protein, so some fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
