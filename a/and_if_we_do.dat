500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{therefore}} no surprise when closure notices were posted in March 1961. The {{last day of}} regular services was Saturday 10 June 1961 when a pair of C class 0-6-0's replaced the usual H class tanks. The event was recorded by a BBC cameraman who filmed the 09:07 departure from Paddock Wood. The Tonbridge crew had chalked on the cabside of the engine [...] "Shed no tears for the single track, for perhaps we may come back. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> you can be sure, we'll see you all again once more." [...] Later in the day the trains were lengthened {{with the addition of}} former LSWR push-pull set No. 656 and a Maunsell corridor coach. The same locomotive worked the last 17:00 train from Hawkhurst, while every seat was taken by locals and railway enthusiasts. The daughter of bandleader Jack Payne was on-hand to toast the final departure.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Bluff Harry is right, Ben; however, it ain't no use having words atween friends. We {{have got}} to stick {{together}} here, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>does</b> that <b>we</b> can clear this camp out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{hold the}} village," [...] the latter replied. [...] "We might {{get through the}} pass, but I doubt whether <b>we</b> should <b>do</b> so; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> my men <b>and</b> yours would suffer terribly. Can I rely upon your fellows keeping quiet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like {{to point}} out that it would be very slow work beating back up this inlet, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so there isn't a stage across the island for several days. No doubt you {{remember}} you have to see that contractor on Thursday, and there's the directors' meeting." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shach {{taught that}} {{events like the}} Holocaust {{occurred}} because {{the sins of the}} Jewish people accumulated, and they needed to be punished in order to rectify them. He said that, [...] "God kept count of each and every sin, in a running count over hundreds of years, until the count amounted to six million Jews, and that is how the Holocaust occurred. So must a Jew believe, and if a Jew does not completely believe this, he is a heretic, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not accept this as a punishment, then it is as if we don't believe in The Holy One, Blessed be He..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson {{published}} his journals of {{his involvement in}} the campaign in 1842 in The Expedition into Affghanistan, including a background to the conflict, his own journey across northern India to join the Army and his return, the hardship endured by the Army and its followers through the harsh terrain of Afghanistan beset by Beloochee tribesmen [...] and also of the time he spent in Kabul. He writes {{of the history of the}} land, its buildings and people, having met and painted many of the protagonists in the campaign, including both Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk and Dost Mohammad Khan. He realised the impossibility of controlling a country like Afghanistan in his line “Like Sisyphus, we have rolled up the huge stone to the top of the mountain, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not keep it there, our labour will be lost”. The same year Atkinson published Sketches in Afghaunistan, a folio of 25 tinted lithographed plates showing the topography and landscapes of Afghanistan and the Punjab creating an important record of “what was then an unexplored country”. Atkinson had planned a second volume but the 'worked up' paintings were lost at sea en route to his British publisher where they were to be engraved; the original sketches he had prepared on the spot however are in the British Library.|$|E
2500|$|As {{additional}} tests are discussed for {{addition to the}} panels, issues arise. [...] Many question if the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the {{additional tests}}. [...] Many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment, {{while some of the}} diseases need not be treated until later in life. [...] This raises more issues, such as: if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all? <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> what do we tell the families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases? Studies show that the more rare the disease is and the more diseases being tested for, the more likely the tests are to produce false-positives. This is an issue because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child, and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a false-positive still worried that their child was fragile and/or sickly even though they were not, potentially preventing the parent-child bond forming as it would have otherwise. As a result, some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened. Many parents are also concerned about what happens with their infant's blood samples after screening. The samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases, but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for DNA identification and research, increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child.|$|E
60|$|Something {{there has}} been of dulness in our little reunions of society which did not use to cloud them. But I have seen all my own old and kind friends, with my dear {{children}} (Charles alone excepted); <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not rejoice with perfect joy, it was overshadowed from {{the same sense of}} regret.|$|R
6000|$|That same {{afternoon}} we were arrested, {{and here we}} are, ready to die <b>if</b> <b>we</b> must, but I swear that I have told you the truth, and I ask you, {{in the name of}} justice, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have <b>done</b> anything wrong, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not act like loyal and true citizens, even though we were pitted against an emissary of the devil? ...|$|R
60|$|People {{sat down}} on him, for he would lie in chairs. No one loved him much, for he was not amiable in temper, but bit <b>and</b> {{scratched}} <b>if</b> touched, worried the bows off our slippers in his play, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not attend to him at once, he complained in the most tremendous bass growl I ever heard.|$|R
2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "As for the rest," [...] {{he added}} with a smile, [...] "it may be that there is {{something}} in what you say; but you see, times are hard. There is little work to be done, and scarce any timber coming down; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not get a good job, occasionally, it would go very hard with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Helen. [...] "That difference is, after all, imaginary. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} over here quite as you <b>do</b> in England, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> {{are you not}} a Thurston of Crosbie? But please believe that I am sorry, and--you insisted on the explanation--forgive me if I have said too much. There is a long future before you--and men change their minds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's no tea,' said Ella; 'a {{week ago}} or more that great Irene Brown {{walked in and}} {{reckoned}} we could lend her 'ma some tea and sugar, 'cause we had plenty. And we have used up our own since; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> ask her to return the loan, hers is such nasty stuff that nobody could drink it. What shall <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> Minna?' {{and she began to}} cry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary, look here. This is an {{expensive}} year, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the thing this year, we must put off making the drive through the fields--your approach, madam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> learn, {{perhaps we}} can take the biplane to college with us and astonish some of the {{students}} and the faculty," [...] Dick had added.|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON. By everybody. By {{the most}} unutterable swine. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not leave this abominable city now: do you hear? now; I shall be called darling by the Empress.|$|E
6000|$|... "But for {{all that}} we can't keep him," [...] said Stella. [...] "Aunt Jimsie is coming next week and she will bring the Sarah-cat with her. We can't keep two cats; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> this Rusty Coat would fight {{all the time with}} the Sarah-cat. He's a fighter by nature. He had a pitched battle last evening with the tobacco-king's cat and routed him, horse, foot and artillery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! why not, why not?" [...] said Mr. Haswell. [...] "Sunday {{is a day}} of rest when we make it a rule not to talk business, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> perhaps <b>we</b> might all {{change our}} minds about these matters. Sir Robert is coming, and I am sure that your cousin Barbara will be very {{disappointed}} {{if you do not}} turn up, for she understands nothing about these city things which are Greek to her." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We were {{required}} to perform {{a certain number of}} sterilizations each month. This was obligatory <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not comply, <b>we</b> were fired. Many providers did not inform women {{that they were going to}} be sterilized - they told them that the procedure was something else. But I felt this was wrong. I preferred to offer women a bag of rice to convince them to accept the procedure and explained to them beforehand what was going to happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{let us do}} that!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "Who knows {{but that}} we'll run across Blower and Merwell? <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> we can easily prove that Link is a fraud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Matthew Round, {{when that}} visit was nearly {{brought to a}} close, [...] "that we are pressed very hard {{to go on with}} this, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not, {{somebody}} else will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't {{be helped}} sometimes. I've {{had enough of}} adventures, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> live to escape from this place all the gold in the world wouldn't tempt me to get into another such scrape." ...|$|E
6000|$|There were outcries about {{provisions}} and wine or ale, and shouts demanding more, and when Pierce {{declared that he}} would not have the lady insulted, there was a hoarse loud laugh. He was about to order Tordu as ringleader into custody, but Ridley said to him aside, [...] "Best not, sir; his fellows will not lay a finger on him, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so, there would be a brawl, and we might come by the worst." ...|$|R

5000|$|It's {{interesting}} {{that over the}} years, Constantine seems like it's become...like it has this sort of cult following, which has been great. It's been embraced. It {{would be great to}} figure out a sequel, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> we've been trying to figure one out, {{it would be great to}} do the really dark, scary version. We got caught in that weird PG-13R no man's land, and <b>we</b> should <b>do</b> the hard-R scary version, which I would love to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I'm in {{no hurry}} to leave, and that's a fact," [...] Mr. Van Decht admitted. [...] "I've an {{appointment}} with the manager of your cars here to-morrow, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> business I guess I'll have to stop." ...|$|E
60|$|Turn we {{once again}} to the great wilderness, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> so with half the zest felt by Big Otter when he set forth on his journey, we will {{certainly}} enjoy the trip, you and I, whoever you be.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} they are not {{counting}} their chickens before they are hatched," [...] Chris said. [...] "I doubt very greatly whether we shall carry those hills in front of us, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the ranges behind are no doubt fortified.

60|$|This {{is a very}} {{difficult}} and distressing business to the divers They have to remain under the water {{as long as they can}} possibly hold their breath, and very often they are seriously injured by their exertions in this way. But when we use the sponges we never think of this. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> what good would it do? All over the world men are to be found who are perfectly willing to injure their health, provided they are paid for it.|$|R
60|$|This was {{wholesome}} advice, {{and such}} as {{was not to}} be slighted; so we stood away to the west, keeping between the latitude of 31 and 35, and had very good weather and fair winds for about ten days' sail; by which time, by our reckoning, we were clear of the isles, and might run away to the north; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not fall in with Ceylon, we should at least go into the great deep Bay of Bengal.|$|R
60|$|For my part I {{had seen}} {{enough of the}} British-lover; we had {{captured}} him twice, which was our full share of such business, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> spend time hunting him down, providing he yet remained in the city, what could <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with the villain? He had forfeited all rights of citizenship in our section of the country, and I {{had no doubt that}} wherever he went his sins would find him out. It was better we leave him alone, from whatever standpoint I viewed it.|$|R
