40|$|The pain {{relieving}} {{properties of}} imipramine (100 mg orally), tramadol (150 mg orally), and <b>anpirtoline</b> (60 mg orally) were compared in 16 healthy subjects in a cross-over, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. <b>Anpirtoline</b> exhibits analgesia which is possibly mediated via serotoninergic pathways, whereas tramadol exerts its effects at opioid receptors. The pain-relieving {{effect of the}} tricyclic antidepressant imipramine may involve both serotoninergic and opioid mechanisms. Chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) were recorded after painful stimulation of the nasal mucosa with carbon dioxide. Subjects rated the perceived intensity of the stimuli {{by means of a}} visual analogue scale. In addition, acoustically evoked responses were recorded, the spontaneous EEG was analyzed in the frequency domain, the subjects' vigilance was assessed in a tracking task, and side effects of the drugs were monitored. <b>Anpirtoline</b> and tramadol produced a decrease of both CSSERP amplitudes and subjective estimates of pain, the effects of the former compound being greater. In contrast, after administration of imipramine no change of CSSERP amplitudes could be detected, whereas the subjective estimate of pain intensity decreased significantly. This was accompanied by a significant decrease of arousal indicating that pain relief produced by acute administration of imipramine was primarily related to its sedation action. The analgesic properties of <b>anpirtoline</b> were demonstrated in man. Tramadol was characterized as a week opioid analgesic. In contrast, imipramine appeared to produce its pain-relieving effects predominantly by non-specific actions. It is hypothesized that different analgesics may change ERP sources in a drug-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{serotonin}} {{system has}} emerged as a potential target for anti-dyskinetic therapy in Parkinson's disease. In fact, serotonin neurons can convert L-DOPA into dopamine, and mediate its synaptic release. However, they lack a feedback control mechanism able to regulate synaptic dopamine levels, which leads to un-physiological stimulation of post-synaptic striatal dopamine receptors. Accordingly, drugs able to dampen the activity of serotonin neurons can suppress L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Here, we investigated the ability of the 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonist <b>anpirtoline</b> to counteract L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in L-DOPA-primed 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats and MPTP-treated macaques. Results suggest that <b>anpirtoline</b> dose-dependently reduced dyskinesia both in rats and monkeys; however, the effect in MPTP-treated macaques was accompanied by a worsening of the Parkinson's disease score at significantly effective doses (1. 5 and 2. 0 mg/kg). At a lower dose (0. 75 mg/kg), <b>anpirtoline</b> markedly reduced dyskinesia in 4 out of 5 subjects, but statistical significance was prevented by the presence of a non-responsive subject. These results provide further evidence that the serotonin neurons contribute both to the pro-dyskinetic effect of L-DOPA and to its therapeutic efficacy in the rat and monkey models of Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK 3) is a constitutively active {{protein kinase}} in brain. Increasing {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} GSK 3 acts as a modulator in the serotonin neurotransmission system, including direct interaction with serotonin 1 B (5 -HT 1 B) receptors in a highly selective manner and prominent modulating effect on 5 -HT 1 B receptor activity. In this study, we utilized the serotonin neuron-selective GSK 3 b knockout (snGSK 3 b-KO) mice to test if GSK 3 b in serotonin neurons selectively modulates 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptor activity and function. The snGSK 3 b-KO mice were generated by crossbreeding GSK 3 b-floxed mice and ePet 1 -Cre mice. These mice had normal growth and physiological characteristics, similar numbers of tryptophan hydroxylase- 2 (TpH 2) -expressing serotonin neurons, and the same brain serotonin content as in littermate wild type mice. However, the expression of GSK 3 b in snGSK 3 b-KO mice was diminished in TpH 2 -expressing serotonin neurons. Compared to littermate wild type mice, snGSK 3 b-KO mice had a reduced response to the 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonist <b>anpirtoline</b> in the regulation of serotonergic neuron firing, cAMP production, and serotonin release, whereas these animals displayed a normal response to the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT. The effect of <b>anpirtoline</b> on the horizontal, center, and vertical activities in the open field test was differentially affected by GSK 3 b depletion in serotonin neurons, wherein vertical activity, but not horizontal activity, was significantly altered in snGSK 3 b-KO mice. In addition, there was an enhanced anti-immobility response to <b>anpirtoline</b> in the tail suspension test in snGSK 3 b-KO mice. Therefore, results of this stud...|$|E
40|$|Ejaculatory {{problems}} and anorgasmia are well-known side-effects of the SSRI antidepressants, and a pharmacologically induced increase in serotonergic neurotransmission inhibits ejaculatory behaviour in the rat. In {{the present study}} the role of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors in the mediation of male rat ejaculatory behaviour was examined by use of selective agonists and antagonists acting at these 5 -HT receptor subtypes. The 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 25 – 4. 00 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.) produced an expected facilitation of the male rat ejaculatory behaviour, and this effect was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the new selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist (R) - 3 -N,N-dicyclobutylamino- 8 -fluoro- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 5 -carboxamide hydrogen (2 R, 3 R) tartrate monohydrate (NAD- 299) (1. 0 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.). NAD- 299 by itself (0. 75 – 3. 00 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.) {{did not affect the}} male rat ejaculatory behaviour. The 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonist <b>anpirtoline</b> (0. 25 – 4. 00 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the male rat ejaculatory behaviour, and this effect was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist isamoltane (16 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.) {{as well as by the}} new and selective antagonist (R) -(+) - 2 -(3 -morpholinomethyl- 2 H-chromene- 8 -yl) oxymethylmorpholino methansulphonate (NAS- 181) (16 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.). Isamoltane (1. 0 – 16. 0 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.) and NAD- 181 (1. 0 – 16. 0 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.) had no, or weakly facilitatory effects on the male rat ejaculatory behaviour. The non-selective 5 -HT 1 receptor antagonist (−) -pindolol (8 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 s. c.), did not antagonize the inhibition produced by <b>anpirtoline.</b> The present results demonstrate opposite effects, facilitation and inhibition, of male rat ejaculatory behaviour by stimulation of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors, respectively, suggesting that the SSRI-induced inhibition of male ejaculatory dysfunction is due to 5 -HT 1 B receptor stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous, pacemaker-like {{activity}} of serotonergic raphe neurones and its autoregulation by somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A receptors are well described, but {{little is known}} of synaptic inputs onto raphe neurones or their modulation. Therefore, we recorded unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in caudal raphe neurones (raphe obscurus and pallidus) following local electrical stimulation in a neonatal rat brainstem slice preparation; most neurones (79 %; n = 72 / 91) recovered following post hoc immunohistochemistry were tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive, indicating that they were serotonergic. Evoked EPSCs occurred at relatively constant latency with variable amplitude and apparent ‘failures’ at fixed suprathreshold stimulus intensity. At − 60 mV, EPSCs were wholly due to CNQX-sensitive, non-NMDA glutamate receptors; at depolarized potentials, a small AP- 5 -sensitive NMDA component was often observed. EPSCs were potently and reversibly inhibited by 5 -HT with an EC 50 of 0. 1 μM. This effect was mimicked by 5 -HT 1 B agonists (CP- 93, 129 and <b>anpirtoline),</b> but not by a 5 -HT 1 A agonist (8 -OH-DPAT), indicating that 5 -HT 1 B receptors mediate the inhibition of EPSCs. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that inhibition of EPSCs by 5 -HT was mediated presynaptically. First, currents evoked by exogenous glutamate application were unaffected by 5 -HT and/or 5 -HT 1 B agonists. In addition, the frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic miniature EPSCs was diminished by CP- 93, 129 and paired-pulse facilitation of EPSCs was enhanced by 5 -HT. Finally, the 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists that blocked synaptic transmission {{had no effect on}} resting membrane properties of raphe neurones. These data indicate that serotonergic caudal raphe neurones receive glutamatergic inputs that are inhibited by presynaptic 5 -HT 1 B receptors; inhibition of excitatory synapses onto raphe cells may represent a novel mechanism for autoregulation of serotonergic neuronal activity by 5 -HT...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from April 30, 2014 - Oct. 30, 2014 The serotonergic system plays a significant regulatory role in osteoblast differentiation and proliferation. Serotonin (five-hydroxytryptamine or 5 HT) may promote or inhibit osteoblast proliferation depending upon the serotonin receptor isoforms expressed by the cell. Classically, 5 HT receptor 1 B (5 HTR 1 B) reduces osteoblast proliferation by inhibiting phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor. Conversely, 5 HT receptor 2 A (5 HTR 2 A) activation positively influences osteoblast proliferation through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Despite the serotonergic system being well characterized in normal osteoblasts, minimal information concerning the influence of serotonin on malignant osteoblasts is reported. The objectives of our study were to elucidate the expression, function, and potential of therapeutic targeting of these two receptors in a canine osteosarcoma cell line (COS) and primary normal canine osteoblasts (CnOb). Equal levels of htr 1 b (gene) and 5 HTR 1 B (protein) expression were found in normal and malignant osteoblasts. Treatment with serotonin enhanced viability of osteosarcoma cells but not normal osteoblasts. Challenge with the 5 HTR 1 B agonist <b>anpirtoline</b> did not change cell viability. Rather, incubation with the specific receptor antagonist SB 224289 caused reduction in osteoblast viability and osteosarcoma cells were more sensitive to this inhibitory effect. Investigation of this inhibitory activity showed 5 HTR 1 B antagonism induces capase- 3 / 7 activation in malignant cells. Evaluation of phosphorylated levels of CREB and ERK revealed abnormal 5 HTR 1 B signaling in COS. Htr 2 a (gene) and 5 HTR 2 A (protein) expression was observed in COS and CnOb, with osteosarcoma cells demonstrating five-fold greater receptor expression than normal osteoblasts. Antagonism of 5 HTR 2 A with the inhibitor ritanserin attenuated viability in neoplastic and normal cells. COS appeared {{more sensitive to the}} inhibitory activity of ritanserin than did CnOb. 5 HTR 2 A blockade induced increased activity of caspase- 3 / 7 in COS, thus promoting apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. Discordant patterns of CREB and ERK phosphorylation were found between malignant and normal osteoblasts following 5 HTR 2 A pharmacologic manipulation, suggesting aberrant receptor signaling in neoplastic cells. Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate that functional aspects of the serotonergic signaling system are present in a canine osteosarcoma cell line. 5 HTR 1 B and 5 HTR 2 A could plausibly have roles in the genesis and progression of osteosarcoma. Importantly, both serotonin receptors appear to be novel therapeutic targets. Future investigations into the relationship between canine osteosarcoma and other serotonergic signaling components may highlight previously unknown aspects of osteosarcoma biology...|$|E
