5|$|Moult is {{prolonged}} in all tubenoses, since they must maintain {{an ability to}} fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage <b>after</b> <b>those</b> further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.|$|E

They cost 60,000,000 yen each and had a crew of 54 officers and 822 enlisted men.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled <b>after</b> <b>those</b> of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.|$|E

It has also been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and from Earth for the past 23 years. Ground-based observations of the rings require the largest available telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written <b>after</b> <b>those</b> included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E

5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, Suebi populations {{established}} themselves in the countryside. It was first mentioned on March 26, 953 during the rule of Mumadona Dias, Countess of Portugal. The region was attacked by the Vikings in the 960s, by the Moors in 997 and again by Norman pirates in 1015–1016. Hints indicate a Norse settlement in Villa Euracini <b>after</b> <b>those</b> invasions. During the Middle Ages, the name Euracini evolved to Uracini, Vracini, Veracini, Verazini, Verazim, Varazim and, eventually, Varzim.|$|E
5|$|Żółkiewski gained {{his first}} {{military}} experience under King Stefan Batory during the Danzig rebellion {{in which he}} commanded a rota of Polish hussars. He subsequently participated in Batory's Livonian campaign, fighting at Polotsk, Rossony (Sokół), Velizh and at the Siege of Pskov. Żółkiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family <b>after</b> <b>those</b> campaigns ended, particularly in their conflict with the Zborowscy. On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured Samuel Zborowski, whose subsequent execution caused much controversy. Żółkiewski became notorious {{for his role in}} the incident, and was the subject of heated debates during the Sejm of 1585.|$|E
5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled <b>after</b> <b>those</b> of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>those</b> {{operations}} in Phước Long district and Phước Bình sub-sector, the Viet Cong 9th Division {{was ordered to}} attack Đồng Xoài. In 1965, Đồng Xoài was a district town situated at a road junction which connected Inter-Inter-Provisional Road 13, National Highway 1 and Highway 14. The district was defended by 200 local Vietnamese soldiers drawn from the 327th and 328th Militia Companies, and the 111th Regional Force Company. They were supported by one armoured squadron (6 armoured vehicles) and two 105mm howitzers. There were also 200 Cambodian soldiers of a Civilian Irregular Defense Group, 11 United States Army Special Forces personnel, and nine U.S. Navy Seabees. Prior to the battle, the U.S Special Forces had assumed control of Đồng Xoài's defences; they stepped up guard and patrol activities, and ordered {{the construction of new}} defensive fortifications around the district headquarters, the Special Forces Camp, and the armoured and artillery positions on {{the eastern side of the}} district.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. <b>After</b> <b>those</b> parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby, {{commander}} of the Channel Squadron, transferred his flag to Agincourt as her sister Minotaur, his former flagship, was taken in hand for a refit that lasted until 1875. That year Agincourt was paid off in turn for a refit and re-armament that lasted until 1877. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the government became concerned that the Russians might advance on the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered Hornby to form a Particular Service Squadron to show the flag at Constantinople and deter any Russian threat. Agincourt served as the flagship for his second-in-command and the squadron sailed up the Dardanelles in a blinding snowstorm in February 1878. <b>After</b> <b>those</b> tensions faded, the ship returned to the Channel, where she served as second flag until 1889 including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. Over her active career, she served as flagship to no less than 15 admirals. That year she was again paid off and was subsequently held in reserve at Portsmouth until 1893, when she was transferred to Portland {{for use as a}} training ship.|$|E
