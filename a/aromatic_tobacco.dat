5000|$|Dottle can be {{produced}} by different factors. The primary cause of an excessive amount of dottle is a tightly packed or otherwise improperly packed pipe, where the tobacco has been improperly prepared or is compressed and will not burn properly. A second possible cause can be the excessive moisture content of the tobacco and the tobacco being smoked too quickly. This can result in tobacco that is too wet to burn. Rapid or hard draws on the pipe can and will produce an excessively hot ember in the bowl causing the moisture content of the tobacco to vaporize and then condense in bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole, preventing the tobacco from burning properly. A third contributor {{to the creation of}} dottle is propylene glycol or [...] "PG". This innocuous preservative used primarily in <b>aromatic</b> <b>tobaccos</b> can keep the moisture content high in pipe tobaccos even after drying. Smoking the pipe too fast can also produce a foul tasting liquid that collects {{at the bottom of the}} bowl and in the draft hole resulting in [...] "pipe gurgle"; this can be inadvertently tasted. Pushing a pipe cleaner down the stem can remedy this problem to a point. Another possible cause of pipe gurgle can be a [...] "wet smoker"; that is, a pipe smoker that pushes some saliva down the stem and into the bowl. Excessive saliva can be a factor but is rarely the cause of a [...] "wet smoke" [...] or pipe gurgle.|$|R
50|$|Decades of {{research}} has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung, larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.

Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990. However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the tobacco epidemic.|$|R

40|$|Roughly {{one-half}} of bladder cancer incidence in the United States {{can be attributed}} to known causes, mainly cigarette smoking, and it has been hypothesized that the <b>aromatic</b> amines in <b>tobacco</b> smoke are important etiological agents. Nonsmokers are also exposed, through unknown sources, to many of the same carcinogenic aromatic amines that are present in cigarette smoke. Previous epidemiological studies have not tested whether either of these aromatic amine exposures are associated with cancer risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Los Angeles County, California, involving 761 case patients with bladder cancer and 770 individually matched control subjects. In-person interviews provided information on tobacco smoking and other potential risk factors. Quantitative analysis of hemoglobin adducts of 4 - and 3 -aminobiphenyl (ABP) was used to assess aromatic amine exposure. Adducts of both aminobiphenyls were significantly higher in cases than in controls, independent of cigarette smoking at the time of blood collection and lifetime smoking history. Adjustment for other risk factors as well as for metabolic differences did not materially alter the associations. Our findings strengthen the connection between exposure to <b>aromatic</b> amines in <b>tobacco</b> smoke and cigarette smoking-related bladder cancer and suggest that environmental exposure to arylamines may account for a significant proportion of nonsmoking-related bladder cancer in the general population...|$|R

40|$|The cancer {{protective}} effect of cruciferous vegetables has {{been attributed to}} induction of phase II enzymes. But cruciferous vegetables also induce cytochrome P 4501 A 2 (CYP 1 A 2), which catalyzes the metabolic activation of various procarcinogens, including <b>aromatic</b> amines in <b>tobacco.</b> Thus, frequent intake of cruciferous vegetables could also result in cancer-enhancing effects. GSTMJ is involved in the detoxification of various carcinogens, but it also enhances the excretion of isothiocyanates and possibly other enzyme inducers in cruciferous vegetables.

Methods We try in this study, which is a cross sectional survey among {{a representative sample of}} waterpipe smokers in cafes/restaurants in Aleppo-Syria, to assess the time period for the beginning of this new smoking hype. We recruited 268 waterpipe smokers (161 men, 107 women; mean age ± standard deviation (SD) 30. 1 ± 10. 2, response rate 95. 3 %). Participants were divided into 4 birth cohorts (≤ 1960, 1961 – 1970, 1971 – 1980, > 1980) and year of initiation of waterpipe smoking and daily cigarette smoking were plotted according to these birth cohorts.

40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and {{efficient}} approach, directly suspended droplet microextraction (DSDME), {{has been applied to}} extract aroma components in Chinese southwest tobacco prior to analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The extraction para-meters such as organic solvent type, extraction time, temperature, stirring speed and volume were systemically optimized. A single drop of cyclohexane was placed {{on the top of the}} aqueous sample which was used as solvent. Under the optimal conditions of DSDME, 62 aroma components of tobacco were analyzed and identified by GC– MS. The approach was used to determine some important aromas in tobacco with the relative recoveries ranged from 75. 92 to 102. 88 %, relative standard deviations in the range of 3. 40 – 7. 14 % (n 5 5) and the limits of detection of 0. 0002 – 0. 002 mg/mL.

The cytotoxicity of e-liquids varies, and contamination with various chemicals have been detected in the liquid. Some liquids were very toxic and others {{had little or no}} cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity is mostly due to the amount and number of flavors added. Since nicotine has a bitter taste, nicotine e-liquids contain chemicals to cover up the nicotine taste.

The safety of inhaling flavors is mostly unknown, and their safety has not been determined by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association. In some cases e-liquids contain very large amounts of flavorings, which may cause irritation and inflammation on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Some flavors are regarded as toxic and a number of them resemble known carcinogens. Some artificial flavors are known to be cytotoxic. Unflavored vapor is less cytotoxic than flavored vapor.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} that Oriental tobacco is of {{national}} importance {{since it is the}} main export agricultural product and may utilize low fertility soils, which are unproductive for other crops, this study was conducted in order to investigate the maturation and senescence of tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum L.) under field conditions and to evaluate the effects of plant growth regulators (ethephon, JA, AOA, AVG and BA) on maturation process and on yield, quality and chemical characteristics of Oriental <b>tobacco,</b> <b>aromatic</b> type, variety BZ 7. The experimentation was carried out in the farm of the Tobacco Institute of Greece (T. I. G.) in 2001 and in Vamvakofyto in Serres, North Greece in 2002 and 2003. The maturation and senescence processes of tobacco leaves were studied in 2002 and 2003. In addition, the effect of ripening degree of leaves at harvest on agronomic, physical and chemical characteristics of cured leaf product was investigated, {{in order to determine the}} optimum harvesting period and the harvest date windows for tobacco leaves. The “harvest window” is that period in days when tobacco leaves should be harvested in order to assure good cured leaf quality and chemical composition after curing. Twelve sequential samplings of leaves at the accurately same age and position on the stalk (stalk position) were carried out every second day throughout the whole period of leaf development, maturing and senescence. All samplings were replicated 4 times. Leaves exhibited a climacteric-like surge in ethylene production before visible symptoms of senescence appear which was accompanied by a similar pattern of respiration rate and can be considered as a crucial and critical stage of senescence. The leaf maturity stage was followed by the stage of senescence that can be divided into two phases: The Stage I, the initial stage or the onset of senescence and the Stage II, in which the climacteric maximum of ethylene production and respiratory rate and the acceleration of senescence processes are occurred. The subsequent rise of ethylene production appears to be associated with the rapid phase of senescence and may indicate the final stage of the senescence processes. The Stage I lasts 4 days and is characterized by an increase of ethylene evolution, reducing sugars, nicotine, ash content and decrease in chlorophyll, total protein, starch and nitrate concentration. The results suggested that changes in nitrate concentration may provide a simple test for the initiation of harvest. The sap nitrate test can be used as an indicator of maturity. Nitrate determined by a commercial available field test. Sap nitrate concentration in the fully expanded bottom leaves should be less than 0, 9 - 1 % at the commencement of harvesting for optimal yield and quality. The effects of plant growth regulators (ethephon, JA, AVG and BA) on the control of maturation and senescence of tobacco leaves were studied in 2002. Six sequential samplings and measurements of leaves at the accurately same age and position on the stalk (stalk position) were carried out every second day throughout the whole period after the application of the above plant growth regulators (leaf development, mature and senescence). All samplings were replicated 4 times. The foliar application of ethephon and JA promoted and the AVG and BA delayed the physiological and biochemical processes of senescence. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Lorenzo Tomatis was {{an internationally}} {{recognized}} pioneer and leader in cancer prevention. The following remarks {{are made in}} honor of Lorenzo and his lifelong work. Molecular Epidemiology was conceived as a preventive approach, providing a valuable tool for investigating risk factors for cancer in vulnerable populations. Biomarkers {{can be used as}} early indicators of risk for preventative purposes and risk assessment. Humans are especially vulnerable during fetal development. Environmental exposures in utero can increase risks for both childhood and adult cancers; their interactions with genetic and nutritional susceptibility factors may further increase risk. Thus, the early developmental period represents an important window for cancer prevention. Background on fetal susceptibility: The fetus is generally at greater risk than the adult from toxic and carcinogenic environmental chemicals and other agents. A number of factors are involved: the high rates of absorption and retention of chemicals by the fetus, inability of the fetal liver to metabolize and detoxify toxins efficiently, the immaturity of fetal mechanisms of DNA repair and immune response, and the high rate of cell proliferation. In addition to directly damaging fetal cells and molecular/genetic targets, environmental chemicals can interfere with fetal development by disrupting the growth of the placenta and affecting the transplacental transfer of nutrients to the fetus. Thus, there is an increased likelihood that exposure to an environmental toxicant during the fetal period will result in procarcinogenic damage in the form of DNA adducts and mutation as well as epigenetic changes 1. Such procarcinogenic damage acquired during the fetal period will likely persist through many more cell divisions than those acquired later in life. There is therefore, a greater opportunity for cancer and other chronic diseases to develop when the causative exposure is experienced in utero. The importance of the fetal period is underscored by the growing number of environmental exposures that are known or suspected of increasing risk of childhood and adult cancer when the exposure occurs during the fetal period. These include air pollutants, such as polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons (PAHs), <b>tobacco</b> smoke, pesticides, solvents, and radiation 234567. Fetal exposures to endocrine disruptors have also been linked to diverse health effects in animal studies (and to a limited extent in humans), including cancers, immune disorders, and obesity 8. Thus, the fetal period represents an important opportunity for the prevention of cancer and other diseases. Results from recent molecular epidemiologic studies: Our studies at the Center for Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) relating various biologic markers to air pollutant exposures have highlighted the susceptibility of the fetus. In the New York City -based “Mothers and Newborns Cohort Study”, pregnant mothers wore personal air monitors to measure their exposure to PAHs during pregnancy 9. PAHs are widespread carcinogens, resulting from combustion of fossil fuels and other organic material. PAH-DNA adducts have been associated with cancer, both experimentally and in humans. The level of prenatal maternal urinary PAH metabolites has been measured as well as PAH-DNA adducts in cord and maternal blood. Although the estimated dose of PAH to the fetus is about 10 times lower than to the mother, maternal and cord white blood cells had equivalent levels of PAH-DNA adducts 10. This finding supports the increased susceptibility of the fetus to procarcinogenic DNA damage by these common environmental carcinogens 11. In the same cohort study, lymphocytes were examined in cord blood using whole-chromosome painting and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). High prenatal PAH exposure was associated with a higher frequency of stable chromosomal aberrations in cord blood 1213. These results showed a link between transplacental exposure to PAHs and genetic damage which may potentially increase risk of cancer. We are currently investigating the relationship between exposure, chromosomal aberrations and the TEL-AML 1 preleukemic alteration. My colleagues and I are evaluating the effects of prenatal exposures to PAHs and other environmental toxicants on epigenetic programming, specifically altered DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a covalent modification at cytosine residues of DNA, often occurring in promoter regions and inhibiting transcription 14. DNA methylation is believed {{to play a role in}} tumor formation. One example is the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes leading to a loss of expression 15 and the global hypomethylation seen in lung cancer 16. PAHs have been shown to alter DNA methylation patterns in various types of tumor cells. The fetus is particularly susceptible to exposures that can alter epigenetic markers because these patterns, which are generally heritable through successive cell divisions, are largely cleared and then re-established during early fetal development 17. In our NYC cohort study, we have found that global DNA methylation levels in cord blood white blood cells decreased with increasing prenatal PAH exposure [Herbstman et al. 2010 in prep. ]. Interestingly, we also found that global DNA methylation levels in cord blood were positively correlated with levels of PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood; thus adducts do not appear to mediate or modify the inverse association between PAH exposure and DNA methylation levels. These results indicate that the fetal epigenome is vulnerable to PAH exposure and that epigenetic dysregulation in the developing fetus due to PAH exposure does not directly involve PAH-DNA adduct formation. The results are consistent with experimental evidence that PAH-DNA adducts form preferentially at methylated DNA sites and that DNA methylation may make DNA more reactive and, therefore, more vulnerable to genetic damage by PAHs and other chemicals 18. Regarding persistence of epigenetic changes due to prenatal exposure, comparison of methylation levels in cord blood and blood collected at age 3 from the same children showed that methylation levels did not vary significantly over time. This suggests that PAH-related epigenetic perturbations are relatively stable over this period and could contribute to a wide range of health effects throughout childhood and possibly later in life. One of the disadvantages of the studies described above is that we measured overall DNA methylation levels, not the methylation status of specific genes. We are now examining the effects of prenatal PAH exposure on DNA methylation of specific genes. In a pilot study, our colleagues at the University of Cincinnati and we identified genes with differential methylation levels in cord white blood cells between children with low prenatal PAH exposure and high prenatal PAH exposure 19. We are currently using high throughput genome wide arrays in our birth cohorts in NYC and Poland to identify additional genes whose methylation patterns are vulnerable to disease-inducing perturbation by PAHs. Conclusion: Our studies provide molecular and genetic evidence of widespread exposure to PAHs, increased fetal susceptibility, and links between in utero exposure and biomarkers of potentially increased cancer risk, such as adducts and chromosomal aberrations. We have also found that prenatal PAH exposure affects epigenetic patterning by altering DNA methylation. Epigenetic alterations have been shown to play a role in cancer, and have also been found to be associated with a wide range of other diseases. Thus, increased fetal susceptibility to environmental contaminants can contribute to molecular alterations, quantifiable as biomarkers, which potentially increased risk of cancer and multiple diseases that may present across the life course. Measuring biomarkers associated with fetal exposure can therefore inform risk assessment and early intervention programs aimed at preventing cancer and other environmentally-related diseases.
