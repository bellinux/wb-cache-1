Contradictory forces affect the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>management,</b> such as the imperatives driving {{the introduction of new}} control systems which exist alongside the requirement to cut resources. In this book, contributors present both the problems and opportunities associated with the growth of management in the social care sector. They cover key topics including the implementation of change in the childcare sector; diversity - looking at the ways in which care managers can more effectively serve a growing multicultural and global society; performance measurement; the impact of electronic technologies and telecommunications; risk and safety in the workplace; and ethics in making personnel decisions, managing finances, planning and maintaining key relationships...|$|E

40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1991 In {{one school}} the {{principal}} and staff work vigorously and purposeful {{with the result that}} they experience a great deal of satisfaction. On the other hand dissatisfaction among the teachers at another school is almost tangible. These feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction rub off onto the pupils of such schools, and have a positive or negative influence on the pupils' results. The amount of satisfaction experienced by a school community, as well as the productivity maintained, reflects the "spirit" or climate that exists in the school. The creation of a positive climate in a school greatly depends on the spirit of openness and accessibility existing among both pupils and teachers. This entails that the members of a school community care for each other and that they accept co-responsibility for problems. With regard {{to the creation of a}} positive climate in schools it is important that the needs of both staff and pupils are recognised and that they experience security. This can be brought about by effective management, which means in fact, that creating school climate is primarily the task and responsibility of {{the principal and}} his managing team, of which the departmental head educational guidance is a member. Creating a climate in a school is done within the framework of the outlook on • life of the person who has to perform the managerial task of creating a climate and also by means of the managerial areas he is responsible for. Chapter three of this study deals not only with what school climate encompasses, but more specifically the creation of a positive school climate based on Christian Calvinistic perspectives. (Chapter two) Chapter four contains indications of how the departmental head educational guidance can perform the act of creating school climate as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> by realising the determinants of school climate and the areas of management he is responsible for. The creation of a school climate is often done in a hapazard manner. For this reason chapter five contains a method to guide the educational leader (i. e. the departmental head educational guidance) in planning the creation of school climate in a purposeful manner. The study is concluded in chapter six with a synopsis, findings, conclusions and recommendations. Master...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{summarizes}} {{the issue of}} the IRS, describes the system of training related to the emergency management within the IRS and a quantitative research carried out on two groups of respondents supports it. The research revealed that if police officers have lack of knowledge regarding cases when the life or the health of people could be threatened it can prolong the time when the first aid is provided and risks which influence the emergency event are not prevented in time and hereby loss of life, damage to health, property or environment can be caused. The aim of this thesis was to assess whether legal regulations of the Czech Republic and internal <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the Police of the CR applying to the issue <b>of</b> emergency <b>management,</b> solve the training of police officers in the field <b>of</b> emergency <b>management</b> in sufficient way. The second aim was to find out and to assess the knowledge of police officers who are officially assigned to District Departments of the Regional Police Directorate of the South Bohemian Region in the field <b>of</b> emergency <b>management</b> and the third aim was to process the draft of methodology according which the special training of police officers how to solve emergency events (fulfilment of task of Standard Activities within the IRS) and crisis situations would be conducted. Two hypotheses were set while elaborating this thesis: 1. Legal regulations of the Czech Republic and internal <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the Police of the Czech Republic valid on the territory of the South-Bohemian Region applying to the operation of the Police of the Czech Republic as one of the main unit of the IRS solve sufficiently managing emergency events and crisis situations. 2. Police officers officially assigned to District Departments of the Regional Police Directorate of the South Bohemian Region are aware sufficiently of the issue <b>of</b> emergency <b>management,</b> Standard Activities <b>of</b> Units within the IRS {{in the case of a}} joint intervention. The legal regulations of the Czech Republic, internal <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the Ministry of Interior, the Police of the Czech Republic and documentary sources which deal with this issue were used to find out whether the legal regulations cover sufficiently the matters of operation of the Police of the Czech Republic as one of the main unit of the Integrated Rescue System. It was found out and that after these sources had been processed that the Czech legal regulations and internal <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> to the level of guidelines of Police Presidium cover this issue sufficiently, however the guideline issued by the Director of the Regional Police Directorate of the South Bohemian Region solves the training in the periodicity of 3 years whereas it concerns only Managers of District Departments...|$|R

This paper found that many debates arise especially on the position <b>of</b> private zakat <b>management</b> that has to work under the coordination <b>of</b> semi-governmental zakat <b>management.</b> Many data has shown that private zakat management has reached tremendous achievement compared to the semi-governmental zakat management. Based on this fact, this paper argues that zakat institutions in Indonesia needs to be managed properly without sacrificing the social capital i. e. the participation <b>of</b> private zakat <b>management.</b> This paper proposes that private zakat management needs to be given more spaces in optimizing the collecting and distributing zakat funds in Indonesia. The answer for this problem is building the regulator body for zakat management in Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|The {{system of}} joint {{property}} reveals, apart of positive features, several vices as well. These are particularly conspicious in {{the aspect of}} managing joint property and spouses' liability for debts. Complications can appear especially in those situations when family owned producing firms {{are a part of}} joint property. If one can nevertheless adopt a possibly wide understanding <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> ordinary <b>management</b> <b>of</b> joint property, then family owned producing firms can efficiently operate within joint property of a normally functioning family. The system enables the spouses to use profits derived from such firms already in the time of joint property existence. Only in case of the most important acts as alienation, burdening and several others the cooperation of spouses must be required. In absence <b>of</b> consent for <b>management</b> between spouses, the spouse whose rights in joined property are being injured can demand a protection provided by law. Yet the spouse devoid of appropriate qualifications or a trade license is not competent to demand a court ruling depriving the second spouse <b>of</b> <b>management</b> rights in joint property (art. 40 of Family and Guardianship Gode F. G. C.). He can only demand to have the spouse obliged to divide profits derived from running a family owned producing firm, and also in case of damage incurred by <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> the spouse, to have him redress ithe damage, on the grounds of art. 415 of Givi] Code (C.
