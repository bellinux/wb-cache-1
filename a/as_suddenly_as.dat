25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{report of}} a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut. The church grew dark as it padded {{up and down the}} aisle, as if looking for someone. The dog then vanished <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it had appeared.|$|E
25|$|After that, Popov hears a human baby crying. Popov {{tries to}} locate {{the source of the}} sound but the crying stops <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it started. Since infants are not allowed to leave Earth, Popov assumes he had an {{auditory}} hallucination. Popov carries on his work with the robots. Now, he hears a female voice pleading for help from somebody named Shura. Popov cannot locate the source of the voice either.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> they appeared, the {{tourists}} vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but {{the tourists}} reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

60|$|Behind {{their backs}} {{was a small}} window, with a wheel {{ventilator}} {{in one of the}} panes, which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling sound, <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> stop, and <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> start again.|$|R
25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles was not trying to explain evolution.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} no factors {{inhibiting}} the development of Celia, the storm unexpectedly weakened again later on June23. The storm's eye rapidly dissipated and the central dense overcast became asymmetric. Forecaster Todd Kimberlain at the NHC referred to the unexplained shifts in strength as [...] "puzzling." [...] However, <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> the weakening took place, strengthening ensued. Very strong convection formed over {{the center of the}} storm, with some cloud tops being as cold as , but no eye had reformed by the morning of June24. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized, with the eye fully reforming and the structure becoming more symmetrical. Rapid intensification soon followed as the storm reached Category4 status, becoming {{one of only a handful}} of tropical cyclones to do so during the month of June in the eastern Pacific. That evening, the storm further intensified into a Category5 hurricane, the second storm to reach this strength during June in the Eastern Pacific basin on record. Hurricane Celia attained its peak intensity around 0000UTC, with sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). The storm also displayed a well-defined eye estimated to be [...] in diameter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the poem came when Boberg was walking home from church near Kronobäck, Sweden, and listening to church bells. A sudden storm got Boberg’s attention, and then just <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it had made its appearance, it subsided to a peaceful calm which Boberg observed over Mönsterås Bay. According to J. Irving Erickson: ...|$|E

2500|$|The battle {{action on}} 8 May, as Astorias {{executive}} officer, Commander Chauncey R. Crutcher, recounted, [...] "was short and {{was accompanied by}} intense anti-aircraft fire against a determined enemy...." [...] Astoria assisted in putting up a protective barrage over Lexington at the outset, and after the task forces separated, she shifted to the anti-aircraft umbrella over Yorktown. Her gunners claimed to have splashed at least four enemy planes in the attack that [...] "seemed to end <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it had started." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctor and}} his wife with their new [...] "family" [...] make {{their way back to}} the doctor's house, where they {{establish}} a mutually supportive permanent home. The next day, just <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> his sight had been lost, the Japanese man recovers his sight. As the friends all celebrate, the doctor's wife stands out on the porch, staring up into a white overcast sky and seems to be going blind until the camera shifts downwards, revealing that she sees the cityscape.|$|E
2500|$|He {{moved from}} the cathedral to the collegiate church of St. Martin, also in Tours, where he became a subdeacon in 1465. [...] Johannes Ockeghem was {{treasurer}} at that institution, and the two composers seem to {{have known each other}} well. [...] Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers, where he not only became master of the choirboys but managed to attract a flood of talented singers from the entire region; by this time his reputation as singing teacher, scholar and composer seems to have spread widely. [...] But he departed in 1466 just <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> he came for no known reason, and the former master was given his old job back. [...] He then moved to Burgundy.|$|E
50|$|Some {{academic}} {{scholars have}} argued {{to varying degrees}} that Christianity and Judaism did not separate <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> or <b>as</b> dramatically as sometimes thought and {{that the idea of}} two messiahs, one suffering, the second fulfilling the traditional messianic role, was normative to ancient Judaism, in fact predating Jesus. Furthermore, Jesus would have been viewed as fulfilling this role.|$|R
60|$|At {{four o'clock}} that {{afternoon}} Jimmy Torrance collapsed at his desk. The flu had struck him <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> and <b>as</b> unexpectedly {{as it had}} attacked many of its victims. Edith Hudson found him, and immediately notified Mr. Compton, {{with the result that}} half an hour later Jimmy Torrance was in a small private hospital in Park Avenue.|$|R
60|$|Betty's {{face had}} colored warmly at her brother's first question; it toned down {{slightly}} when {{she understood that}} he was not going to tease her <b>as</b> usual, and <b>suddenly,</b> <b>as</b> she looked over his head, it paled white as snow.|$|R
2500|$|By nightfall the English Trader {{was some}} {{five miles from}} the convoy and at times laboured to achieve 4 knots. The crew were apprehensive; a lame duck, such as their predicament was, made easy {{pickings}} for enemy U-boats and aircraft alike. The situation was made worse when, in the darkness, the convoy ahead came under attack. The night sky lit up as the aerial attack commenced. Almost <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it had started, {{the attack on the}} convoy stopped and again all around the English Trader became veiled in darkness. The next few moments were a terrifying experience for the crew with the ominous sound and shape of a Dornier Do 17 bomber attacking the ship. The gunner aboard English Trader opened up at the approaching aircraft. The crew watched as the bomber released two bombs, which [...] narrowly missed the ship. Two huge large pillars of white foam rose as high as her mast on the port side just yards from the ship. The bomber now swooped over the ship and into the darkness to prepare for another attack. Much to the surprise of the crew, HMS Vesper had broken off from the main convoy to help. Vesper opened fire on the aircraft, possibly damaging it as it broke off its attack and was not seen again.|$|E

60|$|They {{might have}} gone on that way half the night, picking up the rescuers, only, {{at the very moment}} when the tenth load of people left for the shore,--just <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> and saucily <b>as</b> you please, up came the Mariposa Belle from the mud bottom and floated.|$|R

5000|$|The {{collapse}} of the USSR and subsequent opening of the region {{has led to an}} intense investment and development scramble by international oil companies.

50|$|Judaism {{is known}} to allow for {{multiple}} messiahs; the two most relevant are Messiah ben Joseph and the traditional Messiah ben David.

60|$|The Prince's genial smile vanished. His {{face grew}} <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> dark as thunder. The Muscovite crept out unawares. There was a fierce light in his eyes, {{and his face}} was like the face of a wolf; yet his voice when he spoke was low.|$|R
60|$|While {{he still}} {{stared at her}} she was <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> gone <b>as</b> she had come, and he {{remained}} with his book, which the meaning had <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> left. There was no meaning in her words, except {{as he put it}} into them, and after he had got it in he struggled with it in a sort of perfunctory incredulity. It was not impossible; it chiefly seemed so because it seemed too good to be true; and the more he pondered it the more possible, if not probable, it became. He could not be safe with it till he had submitted it to his wife; and he went to her while he was sure of repeating Ellen's words without varying from them a syllable.|$|R
