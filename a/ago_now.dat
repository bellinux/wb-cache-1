5|$|Ten years later, Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) {{returns home}} from {{boarding}} school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers (Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth) concerned Rahul's adoption {{and the reason}} why Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and her younger sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to London, and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree to let him go. In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish. Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that he has come to London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. Right before the family attends Krish's school functin, Sayeeda and Anjali find out his real identity, though they promise to keep quiet. At Krish's school function, Krish leads his class in singing Jana Gana Mana (Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this advice ten years <b>ago,</b> <b>now</b> realizes that Rohan is his brother.|$|E

25|$|Over time, the mages became {{filled with}} hubris, and began {{fighting}} over {{how best to}} lead the world. The battle separated the Earth into the Fallen World and the Supernal Realm, with the chasm of the Abyss in between. The Fallen World is the world where humanity now exists, and the Supernal realm is the realm of magic, where the victorious mages of long <b>ago</b> <b>now</b> reside. The Abyss that separates the two worlds prevents most of humanity from awakening to magic, and hampers the power of mages trapped in the Fallen World.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{commenting on}} the success American Idiot brought the band, Sam Bayer, {{director}} of all of American Idiots music videos, stated [...] "The Billie Joe that I work with {{now is not the}} same guy that walked onto the American Idiot set a year <b>ago.</b> <b>Now,</b> he's a rock star. They were famous.They had done big stuff. But it's transcended that. [...] But he hasn't changed. And they haven't changed. They're three friends who love one another". Courtney Love also commented on the success of the band, stating [...] "Billie Joe looks absolutely beautiful. You know how when people get super A-list, their face gets prettier? I think it's perception. [...] It's something that happens in your subconscious". At the time of American Idiots release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Slayer {{decided that a}} music video should be filmed, touring {{commitments}} prevented their involvement in the actual shoot. Instead, others were contacted to produce the film. Director Tony Petrossian presented Slayer with the first draft, and the group made a few suggestions for improvement. Never having met him, King recalled Petrossian [...] "had a treatment, and we all dug the treatment so we just turned him loose." [...] "Eyes of the Insane"'s war-themed music video was filmed on August 13, 2006, in the Los Angeles area. Casting company Tolley Casparis Casting sought a male Caucasian {{between the ages of}} 18 and 26 to appear in the clip, with auditions held on August 10, 2006. The official project notes deemed that [...] "This guy must be a serious actor, capable of emoting everything through his eyes. He was innocent a few months <b>ago,</b> <b>now</b> he is scarred by seeing so much fighting. Strong eyebrows that do not overpower the face. Scars or large veins actually a plus." ...|$|E
500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside minor elements like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel a little out of time. You couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years <b>ago,</b> <b>now</b> or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of interesting things to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E

500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years <b>ago.</b> <b>Now</b> is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{a decade}} <b>ago</b> <b>now,</b> in 2008, Loyola {{students}} {{revealed to the}} legal tabloid Above the Law that Loyola had recently adopted a policy of excluding any student from participating in the school's on-campus interviewing (OCI) program if he had applied to transfer to other law schools. The exclusion applied even if a student's transfer application was still pending during OCI {{and even if the}} student had already paid tuition to Loyola for the next semester. In response to the Above the Law article, Loyola Dean Victor Gold wrote in a campus-wide e-mail that Above the Law [...] "misrepresents our policy, omits some key facts, and gets others wrong." [...] The purpose of the policy, Gold wrote, was to prevent transferring students from [...] "double-dipping" [...] by interviewing both at Loyola and at their new school. Furthermore, any student whose transfer application was rejected could apply for reinstatement in the OCI program. However, Above the Law noted that Gold did not dispute that Loyola banned tuition-paying students whose applications were still pending from participating in OCI. This policy was repealed soon thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|The city of Boston hired Zebbler for its 2014 New Year's {{celebrations}} {{to create}} a light show—and paid him US$50,000 for his services. Zebbler said {{he felt it was}} an honor to be selected and help bring unity to the city. Zebbler's light show production was the centerpiece of the 2014 Boston First Night event held in Copley Square. When interviewed by the Boston Herald about the choice of Zebbler for the 2014 First Night, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said, [...] "We're a forgiving city." [...] Attorney General Martha Coakley also felt that paying Zebbler for the light production in 2014 was a good choice. Coakley went on to defend the actions of law enforcement from 2007: [...] "This was several years <b>ago</b> <b>now.</b> Those two young men had been hired by a company to do some guerrilla advertising. At the time, particularly in its proximity to 9/11, I think the City and Boston Police were very concerned. I think we responded appropriately at the time, but I think we also saw the company immediately make compensation to the City of Boston and to the Boston Police for the efforts involved." ...|$|E
