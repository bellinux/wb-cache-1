5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|Citygarden's plants, {{including}} various {{grasses and}} wildflowers, were {{selected by the}} Missouri Botanical Garden. Large shade plants were chosen to provide relief in warm <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> weather. At {{the time of its}} opening, Citygarden comprised a total of 240 trees, 1,100 shrubs, 4,000 perennials, 8,000 bulbs, and 13,000 groundcovers. A garden spokesperson later said that hungry rabbits have forced workers to alter some of the plant choices.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels can be very high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot <b>and</b> <b>humid,</b> while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (Do).

5|$|As {{a part of}} Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a {{tropical}} rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> all year round, averaging from 28°C to 30°C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea hsomehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
5|$|Flagstaff has {{a rather}} dry semi-continental climate (Köppen Dsb/Csb). Flagstaff has five {{distinct}} seasons: {{a cold and}} snowy winter, with extended dry periods punctuated by deep snows about once every 3–4 weeks; a dry and windy spring with occasional snows; a very dry and hot early summer from May to early July; a wet <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> monsoon season from July to early September; and a dry and pleasant fall which lasts until the first snows in November.|$|E
5|$|Several notable Tyrannosaurus remains {{have been}} found in the Hell Creek Formation. During the Maastrichtian this area was subtropical, with a warm <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> climate.

5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E

The high humidity levels with dew points in the 70s°F (low 20s°C), temperatures that in many areas were near 80°F (27°C), strong wind shear {{and the presence of}} the dry line helped develop the instability to produce severe thunderstorms across the Midwest and Southern Plains on October 17.|$|E

5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E
