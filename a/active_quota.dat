50|$|Each {{state party}} is obligated to receive {{observation}} flights per its passive quota allocation. Each state party may conduct as many observation flights - its <b>active</b> <b>quota</b> - as its passive quota. During {{the first three}} years after entry into force, each state will be obligated to accept no more than seventy-five percent of its passive quota. Since the overall annual passive quota for the United States is 42, this means that it will be obligated to accept no more than 31 observation flights a year during this three-year period. Only two flights were requested over the United States during 2005, by the Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus Group of states parties (which functions as a single entity for quota allocation purposes). The United States is entitled to 8 of the 31 annual flights available over Russia/Belarus. Additionally, the United States is entitled to one flight over Ukraine, which is shared with Canada.|$|E

When <b>quotas</b> are <b>active,</b> a <b>quota</b> group is automatically created with each new subvolume or snapshot. These initial quota groups are building blocks which can be grouped (with the [...] command) into hierarchies to implement quota pools.|$|R

Bureaucratization of all sectors of society, including education, increases pseudoinnovation trends, especially in the regions. Power crisis is caused by the traditions based on manipulation by social benefits, centralized multiGlevel control, distribution and redistribution of cash flows and <b>quotas,</b> <b>active</b> exploitation of peopleâ€™s slave psychology. Change of this situation is associated with a change in management forms that keep encouraging dependency, paperwork, monitoring, distributive and redistributive features preventing the effects of selfGorganization...|$|R
