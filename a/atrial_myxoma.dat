40|$|We {{present the}} results of a 12 -year {{retrospective}} analysis of 11 patients, eight women and three men, aged 16 - 76 years, with pathologically documented <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas.</b> Nine of the 11 patients were found to have a left atrial myxoma; right <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas</b> were identified in two. Five of the 11 patients (45 %) had abnormalities on neurologic examination, and five of five had computed tomographic evidence of nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction. Neurologic symptoms were the initial presentation in four patients. Six patients reported a history of cardiac disease; eight of the 11 had abnormalities on cardiac auscultation. Echocardiography in 10 patients was diagnostic in all but one. Gated magnetic resonance imaging of the heart in two patients demonstrated myxoma position and movement. Follow-up examinations (varying from 1 month to 7 years after tumor resection) in nine of 11 patients demonstrated no recurrent neurologic symptoms. Cerebral infarction is a common complication of <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas</b> and may be the presenting feature. Recurrent cerebral emboli before surgery is not uncommon.

50|$|About 75% of myxomas {{occur in}} the left atrium of the heart, usually {{beginning}} in the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas</b> express antigens suggesting a neural origin. DESIGN [...] A retrospective analysis based on immunohistochemical examination of myxoma tissue. SETTING [...] <b>Atrial</b> <b>myxomas</b> excised by two tertiary referral cardiothoracic surgical units. SUBJECTS [...] 24 excised <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas.</b> Three were from known cases of familial myxoma syndrome. METHODS [...] Immunohistochemical identifications of three neuroendocrine markers (protein gene product (PGP) 9. 5, neurone specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin) and S 100 antigen; CD 34 and von Willebrand factor; and chi smooth muscle actin to identify possible Schwann cell differentiation, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells respectively. RESULTS [...] The myxoma cells were PGP 9. 5 positive in 18, S 100 positive in 16, and NSE positive in 12. Of the 12 NSE positive myxomas seven were synaptophysin positive. All tumours that were NSE positive were also S 100 and PGP 9. 5 positive. The tumour surface was partially covered by myxoma cells, partly by endothelial cells. CONCLUSION [...] The histological appearances of myxomas with stellate cells {{embedded within a}} loose connective tissue stroma, abundant basophil cell infiltration, {{and the presence of}} pericellular type IV collagen are similar to nerve sheath tumours (neurofibromas) at other sites. A significant proportion of myxomas also express Schwann cell and neuroendocrine differentiation markers. These features cannot prove the origin of myxomas because tumours may develop aberrant phenotype expression but they do accord with the view that myxomas originate from endocardial sensory nerve tissue...|$|R

40|$|Myxomas are {{the most}} common type of cardiac tumours in all age groups {{accounting}} for one-third to one-half of cases at postmortum and for about three quarter of tumours treated surgically. Most <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas,</b> whether left or right, arise from the atrial septum. About 10 % have other sites of origin, particularly posterior wall, anterior wall and the appendages (in order of frequency). Myxomas are frequently located in left atrium and produce symptoms when they fragment and cause systemic emboli or when they interfere with cardiac valvular function and cause pulmonary congestion. Careful surgical management of these lesions should be curative with minimal early and late morbidity and mortality. Recurrence of <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas</b> can occur most likely in about 3 % of patients. However, extensive resection of the <b>myxoma</b> attached to <b>atrial</b> septum or atrial wall can reduce the likelihood of recurrence to a greater extent.

40|$|Two {{siblings}} 14 {{years apart}} {{were found to}} have atrial myxomas. The brother's right <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> was found at age 21 and his sister's left <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma,</b> with peripheral cerebral and coronary aneurysms, at age 30. Both tumors were excised successfully. These findings support previous reports suggesting that <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> may be familial.

40|$|Although rare, left <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> is {{an entity}} from anatomopathological and {{clinical}} aspects. Seven cases of left <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> operated {{on the last}} ten years were reviewed. We also report a rare presentation of right <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma,</b> where the tumor was responsible of a dramatic hemodynamic shock due to right ventricular inflow obstruction. Six patients were female, {{with a mean age of}} 53 years. All but one consulted for exertional dyspnea of recent onset. Two patients with left <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> and the patient with right <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> had experienced embolism. Five patients had systemic symptoms. Echocardiography was the most performant diagnostic procedure. All but the patient with right <b>atrial</b> <b>myxoma</b> were operated by the left atrial access. The mitral valve was replaced in two patients. The histological aspect of this benign tumor is illustrated but the lack of frank border between the tumor and the myocardium is emphasized. We conclude that surgical management is primordial. We give anatomopathological rationale for resection of implantation pedicle. The operative mortality was nul in this series of 8 patients; major improvement of cardiac status was constant. No recurrence has occurred during the follow-up period. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 46 patients with cardiac thrombi, 15 patients with <b>atrial</b> <b>myxomas,</b> and 32 patients with other cardiac or paracardiac tumors. Diagnoses were subsequently proven by surgery, autopsy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography in all patients. All patients underwent precordial and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardi-ography to assess the various mass detection rates. <b>Atrial</b> <b>myxomas</b> and predominantly left-sided cardiac tumors were identified by both echocardiographic techniques with compara-ble detection rates. Left ventricular apical thrombi were detected more frequently by precordial echocardiography. In contrast, transesophageal echocardiography was superior in visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi, small and flat thrombi in the left atrial cavity, thrombi and tumors in the superior vena cava, and masses attached to the right heart and the descending thoracic aorta. These data indicate that transesophageal echocardiography leads to a clinically relevant improvement of the diagnostic potential in patients in whom cardiac masses are suspected or have to be excluded in order {{to ensure the safety of}} clinical procedures.
