5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Howard gets a {{call from}} her sister, who has {{recently}} found a tumor on her breast. The sister has just learned her husband has been having an affair. Although Howard is initially hesitant to confide in Felton, he eventually surprises her by offering genuine words of comfort. A drunken man dressed as Santa Claus (Cleve Wall) is arrested for threatening his wife and {{a crowd of people}} with a water pistol. Later, the detectives get <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after falling through the ceiling and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal. Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case. As the new day dawns, Gee has the detectives assemble on the roof so he can spray them with a garden hose to cool them off.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{challenge}} is invoked, acknowledged, and agreed, the Third Umpire reviews the play. The Third Umpire then reports to the on-field umpire whether his analysis supports the original call, contradicts the call, or is inconclusive. The on-field umpire then makes the final decision: either re-signalling <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> is standing or revoking <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> is being reversed and then making the corrected signal. Only clearly incorrect decisions are reversed; if the Third Umpire's analysis is within established margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, the on-field umpire's original call stands.|$|E

25|$|Kōsuke Fujishima's manga series Ah! My Goddess {{featured}} {{a play on}} Schrödinger's Cat. During one storyline, a storage room was expanded to infinite proportions and the main characters encountered a Schrödinger's Whale, an extremely rare species {{with the ability to}} travel through space-time in a five-dimensional quantum state. The male lead in the series, Keiichi Morisato, befriends the whale and teaches it songs by real-life musical group The Carpenters (in the original English translation, it was Matthew Sweet) - but their time spent together is short, for the whale must move on or risk its safety as its wave function collapses. Because of this need to keep moving through quantum states, Schrödinger's Whales hardly ever meet, the reason they are so thin on the ground— but miraculously, Keiichi secured the future of the species by teaching it the songs. After discovering the whale had gone, he found out that it had learned Only Yesterday by itself (Missing Time in the translation) - this gave the whales <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> they could locate each other by.|$|E

500|$|The great spotted kiwi is nocturnal in behaviour. If the kiwis {{live in an}} area lacking predators, {{they will}} {{come out in the}} day. At night, they come out to feed. Like other species of kiwi, they have a good sense of smell, which is unusual in birds. Males are {{fiercely}} territorial. At most, four to five kiwis live in a square kilometre. One pair's territory can be [...] in size. It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size. They will call, chase, or fight intruders out. Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls, hisses, and bill snapping. Great spotted kiwi males have <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> resembles a warbling whistle, while the female call is harsh raspy, and also warbling.|$|E
500|$|The female corn crake {{may give}} <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> {{is similar to}} that of the male; it also has a {{distinctive}} barking sound, similar in rhythm to the main call but without the grating quality. The female also has a high-pitched cheep call, and a oo-oo-oo sound to call the chick. The chicks make a quiet peeick-peeick contact call, and a chirp used to beg for food. Because of the difficulty in seeing this species, it is usually censused by counting males calling between 11pm and 3am; the birds do not move much at night, whereas they may wander up to [...] during the day, which could lead to double-counting if monitored then. Identifying individual males suggests that just counting calling birds underestimates the true count by nearly 30%, and the discrepancy is likely to be greater, since only 80% of males may call at all on a given night. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E
500|$|The {{internal}} {{structures of}} the crest of Corythosaurus are quite complex, making possible <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> {{could be used for}} warning or attracting a mate. Nasal passageways of Corythosaurus, as well as Hypacrosaurus and Lambeosaurus are S-shaped, with Parasaurolophus only possessing U-shaped tubes. Any vocalization would travel through these elaborate chambers, and probably get amplified. Scientists speculate that Corythosaurus could make loud, low pitched cries [...] "like a wind or brass instrument", such as a trombone. The sounds could serve to alert other Corythosaurus to the presence of food or a potential threat from a predator. The nasal passages emit low-frequency sounds when Corythosaurus exhaled. The individual crests would produce different sounds, so it is likely that each species of lambeosaurine would have had a unique sound. However, even though the range for different lambeosaurine nasal passages vary, they all probable made low-pitched sounds. This might be because low sounds (below 400 Hz) travel a set distance in any environment, while higher (above 400 Hz) sounds have a larger spread in the distance travelled.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to make desecration of the Australian flag a crime.

Michael Cobb introduced private member's bills in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 to ban desecration, but on each occasion the bill lapsed. In 2002, the leader of the National Party, John Anderson, proposed to introduce laws banning desecration of the Australian flag, <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> attracted support from some parliamentarians both in his own party and the senior Coalition partner, the Liberal Party.

In 2003, the Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill was tabled in Parliament by Trish Draper without support from Howard and subsequently lapsed. In 2006, following a flag-burning incident during the 2005 Cronulla riots and a burnt flag display by a Melbourne artist, Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop introduced the Protection of the Australian National Flag (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2006. This bill sought to make it [...] "a criminal offence to wilfully destroy or otherwise mutilate the Flag in circumstances where a reasonable person would infer that the destruction or mutilation is intended publicly to express contempt or disrespect for the Flag or the Australian Nation."
