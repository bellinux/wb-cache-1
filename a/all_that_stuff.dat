[...] In 2007, he returned as a novelist to California, where some of his earlier fiction had been set, with You Don't Love Me Yet, a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics. [...] According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called [...] "the unformed posturing phase of life".

500|$|In 1972, Benn {{said in his}} diaries that [...] "Today I had {{the idea}} that I would resign my Privy Councillorship, my MA and all my honorary doctorates in order to strip myself of what the world had to offer".

I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time." [...] In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to [...] "Tony Benn". Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that [...] "Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie {{in the case of the}} tabloids, for years to come (some older Tories were still doing so three decades later)." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy {{you want to see}} fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E

[...] The songs that Wengren was referring to were [...] "Perfect Insanity", and [...] "Divide". The band also recorded a version of the song [...] "Midlife Crisis", which was originally performed by Faith No More. Draiman comments, [...] "We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer." [...] However, the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album, and is instead featured on Covered, A Revolution in Sound.

500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like you can do <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She {{also noted that the}} album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the project's lead {{programmer}} Ed Boon, Mortal Kombat II was [...] "intended to {{look different}} than the original MK" [...] and [...] "had everything we wanted to put into MK but {{did not have time}} for." [...] In 2012, Boon placed creating the game among his best Mortal Kombat memories, recalling: [...] "When we did Mortal Kombat II, we got new equipment and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> but it was funny because when we started working on Mortal Kombat II, the mania, the hysteria of the home versions of Mortal Kombat I was literally all around us. We were so busy working on the next one, going from seven characters to 12 and two Fatalities per character and all these other things that that consumed every second." [...] Both the theme and art style of MKII were slightly darker than those of its predecessor, although a more vibrant color palette was employed and the new game had a much richer color depth than the previous game. A new feature was the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling in the arcade version. The game was made to be less serious with the addition of humorous alternative finishing moves.

500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website describes the character as the [...] "powerful millionaire-tycoon {{with a secret}} agenda to take everything from his long-lost mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)." [...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E

500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and I listen to a lot of pop, but I listen to everything from Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. I think <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> shows up in my music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they saw me as somebody ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness. And I stand guilty on those counts." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E

So we decided to do an {{extended}} dance mix of 'Warrior'. That was a serious club anthem at the time." [...] "It's too easy to do an atypical Public Image-type record - big, crashing drums and whooping great imitation reggae basslines. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff's</b> been done and I don't wanna do it any more. I'm much more interested in other directions. Now, if people conceive that as being commercial on my part, then I'd like them to define commercial because the record sales really aren't that hot. But we are imitated, and I think you'll find quite a lot of '9'-sounding albums out there in the charts next year, all of them no doubt hogging the Top 10 spot." ...|$|R
2500|$|On the album’s evolution, Rygg commented, [...] "I {{was pretty}} set on keeping it more bare this time. When we did Blood Inside, we'd been holding back with <b>all</b> <b>that</b> minimal <b>stuff</b> {{for so long}} — the soundtracks (Lyckantropen Themes and Svidd neger), the Silence EPs and <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> So Blood Inside was an {{outburst}} of sorts.
