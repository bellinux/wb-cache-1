5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E

25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Chinese governments (both ROC and PRC) in the negotiation {{process of the}} San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT) nullified any legal binding power of the SFPT on China, including any act of renouncing or disposing of sovereignty. In addition, the fact that neither ROC nor PRC government ever ratified SFPT terms, prescribes that the SFPT is irrelevant to <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> Chinese sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> {{planetary}} interactive forces {{has always}} started historically with the two-body problem. The {{purpose of this}} Section is to relate the real complexity in calculating any planetary forces.

25|$|Drum {{returned}} to Washington in 1933 {{to serve as}} deputy to the Army's Chief of Staff, Douglas MacArthur. He headed a board of senior officers that again sought to suppress advocates of an independent air force by setting the ceiling on Air Corps requirements for numbers of aircraft and tying any funding for expansion of the Air Corps to prior funding of the other branches first. In 1934 {{all the members of}} the Drum Board also sat on the presidential-initiated Baker Board, again setting its agenda to preclude <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> air force independence.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Sassoon's conflict, the opening {{chapters of the}} novel describe the suffering of other soldiers in the hospital. Anderson, a former surgeon, now cannot stand the sight of blood. Haunted by terrible hallucinations after being thrown into the air by an explosion and landing head first in the ruptured stomach of a rotting dead soldier, Burns experiences a revulsion to eating. Another patient, Billy Prior, suffers from mutism and will only write communications with Rivers on a notepad. Prior eventually regains his voice, but remains a difficult patient for Rivers avoiding <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> his war memories.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} degree of inter-provincial {{variation in the}} Canadian Paramedic practice. Although a national consensus (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of Paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders. For this reason, <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> Paramedic Practice in Canada is necessarily broad, and general. Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to Paramedic practice can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial Paramedic Associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis.|$|E

25|$|On the Union side, Rosecrans held {{a council}} {{of war with}} most of his corps and {{division}} commanders to determine {{a course of action}} for September 20. The Army of the Cumberland had been significantly hurt in the first day's battle and had only five fresh brigades available, whereas the Confederate army had been receiving reinforcements and now outnumbered the Federals. Both of these facts ruled out a Union offensive. The presence of Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana at the meeting made <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> retreating difficult. Rosecrans decided that his army had to remain in place, on the defensive. He recalled that Bragg had retreated after Perryville and Stones River and could conceivably repeat that behavior.|$|E
25|$|White abolitionists did {{not always}} face {{agreeable}} communities in the North. Garrison was almost lynched in Boston while newspaper publisher Elijah Lovejoy was killed in Alton, Illinois. The anger over abolition even spilled over into Congress where a gag rule was instituted to prevent <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> slavery {{on the floor of}} either chamber. Most whites viewed African-Americans as an inferior race and had little taste for abolitionists, often assuming that all were like Garrison. African-Americans had little freedom even in states where slavery was not permitted, being shunned by whites, subjected to discriminatory laws, and often forced to compete with Irish immigrants for menial, low-wage jobs. In the South meanwhile, planters argued that slavery was necessary to operate their plantations profitably and that emancipated slaves would attempt to Africanize the country as they had done in Haiti.|$|E
25|$|The CHP and MHP both {{initially}} {{refused to}} join a coalition with the AKP, but later indicated interest in entering negotiations. An AKP-CHP coalition was seen {{as one of the}} most likely scenarios and was supported by the financial sector. An AKP-MHP coalition was also seen as likely due to ideological similarities, though the two parties differ strongly on the issue of the Solution process. The MHP set out its red lines for any coalition deal to be the end of <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> a presidential system, the end of the solution process, the safeguarding of Turkish identity in any new constitutional settlement and the re-opening of suppressed corruption cases. The party's leader Devlet Bahçeli also demanded that Erdoğan should either resign or strictly keep to the constitutional limits of his position as President. In contrast, the AKP initially put forward three non-compromisable conditions on any coalition, which include the continuation of the solution process, the continuation of the government's efforts to purge the political power of the Gülen Movement and the refusal to compromise on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's conduct as President. On 11 June, the AKP appeared to backtrack on their support for an executive presidency, with leader Ahmet Davutoğlu stating that he was not against the current parliamentary system. Davutoğlu also claimed that the AKP did not have any non-negotiable conditions for a coalition despite earlier contradictory reports.|$|E

500|$|Desert Strike {{underwent}} {{few changes}} from the plans {{outlined in the}} original design documents. The initial concept involved smoothly animated vehicles on an isometric playing field. The developers also aimed to include cinematic scenes, similar to The Revenge of Shinobis introduction sequence. The game began development some time before <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> an American invasion of Iraq, originally based on the Lebanese Civil War and titled Beirut Breakout; this was later changed to the Persian Gulf region. John Manley recalled, [...] "We actually wrote most of Desert Strike before Desert Shield happened. We were watching CNN {{at three in the}} afternoon {{and all of a sudden}} it was like, 'Oh my god - it's happening!'" [...] A special point system intended to punish players was omitted; the system would have deducted points from the player's score if they destroyed objects that resulted in negative economic and political results. The control scheme was not well received at internal reviews of the game's early versions, and Posehn had to alter his original design to obtain approval for further development.|$|E
500|$|The cap of M.intersecta is {{initially}} conical to convex to bell-shaped, eventually reaching [...] in diameter. When it is moist, it is partly translucent, {{so that the}} outlines of the gills underneath the cap can be seen. The cap is somewhat hygrophanous, and dry. Its surface {{is initially}} minutely [...] (as if covered with a fine white powder), but this effect soon sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth. The cap color is initially olive-brown to yellowish-brown, then somewhat paler from the margin. The white flesh is up to 0.7mm thick, and lacks any distinctive taste and odor. The slender stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cylindrical, and hollow. Its surface is dry, and colored pale olive-brown near the top, becoming olive-brown downward. Like the cap, it is at first pruinose, but smooths out in age. The base of the stem is covered with coarse white hairs. The gills are adnate to subdecurrent (running slightly {{down the length of the}} stem), and distantly spaced, with 16–19 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.5mm broad, thin, somewhat intervenose, and whitish, with edges that are the same color as the gill faces.

500|$|When the Persians arrived off {{the coast}} of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry {{that they would not be}} able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been {{expelled}} at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: [...] "Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others." [...] The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.|$|E
