5|$|For a {{long period}} of time the project was {{entitled}} Trolley Blues; Cristian Nemescu gave up this title, worrying that there might be a large discrepancy between the equivocal name <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual,</b> very direct content of the movie.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Gaming World, L.S. Lichtmann {{wrote that}} {{development}} of {{some aspects of}} the game was left incomplete. He observed that some promotional screenshots do not resemble anything players encounter in the actual game and that a pamphlet included in the game box lists a large number of differences between what is written in the manual <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those previously mentioned, the film also featured Dan Haggerty, who starred in the television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. He provided the fighting dog, {{played the role of}} the dog's trainer and worked on the set design <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> restoration of the carousel.|$|E

5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed interchange is to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation of the diamond interchange with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> construction.|$|E
5|$|Another taxon that Czerkas {{assigned}} to the pterosauria and named Utahdactylus was reviewed by Dr. Chris Bennett. Bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between Czerkas' diagrams <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> fossils. Bennett found the specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized the previous authors for publishing a species name when no diagnostic characters below the class level could be verified. He made Utahdactylus a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane of the cameras. The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> scene experienced.|$|E

5|$|Halotus is {{primarily}} remembered for his suspected {{involvement in the}} conspiracy and poisoning of Emperor Claudius on 13 October (times of death are in dispute; see below) 54 AD. It is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> manner of the poisoning, in regards to which poison may have been used, in which food {{it could have been}} hidden, etc., remains unclear. It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was known to have been particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought to have been the most likely to have instigated the murder or to have been the lead conspirator in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|In this {{conception}} of mind no strict distinction is {{made between the}} conscious faculty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental phenomena. The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (manovijñāna) and attention (āvartana), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.|$|E

5|$|No {{additional}} SPUs {{were set}} up in 1992, regardless of discrepancies between the November 1991 reorganisation scheme <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> order of battle of the special police. Two additional SPUs {{were set up}} and assigned to the Koprivnica-Križevci and Požega-Slavonia police administrations in 1993. Following a reorganisation of the force carried out in 2001, the regionally based units were amalgamated into four units—Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. At the same time, the special police was reduced to 300 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{buoyancy}} of a diving cylinder during the dive {{can be more}} problematic with side-mounted cylinders, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may {{be separated from the}} diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed that provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.|$|E

5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> turning radius. Values less than one, where {{the front wheel}} side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} lesser known {{details about the}} Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive. Specific {{physical}} details <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> person behind the wheel are often missed or overlooked. The Wreck is financially maintained through Ramblin' Reck Club appearances and fundraisers. There is no official source of funding from the Institute, Athletic Association, or Alumni Association. This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is atypical amongst college mascots.|$|E
