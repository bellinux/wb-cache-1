5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which <b>amended</b> <b>the</b> 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{structure}} or basic features doctrine holds {{that there is}} an implied restriction on the powers of <b>the</b> legislature to <b>amend</b> <b>the</b> Constitution: it is precluded from <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> basic features of the Constitution. The landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati established that the doctrine applies in India, highlighting that while Parliament's power to <b>amend</b> <b>the</b> Constitution extends to all its sections, essential features of the Constitution must not be altered.|$|R

5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It <b>amended</b> <b>the</b> process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E
5|$|The 5th National Congress again <b>amended</b> <b>the</b> party constitution, {{adding a}} chapter on control {{commissions}} and their aims but devoting little attention to their operations. Partly because of this, the control commissions actively participated in several party rectification campaigns during the late 1920s and early 1930s. At that time the commissions tended to participate in political struggles, most notably the purges of Zhang Guotao and Wang Ming.|$|E

5|$|The House of Lords {{found that}} the Parliament Act 1911 {{did not have any}} {{limitations}} that would prevent it being used to enact the Parliament Act 1949. The 1949 Act had therefore validly <b>amended</b> <b>the</b> requirements for a bill to use the Parliament Acts procedure and the Hunting Act, which was passed in accordance with these amended requirements, was consequently also held to be valid; the appellants' appeal was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment.

5|$|A plan {{to fill in}} {{a section}} of the canal in Nottingham {{resulted}} in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report {{on the state of the}} canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was <b>amended.</b> <b>The</b> Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E
5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors <b>amended</b> <b>the</b> agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E
