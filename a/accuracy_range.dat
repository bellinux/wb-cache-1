500|$|The game {{contains}} weapons {{based on}} non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, {{as well as}} entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> fire rate, damage, and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons {{tend to be more}} cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for [...] "... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function", rather than [...] "... just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles." [...] F.E.A.R.s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.|$|E

For two-class classification, studies described in [8, 12, 14, 23 – 25] classified Set A and Set E, and their <b>accuracies</b> <b>ranged</b> from 92 % to 100 %. Studies described in [26, 27] classified Set E and Sets A, B, C, and D, and their <b>accuracies</b> <b>ranged</b> from 96 % to 97 %. For three-class classification, studies described in [18, 28 – 30] classified Set A, Set D (Set C in [30]), and Set E, and the <b>accuracies</b> <b>ranged</b> from 85 % to 96 %. Finally, the studies described in [31 – 34] classified the five datasetes, and the <b>accuracies</b> <b>ranged</b> from 89 % to 99 %. In our experiments, the seizure detection approaches were also used to classify two additional datasets: Set D and Set E; and Sets A and D and Set E.|$|R
50|$|Fire and Movement became {{particularly}} important when {{more and more}} rifled muskets and breech-loading weapons, later followed by machine guns, were fielded on the battlefields of the 19th century. The increased <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range</b> and rate of fire translated into more firepower, allowing smaller units to operate more independently. This marked the transition from First to Second-generation warfare that saw the increasing application of Fire and Movement on the tactical level.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, an {{upgraded}} version, dubbed [...] "Third Generation of Fateh-110" [...] {{was tested}} by Iran. Iranian defense minister Ahmad Vahidi stated that <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> reaction time and storage capability {{in different parts}} of the country are increased. After that Iranian TV provided footage of the test and the impact. Some time later, it was delivered to IRGC. The range of the missile was stated as 300 km.|$|E
50|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers are frequently equipped with shotguns. In contrast to traditional buckshot, slugs offer {{the benefits of}} <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> and knock-down power while avoiding stray pellets. Further, the shotgun allows the operator to select the desired shell a variety of situations such as a less-lethal cartridge such as a bean bag round or other Less lethal slugs. A traditional rifle would offer greater range and accuracy than slugs, but without the ammunition choices and versatility.|$|E
30|$|Full models Vs. benchmark. Our model {{yields a}} {{weighted}} <b>accuracy</b> <b>ranging</b> between 0.58 (San Francisco – logistic classifier) to 0.72 (San Diego – random forest classifier). Conversely, the benchmark yields an <b>accuracy</b> <b>ranging</b> between 0.49 and 0.60.

50|$|Typical barrels {{are between}} 76 mm and 530 mm long, {{although}} custom barrels may {{be up to}} 910 mm long. Longer barrels are usually quieter than shorter barrels, allowing excess gas to escape slowly. Players usually choose a barrel length between 300 mm and 410 mm, as a compromise between <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> and portability. Many players favor longer barrels as they permit them to push aside the large inflatable bunkers commonly used in paintball tournaments while still staying behind cover.|$|E
5000|$|In 1934, Georg Madelung and Munich-based Paul Schmidt {{proposed}} to the German Air Ministry a [...] "flying bomb" [...] powered by Schmidt's pulsejet. Madelung co-invented the ribbon parachute, a device used to stabilise the V-1 in its terminal dive. Schmidt's prototype bomb {{failed to meet}} German Air Ministry specifications, especially owing to poor <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range</b> and high cost. The original Schmidt design had the pulsejet placed in a fuselage like a modern jet fighter, unlike the eventual V-1 which had the engine placed above the warhead and fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The Repeater {{was tested}} in April 1863 at the 6th Corps {{headquarters}} in Virginia and was praised by a board {{composed of two}} Brigadier-Generals and a Colonel. In their report they stated that they found its simple construction, <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range</b> and rate of fire exactly as had been claimed for it and recommended that initially eight to twelve guns be used per brigade. Brigadier General Pratt, whose experience in action with the Gatling gun had not been satisfactory, endorsed the Rafael Repeater in glowing terms and asked that at least 24 of them be issued to his division.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{set out to}} {{identify}} the significant variables which affect residential low voltage (LV) network demand and develop next day total energy use (NDTEU) and next day peak demand (NDPD) forecast models for each phase. The models were developed using both autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and neural network (NN) techniques. The data used for this research was collected from a LV transformer serving 128 residential customers. It was observed that temperature accounted for half of the residential LV network demand. The inclusion of the double exponential smoothing algorithm, autoregressive terms, relative humidity and {{day of the week}} dummy variables increased model accuracy. In terms of R 2 and for each modelling technique and phase, NDTEU hindcast <b>accuracy</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 77 to 0. 87 and forecast <b>accuracy</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 74 to 0. 84. NDPD hindcast <b>accuracy</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 68 to 0. 74 and forecast <b>accuracy</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 56 to 0. 67. The NDTEU models were more accurate than the NDPD models due to the peak demand time series being more variable in nature. The NN models had slight accuracy gains over the ARIMAX models. A hybrid model was developed which combined the best traits of the ARIMAX and NN techniques, resulting in improved hindcast and forecast fits across the all three phases...|$|R

50|$|As the tank's primary armament, {{they are}} almost always {{employed}} in a direct fire mode to defeat a variety of ground targets at all ranges, including dug-in infantry, lightly armored vehicles, and especially other heavily armored tanks. They must provide <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> penetration, and rapid fire in a package that is as compact and lightweight as possible, to allow mounting in the cramped confines of an armored gun turret. Tank guns generally use self-contained ammunition, allowing rapid loading (or use of an autoloader). They often display a bulge in the barrel, which is a bore evacuator, or a device on the muzzle, which is a muzzle brake.|$|E
5000|$|Bolt-action rifles {{dominate}} the class, {{with a few}} specialized AR-15 variants and single-shot rifles making up the rest. Most bolt-action rifles, if accurized, can be successfully used for varmint hunting. While nearly all varmint guns are rifles, {{there are a few}} pistols, generally single shot and bolt-action pistols in rifle calibers such as those developed for metallic silhouette shooting, that have sufficient <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> and trajectory to allow them to be used for varmint shooting. The Remington XP-100 bolt-action pistol and its aptly named [...]221 Fireball cartridge, introduced in 1963, were developed for varmint hunting; the full name is the [...] "Model XP-100 Varmint Special".|$|E
50|$|In 1964, the U.S. Army started {{replacing}} their M14s {{with the}} M16, incurring another series of complaints from the British. Regardless of the M14 having disadvantages in jungle warfare, 7.62×51mm NATO rifles stayed in military service {{around the world}} due to several factors. The 7.62×51mm NATO has proved much more effective than 5.56×45mm at long ranges, and has since found popularity as a sniping round. For instance, M14 variants such as the Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle and M25 Sniper Rifle were utilized in the United States military as designated marksman and sniper rifles. Shorter, easier to handle 7.62mm rifles like the Heckler & Koch G3 stayed in service due to their <b>accuracy,</b> <b>range,</b> cartridge effectiveness and reliability.|$|E

40|$|Water-level {{measurements}} {{have been}} made in deep boreholes in the Yucca Mountain area, Nye County, Nevada, since 1983 in support of the US Department of Energy`s Yucca Mountain Project, which is an evaluation of the area to determine its suitability as a potential storage area for high-level nuclear waste. Water-level measurements were taken either manually, using various water-level measuring equipment such as steel tapes, or they were taken continuously, using automated data recorders and pressure transducers. This report presents precision <b>range</b> and <b>accuracy</b> data established for manual water-level measurements taken in the Yucca Mountain area, 1988 - 1990.

5000|$|The Brooks-Iyengar {{algorithm}} or Brooks-Iyengar hybrid algorithm [...] is a distributed algorithm, that improves {{both the}} {{precision and accuracy}} of the interval measurements taken by a distributed sensor network, even {{in the presence of}} faulty sensors. [...] The sensor network does this by exchanging the measured value and accuracy value at every node with every other node. And it computes the <b>accuracy</b> <b>range</b> and a measured value for the whole network from all of the values collected. Even if some of the data from some of the sensors is faulty, the sensor network will not malfunction. The algorithm is fault-tolerant and distributed. It could also be used as a sensor fusion method. The precision and accuracy bound of this algorithm have been proved in 2016.|$|E
50|$|The 1-pounder {{revolving}} Hotchkiss cannon {{had five}} 37 mm barrels, and {{was capable of}} firing 68 rounds per minute with an <b>accuracy</b> <b>range</b> of 2000 yd. Each feed magazine held ten rounds and weighed approximately 18 pounds (8 kg). Besides the field gun version, several other versions of the 37mm Hotchkiss revolving cannon were in existence, notably versions for naval defense against torpedo boats as well as fortress versions firing shrapnel or canister {{for the defense of}} moats. The naval version was adopted by Russia and the United States, amongst others. The field cannon version was accompanied by a horse-drawn ammunition limber, which held 110 rounds plus six loaded magazines, totaling 170 rounds. One example is on display at the Museum of the History of the Brazilian Army at Fort Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1902 the British army {{adopted a}} {{universal}} khaki uniform for home service wear, the Service Dress, after experience with lighter khaki drill in India and South Africa. The traditional scarlet, {{blue and green}} uniforms were however retained for full dress and off duty [...] "walking out dress" [...] wear. Details of these colourful uniforms varied greatly between regiments and branches of the army. The early use of camouflage {{in the form of}} plain khaki reflected the exigencies of colonial war and the freedom allowed, and taken, by many of the officers who fought it. The adoption of khaki for active service resulted from the development of weapons of greater <b>accuracy</b> <b>range</b> combined with smokeless powder during the late 19th century, making low-visibility on the battlefield a matter of priority.|$|E

50|$|The RPK-16 5.45×39mm {{light machine}} gun/squad {{automatic}} weapon is a modernization of the RPK-74 {{and is expected}} to take over its role in the Russian Armed Forces. It is based on the traditional Kalashnikov layout and design, it also has several novel technical and ergonomic features derived from the AK-12 program. It is chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge and uses a Picatinny rail mounted detachable bipod instead of the fixed bipod of the RPK-74. It features the traditional Kalashnikov gas-operated long-stroke piston system, a detachable suppressor, a Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optics/scopes and {{on the bottom of the}} handguard for bipod mounting, an ergonomic pistol grip and a folding buttstock and two main barrel lengths; a 550 mm long barrel (when it is configured/applied for the light machine gun/squad automatic weapon role) and a 370 mm short barrel (when it is configured/applied for the assault weapon role). Its design enables it to have an interchangeable barrel, that can easily be removed. It has a combat weight of 6 kg, a full length of 1076 mm, a firing rate of 700 rounds per minute (RPM), an <b>accuracy</b> <b>range</b> of 800 m and uses a standard 96-round drum magazine.

50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{coaches in}} many {{countries}} began using specially made rowing machines for training and improved power measurement. One original design incorporated a large, heavy, solid iron flywheel with a mechanical friction brake, developed by John Harrison of Leichhardt Rowing Club in Sydney, later to become a {{professor of mechanical engineering}} at the University of New South Wales. Harrison, a dual Australian champion beach sprinter who went on to row in the coxless four at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, had been introduced to rowing after a chance meeting with one of the fathers of modern athletic physiological training and testing, and the coach of the Leichhardt Guinea Pigs, Professor Frank Cotton. Professor Cotton had produced a rudimentary friction-based machine for evaluating potential rowers by exhausting them, without any pretence of accurately measuring power output. Harrison realised the importance of using a small braking area with a non-absorbent braking material, combined with a large flywheel. The advantage of this design (produced by Ted Curtain Engineering, Curtain being a fellow Guinea Pig) was the virtual elimination of factors able to interfere with accurate results—for instance ambient humidity or temperature. The Harrison-Cotton machine represents the very first piece of equipment able to accurately quantify human power output; power calculation within an <b>accuracy</b> <b>range</b> as achieved by his machine of less than 1% remains an impressive result today. The friction brake was adjusted according to a rower's weight to give an accurate appraisal of boat-moving ability (drag on a boat is proportional to weight). Inferior copies of Harrison's machine were produced in several countries utilising a smaller flywheel and leather straps—unfortunately the leather straps were sensitive to humidity, and the relatively large braking area made results far less accurate than Harrison's machine. The weight correction factor tended to make them unpopular among rowers of the time. Harrison, arguably the father of modern athletic power evaluation, died in February 2012.|$|E
