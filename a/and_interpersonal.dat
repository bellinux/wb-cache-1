5|$|Released as the {{follow-up}} to the duo's 1996 album ATLiens, Aquemini expands {{on the previous}} record's outer space-inspired compositions by incorporating live instrumentation. The commercial success of ATLiens allowed for more creative freedom for the group, {{which led to the}} members self-producing the majority of the tracks. The band employed a large number of musicians for the album, who frequently entered and exited the studio throughout the recording process and had a major influence on the writing development of the album's songs. Lyrically, Aquemini explores various themes including human nature, addiction, <b>and</b> <b>interpersonal</b> relationships.|$|E
5|$|Released in November 1991, Loveless was rumoured to {{have cost}} over £250,000 and {{bankrupt}} Creation Records, claims which Shields has denied. Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise although {{the album was}} not a commercial success. It peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart elsewhere internationally. McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon {{after the release of}} Loveless, due to the album's extensive recording period <b>and</b> <b>interpersonal</b> problems with Shields.|$|E
5|$|The band {{wanted to}} expand on the {{commercial}} success of the 1975 album Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour <b>and</b> <b>interpersonal</b> strife among Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences shaped the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded {{using a combination of}} acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.|$|E

5|$|The strip {{centers on}} the mixed {{marriage}} between a rabbit, Kevin and a grey wolf, Kell Dewclaw. In their society, their major difference is their diet: Kevin is a herbivore and Kell is a carnivore. Their family includes three children: Lindesfarne, a hedgehog adopted from Kevin's first marriage; Rudy, a wolf/fox hybrid born during Kell's first marriage; and their only biological child Coney, a carnivorous rabbit. The comic's plot revolves around species-related humor, satire, <b>and</b> <b>interpersonal</b> conflict.|$|E
5|$|Under the magnates {{were the}} barons, who held {{increasingly}} nominal feudal tenures of which an important vestige {{was the right}} to hold baronial courts, which could deal with both matters of land ownership <b>and</b> <b>interpersonal</b> offences, including minor acts of violence. Also important were the local tenants-in-chief, who held legally held their land directly from the king and who by this period were often the major local landholders in an area. In this period, as feudal distinctions declined, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged {{to form a new}} identifiable group, the lairds. This group was roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen. Just as the magnates saw themselves as the king's natural counsellors, so the lairds advised and exerted influence over the dukes and earls. The lairds were often the most important individual in a local community. They ran baronial courts, acted as sheriffs-depute, sat on local assizes and were called in as private arbitrators. In the course of the sixteenth century they would acquire a role in national politics, gaining representation in Parliament and playing {{a major role in the}} Reformation crisis of 1560. As a result of the Reformation and the creation of a Presbyterian Kirk, their position in local society was enhanced. They often gained the new status of elder and greater oversight of the behaviour of the local population through the disciplinary functions of kirk sessions.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social <b>and</b> <b>interpersonal</b> frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|Bullying is {{a problem}} in many schools around the world. It is seen as an {{unwanted}} phenomenon in education and in many contexts the reduction of bullying is a target of national and local education policy. In practice, the extent to which bullying occurs differs widely across classrooms. Part of these differences may be explained by teachers' management of bullying. The goal {{of the present study was}} to combine two perspectives on teacher behavior to identify their impact on pupils' bullying behavior at school, namely teachers' bullying-specific <b>and</b> their general <b>interpersonal</b> behaviors. Data were collected by means of questionnaires from 33 upper-grade primary school teachers and their 784 pupils. Results of multilevel regression analyses showed that teachers' bullying-specific <b>and</b> general <b>interpersonal</b> behaviors independently contributed to pupils' bullying behavior. Lower levels of bullying were established when teachers were less likely to discipline the bully, <b>and</b> showed more <b>interpersonal</b> behaviors with high levels of control and closeness, <b>and</b> less <b>interpersonal</b> behaviors with low levels of control and closeness. These findings suggest that teachers' bullying-specific <b>and</b> general <b>interpersonal</b> behaviors are two different pathw...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{neurotic}} symptoms {{are determined by}} interpersonal characteristics is of central importance for psychoanalytic theory, diagnostics, and treatment. In the present paper, the hypotheses were tested that (1) in general, neurotic symptoms are associated with <b>interpersonal</b> problems <b>and</b> (2) more specific, that a hysterical <b>and</b> an obsessional <b>interpersonal</b> dimension underlie the field of neurotic symptoms and that both dimensions are associated with specific types of neurotic symptoms. In a first study, the hysterical <b>and</b> obsessional <b>interpersonal</b> profiles were mapped by correlating clinicians' ratings on hysteria and obsessional neurosis with the scales of the IIP- 64 interpersonal circumplex {{in a sample of}} neurotic outpatients. Hysteria was associated with nonassertive, overly accommodating, <b>and</b> self-sacrificing <b>interpersonal</b> behavior <b>and</b> obsessional neurosis was associated with vindictive <b>and</b> cold <b>interpersonal</b> behavior. In a second study, associations of these interpersonal profiles with different SCL- 90 -R neurotic symptom clusters were investigated in a second sample of neurotic patients and in student sample. The results showed that both interpersonal profiles were significantly associated {{with a wide range of}} neurotic symptoms. However, the hypothesized differential associations of the hysterical <b>and</b> obsessional <b>interpersonal</b> profile with distinguished types of neurotic symptoms were not observed...|$|R
