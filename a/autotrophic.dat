5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or <b>autotrophic,</b> meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical <b>autotrophic</b> bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are <b>autotrophic,</b> whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{bacterial}} mats of free-living {{bacteria are}} also evident at all hydrocarbon seep sites. These bacteria may {{compete with the}} major fauna for sulfide and methane energy sources and may also contribute substantially to overall production (MacDonald, 1998b). The white, nonpigmented mats {{were found to be}} an <b>autotrophic</b> sulfur bacteria Beggiatoa species, and the orange mats possessed an unidentified nonchemosynthetic metabolism (MacDonald, 1998b).|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 2014, NASA {{reported}} that the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers started searching for evidence of past life, including a biosphere based on <b>autotrophic,</b> chemotrophic, or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) {{that may have been}} habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.|$|E
25|$|Bryophytes {{have life}} cycles that are {{gametophyte}} dominated. The longer lived, more prominent <b>autotrophic</b> plant is the gametophyte. The sporophyte in mosses and liverworts {{consists of an}} unbranched stalk (a seta) bearing a single sporangium or spore-producing capsule. Even when capable of photosynthesis, as in mosses and hornworts, bryophyte sporophytes require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and are dependent on the gametophyte for their supplies of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.|$|E

25|$|The alveolates {{are a major}} clade of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes of both <b>autotrophic</b> and heterotrophic members. The {{most notable}} shared characteristic {{is the presence of}} cortical (outer-region) alveoli (sacs). These are flattened vesicles (sacs) packed into a continuous layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically forming a flexible pellicle (thin skin). In dinoflagellates they often form armor plates. Many members contain a red-algal derived plastid. One notable characteristic of this diverse group is the frequent loss of photosynthesis. However, a majority of these heterotrophs continue to process a non-photosynthetic plastid.|$|E
25|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} microcompartments {{found in}} many <b>autotrophic</b> bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, Knallgasbacteria, Nitroso- and Nitrobacteria. They are proteinaceous structures resembling phage heads in their morphology and contain the enzymes of carbon dioxide fixation in these organisms (especially ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO, and carbonic anhydrase). It is thought that the high local concentration of the enzymes along with the fast conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide by carbonic anhydrase allows faster and more efficient carbon dioxide fixation than possible inside the cytoplasm. Similar structures are known to harbor the coenzyme B12-containing glycerol dehydratase, the key enzyme of glycerol fermentation to 1,3-propanediol, in some Enterobacteriaceae (e. g. Salmonella).|$|E
500|$|Scientists first {{reported}} evidence of microbes in the accretion ice in 1999. Since then, a different {{team led by}} Scott O. Rogers has been identifying a variety of bacteria and fungi from accretion ice (not from the subglacial water layer) collected during U.S. drilling projects in the 1990s. According to him, this indicates that the lake below the ice is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem. [...] Then Scott Rogers published in July 2013 that his team performed nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) sequencing and the results allowed deduction of the metabolic pathways represented in the accretion ice and, by extension, in the lake. The team found 3,507 unique gene sequences, and approximately 94% of the sequences were from bacteria and 6% were from Eukarya. Taxonomic classifications (to genus and/or species) or identification were possible for 1,623 of the sequences. In general, the taxa were similar to organisms previously described from lakes, brackish water, marine environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake sediments, deep-sea sediments, deep-sea thermal vents, animals and plants. Sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation-resistant, <b>autotrophic,</b> and heterotrophic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes.|$|E

2500|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} where {{energy is}} obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. [...] Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also <b>autotrophic.</b> [...] There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).|$|E

(e.g., Webster and Hopkins, 1996; Wrage et al., 2001).|$|E
2500|$|Most {{photosynthetic}} microbes are <b>autotrophic,</b> fixing {{carbon dioxide}} via the Calvin cycle. [...] Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, {{meaning that they}} use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth. [...] Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{increase}} in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, developments that destroy <b>autotrophic</b> processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more <b>autotrophic</b> organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover.|$|E
2500|$|Water, carbon dioxide, {{minerals}} and light are all {{important factors in}} cultivation, and different algae have different requirements. The basic reaction for algae growth in water is carbon dioxide + light energy + water = glucose + oxygen + water. [...] This is called <b>autotrophic</b> growth. [...] It is also possible to grow certain types of algae without light, these types of algae consume sugars (such as glucose). This is called heterotrophic growth.|$|E

2500|$|Many sulfate {{reducers}} are organotrophic, using {{carbon compounds}} such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as electron donors, {{while others are}} lithotrophic, using hydrogen gas (...) as an electron donor. [...] Some unusual <b>autotrophic</b> sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans) can use phosphite (...) as an electron donor whereas others (e.g. Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans, Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes, Desulfocapsa sulfoexigens) are capable of sulfur disproportionation (splitting one compound into two different compounds, in this case an electron donor and an electron acceptor) using elemental sulfur (S0), sulfite (...) , and thiosulfate (...) to produce both hydrogen sulfide (...) and sulfate (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Ferric iron (...) is a {{widespread}} anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for <b>autotrophic</b> and heterotrophic organisms. [...] Electron flow in these organisms is {{similar to those in}} electron transport, ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase. [...] Model organisms include Shewanella putrefaciens and Geobacter metallireducens. [...] Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. G. metallireducens) can use toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated aquifers.|$|E
2500|$|Acetogenesis {{is a type}} of {{microbial}} metabolism that uses hydrogen (...) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide (...) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above). [...] Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens. [...] Carbon dioxide reduction in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway. [...] This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by <b>autotrophic</b> sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. [...] Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.|$|E
2500|$|The group Oomycetes, {{also known}} as water molds, are saprotrophic plant {{pathogens}} like fungi. Until recently they were widely believed to be fungi, but structural and molecular evidence has led to their reclassification as heterokonts, related to <b>autotrophic</b> brown algae and diatoms. [...] Unlike fungi, oomycetes typically possess cell walls of cellulose and glucans rather than chitin, although some genera (such as Achlya and Saprolegnia) do have chitin in their walls. [...] The fraction of cellulose in the walls {{is no more than}} 4 to 20%, far less than the fraction of glucans. [...] Oomycete cell walls also contain the amino acid hydroxyproline, which is not found in fungal cell walls.|$|E
2500|$|Methanothermus, Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta and Methanopyrus. [...] The {{biochemistry}} of methanogenesis {{is unique}} in nature in its use {{of a number of}} unusual cofactors to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. [...] These cofactors are responsible (among other things) {{for the establishment of a}} proton gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis. [...] Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized. [...] Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide (...) to methane (...) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas (...) [...] chemolithoautotrophically. [...] These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms. [...] The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth. [...] This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as interspecies hydrogen transfer. [...] A second group of methanogens use methanol (...) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still <b>autotrophic</b> in using [...] as only carbon source. [...] The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens. [...] Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from acetate (...) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens. [...] All <b>autotrophic</b> methanogens use a variation of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway to fix [...] and obtain cellular carbon.|$|E
2500|$|RuBisCO is {{important}} biologically because it catalyzes the primary chemical reaction by which inorganic carbon enters the organic biosphere. [...] While many <b>autotrophic</b> bacteria and archaea fix carbon via the reductive acetyl CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, or the reverse Krebs cycle, these pathways are relatively smaller contributors to global carbon fixation than that catalyzed by RuBisCO. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, unlike RuBisCO, only temporarily fixes carbon. Reflecting its importance, RuBisCO {{is the most}} abundant protein in leaves, accounting for 50% of soluble leaf protein in [...] plants (20–30% of total leaf nitrogen) and 30% of soluble leaf protein in [...] plants (5–9% of total leaf nitrogen). Given its {{important role in the}} biosphere, the genetic engineering of RuBisCO in crops is of continuing interest (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Methylotrophy {{refers to}} the ability of an {{organism}} to use C1-compounds as energy sources. These compounds include methanol, methyl amines, formaldehyde, and formate. [...] Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria Methylomonas and Methylobacter. [...] Methanotrophs are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use methane (...) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol (...) , formaldehyde (...) , formate (...) , and carbon dioxide [...] initially using the enzyme methane monooxygenase. [...] As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are obligate aerobes. [...] Reducing power in the form of quinones and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation. [...] Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as <b>autotrophic,</b> because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to [...] (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the serine pathway (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) or the ribulose monophosphate pathway (Methylococcus), depending on the species of methylotroph.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrous iron is a soluble form of iron that {{is stable}} at {{extremely}} low pHs or under anaerobic conditions. [...] Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric (...) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble ferric hydroxide (...) [...] [...] There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes. [...] The first are acidophiles, {{such as the}} bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, {{as well as the}} archaeon Ferroplasma. [...] These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in acid mine drainage. [...] The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example Gallionella ferruginea, Leptothrix ochracea, or Mariprofundus ferrooxydans) live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are [...] microaerophiles. [...] The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas, which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for <b>autotrophic</b> carbon dioxide fixation. [...] Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme rusticyanin to facilitate the formation of proton motive force. [...] Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.|$|E
2500|$|A {{food web}} (or food cycle) {{is a natural}} {{interconnection}} [...] of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. [...] Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. [...] A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are <b>autotrophic</b> organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.|$|E

These bacteria {{are responsible}} for nitrogen fixation. The amount of <b>autotrophic</b> bacteria is small compared to heterotrophic bacteria (the opposite of <b>autotrophic</b> bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria acquire energy by consuming plants or other microorganisms), but are very important because almost every plant and organism requires nitrogen in some way.|$|E
