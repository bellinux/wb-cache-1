For multimodal distributions, this means that an EM algorithm may converge to a local maximum of the observed data likelihood function, depending on starting values. A variety of heuristic or metaheuristic approaches exist to escape a local maximum, such as random-restart hill climbing (starting with several different random initial estimates θ(t)), or applying simulated <b>annealing</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} {{a way to}} change nature of phase {{transition}} with <b>annealing</b> <b>methods</b> in mind. <b>Annealing</b> <b>methods</b> are regarded as a general technique to solve optimization problems efficiently. In <b>annealing</b> <b>methods,</b> we introduce a controllable parameter which represents a kind of fluctuation and decrease the parameter gradually. <b>Annealing</b> <b>methods</b> face with a difficulty when a phase transition point exists during the protocol. Then, {{it is important to}} develop a method to avoid the phase transition by introducing a new type of fluctuation. By taking the Potts model for instance, we review a way to change the phase transition nature. Although the method described in this paper does not succeed to avoid the phase transition, we believe that the concept of the method will be useful for optimization problems.
