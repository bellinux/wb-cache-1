5|$|The team's first-choice wicket-keeper {{ahead of}} Ron Saggers, Tallon played {{in four of}} the five Tests, missing the Fourth Test due to injury. Despite being the {{preferred}} gloveman, Tallon conceded byes <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> than Saggers during the tour.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} state governments issued {{requests}} for tender for {{the supply of}} sterile fluids and PD fluids. Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players {{who went on to}} {{represent}} England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full-strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Test matches, and Tallon was selected ahead of Saggers despite conceding byes <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> in the opening tour matches. Saggers looked on as Tallon conceded 26 byes and Australia won by an innings.|$|E

5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims {{to a greater}} emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|Silk weaving is the {{dominant}} industry in Varanasi. Muslims are the influential community in this industry with {{nearly half a million}} of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> than elsewhere in India. The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} {{polyandry}} in the ruff {{is the highest}} known for any avian lekking species and for any shorebird. More than half of female ruffs mate with, and have clutches fertilised by, more than one male, and individual females mate with males of both main behavioural morphs more often than expected by chance. In lekking species, females can choose mates without risking the loss of support from males in nesting and rearing chicks, since the males take no part in raising the brood anyway. In the absence of this cost, if polyandry is advantageous, it {{would be expected to}} occur <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> in lekking than among pair-bonded species.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the army}} was summoned to {{assemble}} at York on 24 June, it did not approach Scotland until mid-August. This {{was due to the}} gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay — the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry was well aware of the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms reived one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and leaders do not apear to have been paid <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate.</b> The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more had had to be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition.|$|E

50|$|The venting of gases {{means that}} the battery is either being {{discharged}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> or recharged <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> than nominal <b>rate.</b> This also means the electrolyte lost during venting must be periodically replaced through routine maintenance.
