5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his match in 1890–91 against Gunsberg, some {{commentators}} showed an understanding of <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> Steinitz's theories. Shortly before the 1894 match with Emanuel Lasker, even the New York Times, which had earlier published attacks on his play and character, paid tribute to his playing record, the importance of his theories, and his sportsmanship in agreeing to the most difficult match of his career despite his previous intention of retiring.|$|E
5|$|Jean Verdi Salomon Razakandrainy {{was born}} on 13 January 1913 in Manankavaly, Madagascar, to an observant Christian family of the noble class. His father, Samuel Salomon, was a medical doctor and {{frequently}} traveled to care for patients. His mother, Raolina, moved to {{the nearby town of}} Antsirabe with young Jean Verdi, who was often ill as a child. There she entrusted his education to her father, a farmer and schoolteacher, who provided his elementary education, taught him Malagasy proverbs and stories, introduced him to Christianity, and taught him to paint and play music. Razakandrainy's grandfather taught him the history of their royal family line and the people of the Anjanapara valley in southern Imerina. This education instilled in the child a traditional love of the land, respect for ancestral traditions <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> the beauty of the Malagasy countryside.|$|E

After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; he had to go through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main attraction to the television project was the ability to work on a show produced by Spelling.

25|$|In post-modern thinking, {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> Rousseau's Letter to M.

Rousseau's letter can help to understand the distinction between lived-in culture and theoretical political order. Rousseau's views on the theatre are also thought to echo current concerns with global entertainment, television and Internet taking over local customs and culture.|$|E

25|$|Devotional Day: A day {{to honor}} the {{importance}} of God. Although DeMolay teaches no religious creed, members are encouraged to attend organized worship.

This day marks the second DeMolay Precept, Reverence for Sacred Things. A DeMolay learns tolerance of others' beliefs <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> their own religious beliefs.

25|$|In the 1930s some {{attempts}} were made to secure business loans for the clearance of the West End and Over-the-Rhine, but all failed {{due to the lack of}} local financing. By the 1950s, the city leaders ruled out slum clearance, believing it too closely resembled the abuses of social engineering committed by the Nazi and Soviet governments against their own people. Instead, with the evolution of civic theories <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> historic architecture, they began to reconsider Over-the-Rhine as a historic area worth preserving.|$|E

He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa.

25|$|The {{traditions and}} {{activities}} {{that take place in}} celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the town of Pátzcuaro on the Lago de Pátzcuaro in Michoacán, the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the godparents set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, pan de muerto, a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect <b>and</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called mariposas (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island {{in the middle of the}} lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.|$|E

Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post wrote that he felt Ellis' portrait of the Founders was largely accurate, but that in his reading of the slavery issue, he was [...] "a trifle guilty of the 'presentism' -- seeing the past through the prism of the present -- that he elsewhere deplores". Reviewing for The Christian Science Monitor, Randy Dotinga wrote that the book's close examination of [...] "dry and tedious" [...] political debates [...] "makes for rough sledding at times", and criticized Ellis' dismissal of academic historians.
