25|$|In 1999, KGO-TV {{agreed to}} pay Granite a {{substantial}} fee to stop channel 11 from running ABC programming once the station's <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> expired. ABC's corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, saw the need to expand KGO-TV's exclusive advertising market share into San Jose for this reason, and it felt that KNTV was taking away from the share.|$|E
25|$|NBC got its {{chance in}} the late 1980s, when Kohlberg Kravis Roberts put CBS {{affiliate}} WTVJ (then on channel 4, now on channel 6) on the market. NBC's then-corporate parent General Electric purchased that station in 1987, but WTVJ's <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> with CBS was not set to expire until December 1988. CBS was willing to let WTVJ out of its contract one year early. However, Ed Ansin {{was not interested in}} letting NBC out of its affiliation agreement with WSVN, which also expired at the same time; Ansin even made an unsuccessful petition to the FCC to stop NBC's purchase of WTVJ. He wanted channel 7 to air NBC's strong fall 1988 lineup, which included the Major League Baseball World Series and the Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|On March 20, 2015, Media General {{announced}} that WISH and WNDY would {{become part of}} the Chicago Cubs and White Sox broadcast television networks and carry many of the games the teams broadcast locally in the Chicago market through ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV, then-fellow CW affiliate WGN-TV and new CW affiliate WPWR-TV (excluding those broadcast by the cable/satellite-only Comcast SportsNet Chicago). WISH carries a Sunday-only schedule of games due to program preemption restrictions within its CW <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract,</b> with WNDY airing the remainder of the weekday game schedule and a few Sunday games. The deal for carriage of the games in Indianapolis was required after Tribune Broadcasting discontinued airing sports events involving Chicago-area teams over its WGN America cable channel at the end of 2014. Both of Chicago's Major League Baseball teams claim Indianapolis as part of their broadcasting territories, sharing the market with the Cincinnati Reds, which have games that originate on Fox Sports Ohio carried by sister network Fox Sports Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Stations which carry a network's {{programming}} by {{method of}} affiliation maintain a contractual agreement, which may allow the network to dictate certain requirements that a station {{must agree to}} {{as part of the}} contract (such as programming clearances, local programming quotas or reverse compensation of a share of a station's retransmission consent revenue to the network). <b>Affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> normally last between three and five years, though contracts have run for as little as one year or as long as ten; in addition, if a company owns two or more stations affiliated with the same network, <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> may have end-of-term dates that are the same or differ among that company's affiliates, depending on when a particular station's affiliation agreement was either previously renewed or originally signed.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the {{agreement}} was signed, the <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> of WDAF-TV and CBS affiliate WJW-TV in Cleveland were up for renewal as they were set to expire on or shortly after September 1, 1994. The timing of New World's purchase of channel 4 and the signing of its affiliation deal with Fox automatically gave NBC only a five-month span until the conclusion of its contract with the station to find another outlet to replace WDAF-TV as its Kansas City affiliate (by comparison, depending on the station, the existing <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> {{of most of the}} other New World stations that were slated to join Fox were not due to expire until as early as December 1994 to as late as September 1996, giving NBC, ABC and CBS more time to find a replacement affiliate). The network entered into negotiations with other area stations in the immediate weeks after the Fox-New World deal was announced, as the projected date of WDAF's switch to Fox was now fast approaching.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, all Sinclair-controlled Fox {{affiliates}} including WTTE {{extended their}} <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> {{until at least}} March 2012. WTTE-DT2 was formerly an affiliate of The Tube, a 24-hour digital music channel. Like other Sinclair-owned stations, this was dropped in January 2007, due to a disagreement between Sinclair and The Tube over E/I programming. The network ceased operations that October {{due to the lack}} of advertising.|$|R
25|$|That same year, the deYoung family, {{owners of}} KRON-TV and the San Francisco Chronicle, {{put all of}} its media {{properties}} up for sale. NBC, which {{had been in the}} midst of renewing its affiliation agreement with KRON-TV, jumped into the bidding as it had sought to purchase channel 4—then the network's largest affiliate by market size—for several years due to its status as one of the network's highest-rated affiliates. NBC was thought to be the favorite to buy KRON-TV, but lost a bidding war for the station to Young Broadcasting in November 1999. NBC responded by threatening to yank its programming from KRON unless Young agreed to run it under the conventions of an NBC-owned outlet, including disallowing the station from preempting NBC programs outside of breaking news coverage. The network also made the unprecedented demand that Young pay NBC $10 million annually to carry the network's programming—a form of reverse compensation. Young refused, and announced that it would end KRON-TV's 52-year relationship with NBC once its <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> ended in December 2001.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{give in to}} NBC's demands, Young {{decided not}} to renew channel 4's <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract,</b> which was set to expire at the {{beginning}} of 2002. San Jose-based KNTV (channel 11)—which joined The WB (in conjunction with that network's existing Bay Area affiliate, then co-owned KBWB channel 20, now KOFY-TV) in 1999, after it agreed to drop its ABC affiliation at the behest of network-owned KGO-TV—later approached NBC with a proposal to pay $37 million annually for the rights to broadcast its programming. The network accepted the deal in February 2000, though as late as 2001, NBC was attempting to purchase KRON from Young. Young's asking price for the station was $735 million, which NBC deemed too high and would not accept. Young's refusal to lower the price led to the deal's collapse. In December 2001, NBC purchased KNTV from Granite Broadcasting for a fraction of KRON's sale price—$230 million—making NBC the only major broadcast network to have switched from one Bay Area station to another. The last NBC program to be broadcast by channel 4 was a repeat episode of Crossing Jordan, at 10:00p.m. on December 31, 2001. KNTV officially joined NBC later that evening at 11:35p.m (the regular broadcast of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno), ending KRON-TV's 52-year affiliation with the network.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing a}} bid to {{purchase}} then-CBS affiliate WTVJ (then on channel 4) from then-owner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., CBS made a half-hearted offer to buy WCIX from Taft in January 1987. Taft declined, but a month later opted to sell all of its independent stations and Fox affiliates, including WCIX, to the TVX Broadcast Group. However, TVX became mired in debt {{as a result of}} the purchase, and began to sell off many of its medium- and small-market stations. Although TVX originally planned to keep WCIX, the company eventually decided that the station would have to be divested. One of the primary factors in the decision to sell was that WCIX was TVX's only VHF station, whereas its sister stations were all broadcasting on the UHF band. KKR sold WTVJ to NBC in September 1987. However, CBS' <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> with WTVJ did not expire until December 31, 1988, as did NBC's contract with WSVN (channel 7), which had served as its Miami affiliate since that station signed on in July 1956. WSVN's owner, Sunbeam Television, was not willing to end channel 7's affiliation with NBC one year early. NBC was thus forced to run WTVJ as a CBS affiliate for over a year—a situation that did not sit well with either NBC or CBS.|$|E
5000|$|Fox's partial equity {{acquisition}} of New World Communications {{also included a}} multi-year agreement, under which it would affiliate most of the television stations {{that the company had}} owned outright or {{was in the process of}} acquiring from Argyle and Great American with the network, once individual <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> with each of the stations' existing network partners expired.

25|$|CBS had a thirteen-month {{leeway to}} find a new Dallas-Fort Worth affiliate, as its {{contract}} with KDFW did not expire until July 1, 1995; the <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> for KTBC and KTVI expired around the same time, giving the networks that were already affiliated with the three former Argyle stations slated to switch to Fox a longer grace period to find new affiliates than CBS, NBC and/or ABC were given in most of the other markets affected by the Fox-New World deal (ABC's <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> with WGHP and WBRC ended even later, respectively expiring in September 1995 and September 1996). CBS first approached longtime NBC affiliate KXAS-TV about negotiating an affiliation deal, ultimately to be turned down by its then-owner LIN Broadcasting; WFAA was eliminated as an option as ABC reached a new long-term agreement with then-owner of the station, Belo, to extend <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> for WFAA and other Belo-owned stations that were affiliated with the network. This left KTVT as CBS's only viable option among the Metroplex's VHF television stations, particularly as it was the only other English language station in the market that had a news department (at the time, KTVT had been producing a prime time newscast, which debuted in 1990). On September 14, 1994, Gaylord Broadcasting reached an agreement to affiliate KTVT with CBS, in exchange for also switching its sister independent station in Tacoma, Washington, KSTW (now a CW owned-and-operated station), to the network (Time Warner would later file an injunction attempting to dissolve a previous agreement with Gaylord to turn KTVT, KSTW and KHTV (now CW affiliate KIAH) in Houston into charter affiliates of The WB at that network's launch in January 1995).|$|R
25|$|Following its {{purchase}} of WJZY in Charlotte, North Carolina in March 2013, Variety reported that Fox Television Stations was pursuing station acquisitions in San Francisco and Seattle as it desired {{to have a}} larger presence in the markets of NFL teams {{that are part of}} the National Football Conference (such as the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks), the conference to which Fox holds broadcast rights. Fox had for many years wanted to have an owned-and-operated station in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has always been one of the ten largest Nielsen television markets. After Fox Television Stations assumed ownership of charter affiliate WTXF-TV in Philadelphia in 1995, KTVU became the largest Fox station by market size not to be owned by the network. Fox's original parent company News Corporation (which spun off the network to 21st Century Fox in July 2013 as part of the company's separation of its entertainment and publishing assets) made several offers to buy KTVU, but Cox turned down each of News Corporation's proposals (Fox had also reportedly considered purchasing KTVU's CBS-affiliated sister station in Seattle, KIRO-TV, which would have displaced that market's charter Fox affiliate, KCPQ; such a purchase never materialized, although Fox did attempt to buy KCPQ outright before renewing its <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> with that station in July 2014, after it was unsuccessful in pressuring Tribune Broadcasting to sell KCPQ by purchasing and proposing to move its programming to Bellingham, Washington-based KBCB).|$|E
2500|$|The split-station {{arrangement}} frustrated NBC to {{the point}} where in early 1957, it threatened to terminate its <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> with WBAP-TV if it did not agree to move its transmitter eastward to provide a signal that covered Dallas and Fort Worth. WFAA's corporate parent A.H. Belo first approached the network with an offer to become the Metroplex's exclusive NBC affiliate. The Roosevelts also submitted an offer to move the network's programming to KFJZ-TV. Neither station won out, as the Carter heirs would reluctantly agree to NBC's demands to retain the affiliation and move the WBAP-TV transmitter to an existing [...] candelabra tower shared by WFAA and KRLD-TV, operating it at a higher effective radiated power strong enough to adequately cover central and eastern Dallas County and adjacent areas that had only rimshot signal coverage of the station. WBAP-TV became the exclusive NBC affiliate for the entire Dallas–Fort Worth market on September 1, 1957, with WFAA remaining an ABC affiliate; Channel 11, meanwhile, continued as an independent station, filling its schedule with syndicated and locally produced programs. During the late 1950s, KFJZ-TV briefly maintained an affiliation with the NTA Film Network.|$|E
2500|$|NBC assumed {{control of}} WTVJ in mid-September 1987. However, both WTVJ's and WSVN's {{respective}} affiliation contracts with CBS and NBC did not expire until December 31, 1988. As a result, NBC faced {{the prospect of}} having to run WTVJ as a CBS affiliate for over a year. This did not sit well with either NBC or CBS, and both approached WSVN's parent Sunbeam Television about ending the station's NBC <b>affiliation</b> <b>contract</b> early. However, Sunbeam balked; its owner, Edmund Ansin, did not want to lose NBC's strong lineup of sports programming that year, including the Major League Baseball World Series and the Summer Olympics. Sunbeam also made an unsuccessful play to take the CBS affiliation. NBC did strip nearly all CBS branding from channel 4, and began airing nearly all NBC programs that were preempted by channel 7. In turn, this resulted in WTVJ preempting some CBS programs, with the affected shows airing instead on WCIX. CBS then formally approached channel 6, {{despite the fact that it}} would have provided a much weaker signal to Fort Lauderdale than that provided by WTVJ or WSVN. WCIX's transmitter was located near Homestead, [...] southwest of downtown Miami, giving Fort Lauderdale only a weaker, [...] "Grade B" [...] signal. Accordingly, West Palm Beach's longtime ABC affiliate, WPEC, was persuaded by CBS to switch to the network in order to ensure full coverage in Fort Lauderdale and northern Broward County. In August 1988, CBS announced that it would purchase WCIX from the TVX Broadcast Group, which itself had purchased the station from Taft in 1987.|$|E
50|$|On August 2, 2017, it was {{reported}} that 21st Century Fox was proposing that Ion contribute its stations into a joint venture with its Fox Television Stations division, to create a larger station group in an effort to counter Sinclair Broadcast Group and their proposed purchase of Tribune Media. The proposal also included the possibility for as many as 26 stations owned by Sinclair or Tribune to be switched to Fox after existing <b>affiliation</b> <b>contracts</b> expire.|$|R
