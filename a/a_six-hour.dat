5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over <b>a</b> <b>six-hour</b> period, causing widespread heavy damage.

The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E

However Universal decided that the budget required would be nearly $40 million and they were only prepared to spend $10 million, so the movie was not made.|$|E
