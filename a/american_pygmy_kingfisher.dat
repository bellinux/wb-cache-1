50|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study published}} in 2006 found that the <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was a sister species to a clade containing the green-and-rufous kingfisher (C. inda) and the green kingfisher (C. americana).|$|E
50|$|These birds take {{crustaceans}} {{and fish}} {{caught by the}} usual kingfisher technique of a dive from a perch or brief hover, although the <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> will hawk at insects in flight.|$|E
50|$|The green-and-rufous {{kingfisher}} {{resembles the}} <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> which shares its range, {{but it is}} much larger than its relative, and four times as heavy. It lacks the white lower belly shown by the smaller species, and has more white spots on the wings.|$|E
50|$|<b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfishers</b> perch {{quietly on}} a low branch close to water before {{plunging}} in head first after small fish or tadpoles. They will also hawk for insects. They are not shy, but easily overlooked as they sit silently amongst riverside branches.|$|R

50|$|The {{subfamily}} includes 35 species {{divided into}} four genera. The African dwarf kingfisher is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Myioceyx, and sometimes with the <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfishers</b> in Ispidina. Molecular analysis suggests that the Madagascan <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is most {{closely related to the}} malachite kingfisher.|$|R
5000|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 under the binomial name Alcedo aenea. The specific name aenea is from the Latin aeneus meaning [...] "of a bronze colour". The current genus Chloroceryle was erected by Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848.|$|E
50|$|The river's {{upper reaches}} form the {{northern}} {{border of the}} Carara Biological Reserve. It is a habitat for American crocodiles, while the marshes located at the river's mouth have many waterfowl and wading birds. Among the many herons and egrets are the boatbill and bare-throated tiger heron, and other birds found here include double-striped thick-knee, mangrove warbler and <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Chloroceryle aenea) is a {{resident}} breeding kingfisher which {{occurs in the}} American tropics from southern Mexico south through Central America to western Ecuador, and then around the northern Andes cordillera in the east to central Bolivia and central Brazil. The species occupies the entire Amazon basin and the Tocantins River drainage adjacent in Pará state Brazil. It also occurs on Trinidad.|$|E

50|$|They {{have the}} typical {{kingfisher}} shape, {{with a short}} tail and long bill. All are plumaged oily green above, and the underpart colour shows an interesting pattern insofar as the smallest and second largest, <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> and green-and-rufous kingfisher, have rufous underparts, whereas the largest and second smallest, Amazon kingfisher and green kingfisher, have white underparts with only the males also having a rufous breast band.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} covered by {{secondary}} growth of seasonal semi-deciduous forest, arboreal/shrub/herbaceous formations in the várzea areas, and areas of riparian palms.Vegetation includes the vulnerable Euterpe edulis (Jussara palmito).Vulnerable, threatened or endangered fauna include horned screamer (Anhima cornuta), wood stork (Mycteria americana), black-collared hawk (Busarellus nigricollis), jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Chloroceryle aenea), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] It has the typical kingfisher shape, {{with a short}} tail and long bill. It is oily green above, with a yellow-orange collar around the neck, rufous underparts and a white belly. The female has a narrow green breast band. Young birds resemble the adults, but have paler rufous underparts, no breast band, and speckled wings and flanks. The nominate southern C. a. aenea has two lines of white spots on the wings, while the northern C. a. stictoptera has three or four lines of spots and a concealed white patch of feathers on the undertail. The two forms intergrade in central Costa Rica.|$|E
5000|$|The African <b>pygmy</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> (Ispidina picta) {{is a small}} insectivorous kingfisher {{found in}} the Afrotropics, mostly in woodland habitats.|$|R
50|$|The Madagascan <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Corythornis madagascariensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Alcedinidae. It is endemic to Madagascar and found in western dry {{deciduous}} forests.|$|R
50|$|The first formal {{description}} of the Madagascan <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Alcedo madagascariensis.|$|R
5000|$|Ispidina is a genus {{of small}} insectivorous African river kingfishers. The genus was {{introduced}} by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. The type species is the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Ispidina picta).|$|R
50|$|These similar small kingfishers can be {{distinguished}} by the blue crown of the African pigmy kingfisher. They have different habit preferences and have mostly non-overlapping ranges. The slightly smaller African dwarf kingfisher occurs in tropical rainforests while the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> occurs in dry grassy woodland.|$|R
5000|$|African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfishers</b> nest in burrows {{that are}} dug by both sexes in sandy soil banks or into a ground termite nest. The burrows are between [...] in length. The clutch is {{four to six}} white eggs. Both parents care for the young. They can have several broods in a year.|$|R
5000|$|The African <b>pygmy</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> is [...] in length. The sexes are alike. It is {{very small}} kingfisher with rufous underparts and a blue back extending down to the tail. The dark blue crown of the adult separates it from the African dwarf kingfisher. The smaller size and violet wash on the ear coverts distinguish it from the similar malachite kingfisher.|$|R
5000|$|The African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is {{distributed}} widely in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, where {{it is a common}} resident and intra-African migrant. It is absent from much of the horn of Africa, and also the drier western regions of Southern Africa. It is found in woodland, savanna and coastal forest, it is not bound to water. It is usually found either singly or in pairs and is secretive and unobtrusive.|$|R
50|$|Rarity {{brings with}} it other costs. Rare and unusual {{features}} are very seldom advantageous. In most instances, they indicate a (non-silent) mutation, which {{is almost certain to}} be deleterious. It therefore behooves sexual creatures to avoid mates sporting rare or unusual features. Sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare or peripheral phenotypic features, thus canalizing the entire external appearance, as illustrated in the accompanying illustration of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> Ispidina picta. This remarkable uniformity of all the adult members of a sexual species has stimulated the proliferation of field guides on birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and many other taxa, in which a species can be described with a single illustration (or two, in the case of sexual dimorphism). Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species (and is illustrated in the photograph of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher),</b> its members will avoid mating with members of other populations that look different from themselves. Thus, the avoidance of mates displaying rare and unusual phenotypic features inevitably leads to reproductive isolation, one of the hallmarks of speciation.|$|R
50|$|The African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher's</b> diet {{consists}} of insects like grasshoppers, praying mantis, worms, crickets, dragonflies, cockroaches and moths. They are also known to take spiders which make out quite {{a large part}} of their diet. They also take geckos and lizards that are easily their length and small frogs and even occasionally small crabs. Pray are hunted from low perches and once caught are either crushed in the beak or are smashed against the perch.|$|R
5000|$|A {{description}} of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> without a scientific name was published in 1780 by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The binomial name Todus pictus was coined by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. [...] The genus Ispidina [...] was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. The specific epithet picta is from the Latin pictus meaning [...] "painted". Some texts refer to this species as Ceyx pictus.|$|R

50|$|Some {{bird species}} {{commonly}} seen are the hook-billed vanga, Madagascar <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> crested coua, white-breasted mesite and Madagascar ibis. Raptors sighted in the reserve include the Madagascar harrier-hawk and the Madagascar scops owl. Other avafauna occurring here include red-capped coua and Coquerel's coua, and the vangas Van Dam's vanga, rufous vanga and sickle-billed vanga. Vangas are significant in Madagascar, as 15 of the 16 vanga species are endemic to Madagascar. The greater vasa parrot and Madagascar green pigeon are also indigenous. An important endangered species, the Madagascar fish eagle, {{has a number}} of breeding pairs located in the Ankarana Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Formerly, {{this species}} {{included}} the Colima pygmy owl, Tamaulipas <b>pygmy</b> owl, Central <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> owl, subtropical pygmy owl, and Baja pygmy owl as subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> shrew (Sorex hoyi) {{is a small}} shrew {{found in}} Northern Alaska, Canada and the {{northern}} United States, south through the Appalachian Mountains. It was first discovered in 1831 by naturalist William Cane in Georgian Bay, Parry Sound.|$|R
50|$|Brush {{structures}} are built entirely from plant parts and {{were used in}} primitive cultures such as Native <b>Americans,</b> <b>pygmy</b> peoples in Africa These are built mostly with branches, twigs and leaves, and bark, similar to a beaver's lodge. These were variously named wikiups, lean-tos, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|The cloud-forest {{pygmy owl}} (Glaucidium nubicola) is a short, muscular, small-sized species of owl found {{throughout}} the Andes of western Colombia and north-western Ecuador, being confined to cloud forests between 900-2000 m a.s.l. Below this altitudinal range the Central <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> owl (Glaucidium griseiceps) occurs; above the Andean pygmy owl (Glaucidium jardinii) occurs.|$|R
50|$|The Central <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> owl {{reaches a}} height of about 14 to 16 cm. The skull and neck are {{brownish}} gray, the feathers of the upper body are brown. The tail has two or three pale transversal bands. The underside is whitish with reddish-brown spots on the chest and reddish brown stripes on the flanks.|$|R
40|$|Mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks {{were studied}} at Kichwa Tembo Camp {{on the edge}} the Masia Mara National Reserve in Kenya between July and September 2004. Observations were made on 29 mixed-species flocks, in which 24 species participated. African Paradise Flycatcher Terpsiphone viridis, Black-backed Puffback Dryoscopus cubla, Grey-backed Cameroptera Camaroptera brachyura, Collard Sunbird Hedydipna collaris and Cabanis’s Greenbul Phyllastrephus cabanisi were the most common participants in mixed-species flocks, as well as among the most frequently encountered bird species overall. The Black-backed Puffback was identified as the nuclear species in flocks due to their abundance and frequency {{with which they were}} followed by other species. Mixed-species flocks represent another niche dimension in this diverse bird community, but few of these species could be described as flock specialists; most of the birds observed in mixed-species flocks in this study were opportunistic attendant species, including the African <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> Ispidina picta, not previously described as joining mixed-species flocks...|$|R
50|$|Sorex hoyi was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Microsorex, which was a subgenus under Sorex until more research had been done. The <b>American</b> <b>pygmy</b> shrew is in the order Soricomorpha and the family Soricidae. Its two closest relatives are the smokey shrew (S. fumes) and the large-toothed shrew (S. macrodon). This genus {{is believed to have}} appeared in the late Miocene.|$|R
