40|$|Electronic {{noses and}} similar sensors show promise for {{detecting}} buried landmines through the explosive trace signals they emit. A key {{step in this}} detection is the sampler or sniffer, which acquires the airborne trace signal and presents it to the detector. Practicality demands no physical contact with the ground. Further, both airborne particulates and molecular traces must be sampled. Given a complicated minefield terrain and microclimate, this becomes a daunting chore. Our prior research on canine olfactory aerodynamics revealed several ways that evolution has dealt with such problems: 1) proximity of the sniffer to the scent source is important, 2) avoid exhaling back into the scent source, 3) use an aerodynamic collar on the sniffer inlet, 4) use auxiliary <b>airjets</b> to stir up surface particles, and 5) manage the “impedance mismatch ” between sniffer and sensor airflows carefully. Unfortunately, even basic data on aerodynamic sniffer performance {{as a function of}} inlet-tube and scent-source diameters, standoff distance, etc., have not been previously obtained. A laboratory-prototype sniffer was thus developed to provide guidance for landmine trace detectors. Initial experiments with this device are the subject of this paper. For example, a spike in the trace signal is observed upon starting the sniffer airflow, apparently due to rapid depletion of the available signalladen air. Further, shielding the sniffer from disruptive ambient airflows arises as a key issue in sampling efficiency...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method is disclosed for fabricating mats of ceramic material comprising preparing a slurry of ceramic particles in a binder/solvent, charging the slurry into a vessel, forcing the slurry from the vessel into spinneret nozzles, discharging the slurry from the nozzles {{into the path}} of <b>airjets</b> to enhance the sinuous character of the slurry exudate and to dry it, collecting the filaments on a moving belt so that the filaments overlap each other thereby forming a mat, curing the binder therein, compressing and sintering the mat to form a sintered mat, and crushing the sintered mat to produce filament shaped fragments. A process is also disclosed for producing a tape of densely packed, bonded ceramic particles comprising forming a slurry of ceramic particles and a binder/solvent, applying the slurry to a rotating internal molding surface, applying a large centrifugal force to the slurry to compress it and force excess binder/solvent from the particles, evaporating solvent and curing the binder thereby forming layers of bonded ceramic particles and cured binder, and separating the binder layer from the layer of particles. Multilayers of ceramic particles are cast in an analogous manner on top of previously formed layers. When all of the desired layers have been cast the tape is fired to produce a sintered tape.

A {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was developed that calculates the airflow and dust particle movement around the machine. To this end, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved around the 3 D geometry of seed drillers to obtain the airflow field {{as a result of}} the <b>airjet(s)</b> emitted from the fan exhaust of the pneumatic machines. In addition, the track of dust particles is calculated from the emission sources on the machine into the surrounding air using a Lagrangian tracking procedure of representative dust particles. In this contribution, the model is used to calculate the dust emission, distribution and deposition around static drillers operated in a closed environment. The pneumatic drills chosen were: an overpressure based pneumatic bulk drilling machine (Kuhn Venta nc 3000) and a vacuum based precision seed drill with and without deflectors (Gaspardo ST Stella 300). The machine and dust characteristics were measured and are presented in separate contributions. The measured properties of the emitted dust particles (particle size distribution, density and shape) and the airflow characteristics from the machine (fan outlet direction, air velocity magnitude at outlet) were used in the CFD model as inputs, while the machine and tractor geometry were obtained from CAD drawings. The CFD model predicted the behavior of the dust particles around the static machines. The dust cloud was calculated for a representative number of 10 000 particles from the measured size distribution. The air velocity magnitude and direction and the particle density, size and shape affected the dust distribution around the different machines.

40|$|Air-assist nozzles mix {{air with}} the spray liquid and help {{transport}} the spray to the target. These nozzles {{make it possible to}} reduce application rate and still be able to provide adequate coverage while minimizing spray drift. Air-assist nozzles are relatively new for agricultural spraying and evaluations to date are limited. The performance of air-assist nozzles (Spraying Systems <b>Airjet)</b> were explored and the nozzles were evaluated in field tests using systemic and contact herbicides. Spray-drift assessments for the <b>Airjet</b> nozzles were also conducted. Application rate varied between 30 l/ha to 200 l/ha for the field tests and the spray-drift assessments. For most of the tests two different pressure settings were used. The overall conclusion for the <b>Airjet</b> nozzles is that the choice of air pressure and liquid pressure are very important in determining an acceptable spray pattern, droplet size spectrum and in minimizing spray-drift. The field studies with systemic and contact herbicides did not result in significant differences among the application rates. A spray volume of 30 l/ha gave poor control in the field studies and in the spray-drift assessments. Control improved dramatically with spray volumes above 50 l/ha. Different size inserts and different air and liquid pressures determine the spray volume. It was observed that different size inserts to the air-assist nozzles should be choosen rather than changing pressures if an entirely different spray volume is desired. Changing pressures affect the droplet size distribution and spray pattern uniformity a great deal. The characteristics of a ULV air-assist sprayer (AAN) were also explored. No field tests were conducted with this sprayer. The AAN-sprayer was not evaluated sufficiently to express extensive conclusions. A major observation was that the AAN-sprayer produces a non uniform droplet size distribution in the spray fan and has a high variation in the spray distribution. These studies indicated that air-assist nozzles have potential for applying pesticides at low spray volumes, provided that the air pressure and liquid pressure are maintained sufficiently low...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model to simulate airflow from air-assisted orchard sprayers through pear canopies was validated for three different sprayers: single-fan (Condor V), two-fan (Duoprop) and four-fan sprayers (<b>AirJet</b> Quart). The first two sprayers are widely used in Belgium and the latter one is a new design. Validation experiments were carried out in an experimental orchard (pcfruit. Velm, Belgium) in spring 2008. Ultrasonic anemometers were {{used to measure the}} time-averaged velocity components at different vertical positions before the tree and after the tree when the sprayers were driven through the orchard. The model was able to predict accurately the peak jet velocity, U-m from all the sprayers considered at all distances from the sprayer centre and vertical positions. More than 95 % of the local relative errors of U-m were below 20 %. Average relative errors, E. and root mean square errors, E-RMS, were all less than 11. 04 % and 1. 68 m s(- 1), respectively. The regions of high- (up to 18. 0 m s(- 1) upstream) and low (down to 2. 8 m s(- 1) downstream) -air velocity zones for all the sprayers were accurately predicted. The simulation results showed that the Condor V sprayer had a highly disturbed vertical jet velocity profile, especially at higher heights. The Duoprop sprayer had high jet velocities at the two-fan positions and lower jet velocity in between the two fans. Within the canopy height the <b>AirJet</b> Quatt sprayer showed a more uniform distribution of air than the other two sprayers except the minor peaks at the fan positions.

The considered setup is an industrial weaving machine a blanc equipped with a centrifugal pendulum prototype. Below a critical speed, the prototype functions as predicted and signicantly improves the machine dynamics: the drive speed uctuation is reduced {{by a factor of}} 2. 5 and the vibration level of the harness frames is halved.

40|$|Our {{aim is to}} {{consolidate}} recent data on relationship between central serotonergic neurotransmission and stress-elicited cardiovascular changes. Activation of central of 5 -HT 1 A receptors attenuates tachycardic and pressor changes elicited by {{a wide range of}} stressors (<b>airjet,</b> restraint, open field, fear conditioning, social defeat), supporting the previous view of these receptors as “sympathoinhibitory”. Their likely location is the medullary raphe. It is still unknown whether 5 -TH 1 A receptors are sympathoinhibitory in physiological condition, as 5 -HT 1 A antagonists do not affect basal or stress-altered cardiovascular parameters. In contrast to the established view that central 5 -HT 2 A receptors are “sympathoexcitatory”, experiments with new selective antagonists indicate that these receptors do not mediate stress-induced pressor and tachycardic responses, and are not involved in cardiovascular control at rest. The exception is control of cutaneous vascular bed, both at rest and during stress, likely at the spinal level. 5 -HT 3 receptors located in the nucleus tractus silitarius (NTS) contribute to stress-induced suppression of the baroreflex. 5 -HT 3 receptors located in sympathetic ganglia possibly {{contribute to the development of}} sustained hypertension in chronically stressed rats...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} tree foliage on sprayer airflow through pear trees in a fruit orchard was studied and {{modelled}} in detail. A new three-dimensional (3 -D) {{computational fluid dynamics}} model that integrates the 3 -D canopy architecture with a local closure model to simulate {{the effect of the}} stem and branches and leaves of trees separately on airflow was developed. The model was validated with field observations made in an experimental orchard (pcfruit, Sint-Truiden, Belgium) in spring and summer 2008 and was used to investigate the airflow from three air-assisted orchard sprayers (Condor V, Duoprop and <b>AirJet</b> quatt). Velocity magnitudes were measured before and behind leafless and fully-leafed pear canopies across the row while the operating sprayers are passing along the row, and were compared with the simulations. The simulation results predicted the measured values well with all the local relative errors within 20 %. The effect of foliar density on airflow from the three air assisted sprayers was manifested by changing the magnitude and direction of the sprayers' air velocity behind the canopy, especially at the denser regions of the canopy and by changing the pattern of velocity decay horizontally along the jet.

40|$|There {{is a close}} {{association}} between the location of angiotensin (Ang) receptors and many important brain nuclei involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. The present review encompasses the physiological role of Ang II in the brainstem, particularly in relation to its influence on baroreflex control {{of the heart and}} kidney. Activation of AT 1 receptors in the brainstem by fourth ventricle (4 V) administration to conscious rabbits or local administration of Ang II into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of anesthetized rabbits acutely increases renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and RSNA baroreflex responses. Administration of the Ang antagonist Sarile into the RVLM of anesthetized rabbits blocked the effects of Ang II on the RSNA baroreflex, indicating that the RVLM is the major site of sympathoexcitatory action of Ang II given into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brainstem. However, in conscious animals, blockade of endogenous Ang receptors in the brainstem by the 4 V AT 1 receptor antagonist losartan resulted in sympathoexcitation, suggesting an overall greater activity of endogenous Ang II within the sympathoinhibitory pathways. However, the RSNA response to <b>airjet</b> stress in conscious rabbits was markedly attenuated. While we found no effect of acute central Ang on heart rate baroreflexes, chronic 4 V infusion inhibited the baroreflex and chronic losartan increased baroreflex gain. Thus, brainstem Ang II acutely alters sympathetic responses to specific afferent inputs thus forming part of a potentially important mechanism for the integration of autonomic response patterns. The sympathoexcitatory AT 1 receptors appear to be activated during stress, surgery and anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a move in the kiwifruit {{industry}} to pollinate by machine, allowing orchardists flexibility in timing, and other advantages. The traditional pollinators, bees, are unreliable and are susceptible to diseases such as the varroa mite. No measurements have been done on the efficiency of single-flower collection of pollen {{and the influence of}} <b>airjet</b> characteristics, to put this activity on a firm quantitative basis. For predictive purposes, a robust model of pollen behaviour around a single Green kiwifruit flower (Actinidia deliciosa) was built in this study by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. The theoretical study first looked at the wind pollination of flower buds at different opening stages. Within the range of draft velocity recorded in the orchards, stigma are predicted to capture more pollen in a wind approaching from the front than from the side and back. Also, the pollen deposition on stigma increases as the bud opens wider and loses its petals. An estimation based on the predicted pollen collection efficiency indicated that wind pollination alone is insufficient to produce a minimum exportable fruit, which is in agreement with the observations reported in the literature. The question whether kiwifruit is a wind-pollinated plant is also discussed. Experimental checks of the modelling were carried out. Visualization of flow paths around a real kiwifruit flower in a wind tunnel compared well with the CFD predictions. The machine pollination employs a jet of air. CFD simulations of pollen-loaded air jets were carried out to study the effect of different jet-nozzle configurations, namely the jet direction onto the flower, nozzle-to-flower distance, diameter of nozzle and initial jet velocity. A frontal spray gives the most efficient pollen delivery to the stigma. Further gain is accomplished by introducing the pollen cloud closer to the flower, from a smaller nozzle and at higher initial jet velocity. These trends, except for that of nozzle size, have been validated experimentally through the pollen spraying of single real kiwifruit flower in the laboratory. Recommended ways of <b>airjet</b> spraying are suggested based on the CFD results. From the stigma collision efficiency, it is more advantageous to apply pollen when most of the flowers have lost their petals. Additional inclusion of an electrostatic influence into the pollen-loaded air jet simulations indicate that corona charging, but not tribo-charging, gives enhanced pollen collection by the stigma. The enhancement depends on the strength of electric field established between the nozzle and the flower. The spraying tests with tribo-charged pollen in laboratory indicated that an improved pollen collection may be possible with a greater charging of pollen. The benefit however was not realized consistently in all experimental conditions. The simulations assumed complete stickiness i. e. complete capture of pollen by the stigma on collision. This study also measured the force necessary to remove pollen in contact with stigma. The stickiness measurements of the stigma of Gold and Green kiwifruit flowers found that both flowers have equally sticky stigma. Stickiness increased with the aging of flowers. A reason is proposed related to the sugar in the exudate film. Overall, the variation of stickiness was statistically insignificant during the day. However, some older stigma were found to be stickier in the afternoon, which is in contrast to the general view that stigma are stickier in the morning. The gain in stickiness by the older stigma supports the recommendations for carrying out machine pollination after the petal fall. The last section of the work was done in an orchard, and studied the characteristics of large jet spraying (without pollen) at the T-bar and pergola trained vines. Recommendations on the designs of jet have been provided...|$|E
40|$|Many modem combat {{aircraft}} have S-bend intake ducts supplying {{air to the}} engine compressor. At high Mach number and/or extreme manoeuvre conditions such ducts can produce excessive flow distortions at the engine face due to flow separating at the first bend of the duct. It has been proposed that vortex generators may be usefully employed in such intake ducts to enhance the homogeneity of the pressure distribution at the engine face, and hence, reduce the unsteady loading on the engine. Both vane and air jets have been tested experimentally as vortex generators and each {{has been found to}} reduce the flow distortion that would otherwise reach the engine face. The objective of this thesis was to construct a local numerical model reflecting the physical geometry and conditions of the fully turbulent flow field in the proximity of a vortex generator array. The location of the array is approximately at the first bend downstream in an S-bend intake duct. In this project, five different model geometries were tested. Two were used for model verification and the remaining three for investigation of the local flow structure {{in the vicinity of the}} vortex generators within the duct. Two of the local duct models neglected any curvature effects (referred to as flat plate models). The third duct model, referred to as a sector model took into account the circular nature of the duct's cross section. The flow is assumed to be incompressible and fully turbulent and was solved using the Finite Volume, Navier-Stokes Code CFX 4 (CFDS, AEA Technology, Harwell) on a non-orthogonal, body-fitted, grid using the k-c turbulence model and standard wall functions. The behaviour of the longitudinal vortices produced by the vanes and airjets is presented in terms of circulation and peak vorticity decay, peak vorticity paths in cross-stream and streamwise direction, cross-stream vorticity profiles, cross-stream shear stress distribution and streamwise and cross-stream velocity profiles. Negligible difference in results was observed for the flat plate models with and without the jet inlet tube; neither did we see significant differences between the flat plate model and the sector model, since the <b>airjet</b> momentum was not drastically altered. Comparing the predicted results provided by vanes and air jets reflected major differences in vortex circulation between the two but the enhancement in transverse skin friction was of similar magnitude. Experiments also showed that both types of vortex generator provided like enhancement of the flow field. The optimum pitch and skew angle configuration for the air jets in terms of maximum enhancement of the flow field was predicted with 30 ° pitch and 75 ° skew angle...|$|E
