5|$|Alonso and Arteta were ambitious <b>and</b> <b>dreamed</b> {{of playing}} {{alongside}} {{each other for}} Real Sociedad when they were older. Though they attended different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend. Their performances {{attracted the attention of}} scouts from top Spanish sides and the young Donostiarras separated ways, ending nine years of friendly rivalry, as Alonso went to Real Sociedad and Arteta moved to Catalan giants Barcelona. Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Alfonso Cuarón had a {{predilection for}} space {{programs}} <b>and</b> <b>dreamed</b> {{of becoming an}} astronaut and would watch live moon landings in television. He was 8 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and was profoundly influenced by Neil Armstrong. At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV {{in order to be}} able to see the moon landing that was in black and white. He watched space films like A Trip to the Moon (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor the laws of physics such as Marooned (1969) and Woman in the Moon (1929).

25|$|When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly {{embraced by}} a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the {{writings}} of Sigmund Freud, particularly by his notion of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes <b>and</b> <b>dreamed</b> images were to become the key techniques {{through the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E
