5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E

The book is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the controversies surrounding the series, while the second half takes a theoretical look at the games absent of the controversy.|$|E
25|$|Once dried, the peats are carted to the croft {{and built}} into a large stack. These often resembled {{the shape of the}} croft house – broad, curved at each end and tapered to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 2 metres high. They varied in length from about 4 to 14 metres. Peat {{stacking}} also follows local customs and a well built peat stack can be a work of art. Peat stacks provide additional shelter to houses. A croft can burn as many as 15,000–18,000 peats in a year.|$|E

After undocking, Wilmore piloted Atlantis to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 450 feet ahead of the station, then, began a flyaround. Once the flyaround was completed, Atlantis performed separation burns to increase the distance between the shuttle and the ISS and left the Space Station complex area at about 10:36 UTC.|$|E

25|$|The Pakistan-India ceasefire line {{runs from}} the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 130 {{kilometers}} northeast of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with United Nations (UNO) assistance {{at the end of}} the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–48. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Afridi tribals which Pakistan had sent to occupy Kashmir and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the Shimla Agreement of July 2, 1972 between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).|$|E
25|$|An unnamed trail, but {{referenced}} {{and marked}} in the DRNA maps, is a trail {{that could be}} termed Trail #11 for referential purposes. It was located midway on Trail #9 (that is, about 0.2 mile west of PR-546) and headed north to Trail #5. It met Trail #9 at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 0.2 mile west of PR-546. This trail was about 0.3 mile long. It served the double purpose of acting as a nature trail {{while at the same}} time it connected Trails 5 and 9, thus making for a shortcut from Trail #5 back to the car parking area via Trail #9. DRNA considers this unnamed trail a part of (an offshoot of) Trail #5.|$|E
25|$|During England's 1964–65 tour of South Africa, Barlow became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} in the third Test at Newlands after he survived a bat-pad chance when England bowler Fred Titmus thought he had had Barlow caught by Peter Parfitt in the gully. It was already an ill-tempered series, and when Barlow went on to complete his hundred it was little recognised by the England players. Instead, when Tony Pithey reached his half-century shortly afterwards, the England players went overboard in their congratulations to him, seemingly to make <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> Barlow's behaviour. The local South African papers attacked England for this, {{and later in the}} same match, English batsman Ken Barrington caused a greater furore when he walked despite not being given out by the same umpire that had not given Barlow out.|$|E

25|$|The 33rd Alabama {{began its}} advance about 10:00am in {{conjunction}} with the nearby 16th Alabama; when the latter regiment hit the ground after the first volley from the Union line, the 33rd continued to advance until they reached a small ravine, where they took cover for nearly an hour from the murderous Federal fire until ordered to move forward again. The two regiments moved to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 275yards from the Union line, when the 33rd was suddenly hit with horrendous artillery and rifle fire from its right flank. Completely bereft of support from either side, the 33rd continued to advance, ultimately doing something no other Confederate regiment in that sector managed to do: it crossed the La Fayette Road, General Bragg's main objective. However, it was forced to retreat almost as soon as it had done so, having lost 16 killed and 133 wounded out of the 219 men who had started the assault.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the command}} of the judge, the handler will stand the dog and leave from heel position. The handler will go a {{distance}} of approximately 6 feet and the judge will perform a cursory exam, touching the head, shoulders and hips, and when completed the judge will instruct the handler to return. The handler {{will return to the}} dog, going around behind it, and return to heel position. A variation on this exercise is used in advanced classes called the stand for examination. At the end of the heeling pattern instead of ordering the team to halt the judge will order the handler to stand their dog. While moving the handler will give the command and the dog must immediately stop while the handler continues moving to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 10 feet away. The judge will then approach and perform a more thorough exam of the dog and at the completion of the exam the dog is instructed to return directly to heel position WITHOUT coming to a front.|$|E
25|$|The first {{skirmish}} between American and Communist forces {{occurred on}} October 6, 1945, along the Tientsin–Peking road, barely {{a week after}} the marines arrived in China. On the day before, a reconnaissance patrol traveling down the road found thirty-six unguarded roadblocks, which made the road impassable to anything larger than a Jeep. Accordingly, a detail of engineers and a platoon of riflemen was sent to clear the road. At <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> twenty-two miles northwest of Tientsin, the engineers were attacked by an estimated forty to fifty Communist soldiers. After a brief firefight, the Americans were forced to retreat with three wounded. On the following day, another detail of engineers was sent out with the same objective as before, but this time they were protected by a company of riflemen, a company of tanks, and carrier-borne aircraft. However, the Chinese did not attack, and the Americans were successful in reopening the road to Peking. A large convoy of ninety-five vehicles and several hundred Americans traversed the road without incident shortly thereafter and met up with the American forces who had reached Peking via railroad. A patrol was also established {{in order to keep the}} Tientsin-Peking road open.|$|E
