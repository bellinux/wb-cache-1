40|$|Purpose: Behcets disease (BD) is a {{vasculitis}} {{of unknown}} origin. In autoimmune and vasculitic disorders {{the risk of}} malignancies has been extensively studied. In BD patients more than hundred cases associated with malignancies have been published. However, the direct relationship with BD has not been proved. We <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> investigate the incidence of malignancies in BD patients Material and Methods: Here in we assessed 105 cases retrospectively between 2005 - 2010 with BD diagnosed according to International Study Criteria (ISG). The patient&# 146;s data were reviewed for development of histopathologically confirmed malignancy Results: One of our 105 patients with BD {{was found to have}} solid tumor in the rate of 0. 9 %. The remaining 104 patients with BD were in follow up without any malignancy in this period. The malignancy that we reported was invasive right breast carcinoma in a 55 -year-old woman with BD.

This patient had a history of 16 years colchicine usage as medication for BD.

40|$|Every year {{a number}} of {{pedestrians}} are struck by trains resulting in death and serious injury. While much {{research has been conducted}} on train-vehicle collisions, very little is currently known about the aetiology of train-pedestrian collisions. To date, scant research has been undertaken to investigate the demographics of rule breakers, the frequency of deliberate violation versus error making and the influence of the classic deterrence approach on subsequent behaviours. Aim This study <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> identify pedestrians’ self-reported reasons for engaging in violations at crossing, the frequency and nature of rule breaking and whether the threat of sanctions influence such events. Method A questionnaire was administered to 511 participants of all ages. Results Analysis revealed that pedestrians (particularly younger groups) were more likely to commit deliberate violations rather than make crossing errors e. g., mistakes. The most frequent reasons given for deliberate violations were participants were running late {{and did not want to}} miss their train or participants believed that the gate was taking too long to open so may be malfunctioning. In regards to classical deterrence, an examination of the perceived threat of being apprehended and fined for a crossing violation revealed participants reported the highest mean scores for swiftness of punishment, which suggests they were generally aware that they would receive an “on the spot” fine. However, the overall mean scores for certainty and severity of sanctions (for violating the rules) indicate that the participants did not perceive the certainty and severity of sanctions as very high. This paper will further discuss the research findings in regards to the development of interventions designed to improve pedestrian crossing safety. ...|$|E

40|$|P 53 {{is a key}} tumor {{suppressor}} and {{transcription factor}} protecting us from cancer. The wild type p 53 protein functions as a regulatory protein, triggering a variety of cellular responses to different signals. Activation of p 53 can lead to cell division arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. More than 60 % of all human cancers contain p 53 mutations. P 53 is also reported in many studies {{to play a role}} in the control of other cellular important activities such as angiogenesis and glycolysis. In this study we <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> identify novel target genes of p 53 by investigating the difference in down-stream gene expression of wt p 53 in a the Saos- 2 cell line which is devoid of p 53 expression, in comparison to mutated form of p 53 that has been reported to be associated with cancer and in relation to the lack of p 53 expression. The aim was also to study protein-protein interactions between p 53 and its protein partners in the different p 53 variants. Two different p 53 mutations (R 249 S and R 273 H), considered as hot mutations, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The GeneSwitch system was used to make stable inducible p 53 cell lines. This expression is controlled by mifepristone (inducer). Total proteins were isolated from the different cell lines and separated on 2 D gels. The total protein expression in Saos- 2 cells containing wild type p 53, R 249 S or R 273 H mutants, in addition to cells with no p 53 copy were compared. The expression patterns of the different samples were similar but not identical. Our results showed a different expression patterns in some vital proteins. Our results suggest a role of p 53 in transcriptionally activating the β subunit of Prolyl 4 -Hydroxylase which plays an important role in angiogenesis. Also our results show different patterns in expressing vimentin, which is the most abundant intermediate filament protein in various cell types, between the different cell lines. Also our results show a clear difference in the protein expression patterns of four proteins, which are essential in glycolysis (TIM, enolase 1, α-enolase and aldolase A.) suggesting a role of p 53 in the metabolism of tumors particularly in glycolysis. Recent studies have implicated some of these proteins in cancer if not to p 53 as well. Studies dealing with P 53 and its partner proteins from the total protein using anti V 5 antibody were attempted, but was not pursued further due to the short time. The way of doing this was proteomics...|$|E
40|$|Session - Upper GI/HepatobilaryBACKGROUND: Trefoil family factors (TFF), a {{group of}} small {{secretory}} peptides, and mucins, the major components of the mucous viscous gel covering the epithelial surface, {{play an important role}} in mucosal defense and healing. H. pylori infection causes gastric mucosal inflammation and injury. This study <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>To</b> determine the expression of TFF 2 and MUC 6 in normal and H. pylori infected gastric epithelium at the gastric antrum, incisura and body, and to explore the association between the aberrant expression of TFF 2 and MUC 6 and antralization in the incisura. METHODS: Gastric biopsy specimens taken from the gastric antrum, incisura and body of 76 patients with dyspeptic and reflux symptoms were examined by immunohistochemistry for TFF 2 and MUC 6 expression in the gastric foveola and deeper glands. H. pylori infection was determined by both a rapid urease test and histology. RESULTS: Of the 76 patients, 27 were positive for H. pylori infection. In the foveola,TFF 2 and MUC 6 expression, were significantly greater in positive patients with infection, than in H. pylori negative patients at the antrum (59. 3 % vs. 4. 1 %, OR = 34. 2, 95 % CI: 6. 83 – 171. 0, c 2 = 29. 30, P < 0. 001, and 63. 0 % vs. 4. 1 %, OR = 40. 0, 95 %CI: 7. 94 – 201. 1, c 2 = 32. 19, P < 0. 001, respectively) and the incisura (44. 4 % vs. 2. 0 % OR = 38. 4, 95 % CI: 4. 61 – 320. 2, c 2 = 19. 19, P < 0. 001 and 48. 1 % vs. 0 %, c 2 = 25. 17, P < 0. 001, respectively). In the deeper glands, TFF 2 and MUC 6 expression was significantly higher in H. pylori infected patients than uninfected patients at the incisura (both 85. 2 % vs. 22. 4 %, OR = 19. 9, 95 % CI: 5. 66 – 69. 8, 27. 71, P < 0. 001, respectively). Antral type mucosa was present at the incisura in 36. 8 %) of patients. The rates of expression of TFF 2 and MUC 6 in the foveola were 39. 3 %, 5. 9 % and 0 %, respectively, in antral type, transitional type and body type mucosa (df = 2, c 2 = 43. 74, P < 0. 001). In the deeper glands, the rates were 92. 9 %, 23. 5 %, and 0 %, respectively (df = 2, c 2 = 15. 62, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection increases the expression of TFF 2 and MUC 6 in the gastric epithelium, which may be a protective response of host to the mucosal damages induced by H. pylori infection. Over-expression of TFF 2 and MUC 6 is associated with antralization of gastric incisura, thus may be involved in and used as a biological marker for the process...|$|E
