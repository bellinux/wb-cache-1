25|$|The Coast {{as it was}} called, also invented its {{own kind}} of dance hall, called a Barbary Coast Dance Hall. It was {{different}} than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies. And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe. Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it {{was referred to as}} the Paris of America. Drug addicts of the district could even buy cocaine or morphine at an all night Grant Street drugstore for only two or three times the price of <b>a</b> <b>beer.</b> <b>And</b> during the 1890s San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.|$|E
500|$|After the {{brothers}} visit Bobby, {{who is in}} an unexplainable coma, they search his motel room and find a newspaper article about a doctor who suffered a sleep-related death. Dean visits the doctor's office, and learns that he was conducting secret dream experiments for his study on sleep disorders. Dean tracks down Jeremy, {{a young man who}} was part of the sleep study because he could not dream. While they talk, Jeremy offers Dean <b>a</b> <b>beer,</b> <b>and</b> he drinks it. Jeremy (G. Michael Gray) reveals that the experiment allowed him to dream by drinking a yellow tea, but the dreams scared him so much that he dropped out of the study. Sam, who has been busy conducting research, later tells Dean that a plant known as [...] "African Dream Root" [...] allegedly allows a person to enter and manipulate others' dreams; they believe someone killed the doctor in this manner and is now targeting Bobby. As a terrified Bobby hides in a closet within his dream, Dean suggests to Sam that they themselves use the dream root to save him.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the game, an old {{video clip}} from Cheryl's {{camcorder}} is played. Four variations of this clip are available depending upon the player's actions as Harry. In [...] "Love Lost", Harry packs his luggage in a car and tells Cheryl not to blame herself for her parents' separation. In [...] "Drunk Dad", a drunken Harry yells at Cheryl, demands <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> blames his drinking on his family. In [...] "Sleaze and Sirens", Harry flirts on his bed with Lisa and Michelle. In [...] "Wicked and Weak", Dahlia verbally abuses Harry and slaps him. In the [...] "UFO" [...] joke ending, Cheryl tells Dr. Kaufmann that she believes Harry was kidnapped by aliens and that Silent Hill is a spaceship. After James Sunderland interrupts, the therapy session continues, revealing Cheryl to be a dog and Dr. Kaufmann to be a grey alien. Regardless of the ending, the final scene shows Cheryl packing away mementos that the player can collect throughout the game. An additional scene the player can obtain shows her reconciling with Dahlia outside the clinic.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} episode, East Dillon wins the state {{championship}} after Coach Taylor and Vince share a moment of respect for each other. Coach Taylor then moves with his wife to Philadelphia as she accepts the job as Dean of Admissions at a prestigious school, and the show ends showing them living happily. Tim and Tyra talk about their dreams and a potential future at his new home site. Julie is engaged to Matt and lives with him in Chicago. Vince is the quarterback of the Dillon Panthers [...] "Superteam", consisting of Both East and West Dillon High School athletes, joined by Buddy Jr., Tinker, and possibly Hastings. Jess is living in Dallas, and helping to student coach a team and is following her dreams. Billy is expecting twins with Mindy. Luke Cafferty is seen with Becky at the bus depot departing for the Army. The second to the last scene is of Tim and Billy, taking a break while putting up the frame of Tim's new house. They sit back, crack open <b>a</b> <b>beer,</b> <b>and</b> Billy toasts, [...] "Texas Forever?" [...] to which Tim responds emphatically, [...] "Texas Forever" [...] and they clink their beers. The series ends with Eric coaching a new high school team in Philadelphia (in a noticeably smaller stadium than those in Texas). After practice, Eric recites the phrase: [...] "Clear eyes, full hearts..." [...] After not getting the normal response of [...] "Can't lose," [...] he says, [...] "We'll deal with that later." [...] Tami then shows up and the two walk off the field as the lights turn off.|$|E
2500|$|Gorton was {{initially}} {{a very popular}} Prime Minister. He carved out a style quite distinct from those of his predecessors – the aloof Menzies and the affable, sporty Holt.

2500|$|The {{business}} thrived, and <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> wine shop (similar to a present-day {{public house}} or wine bar) were added. [...] This {{was called the}} Vintners Arms, but it was usually known as the Thieves Kitchen locally—a humorous reference to its popularity with local tradesmen. [...] In the 1830s, the premises were rebuilt in the Greek Revival style, again using the pale brickwork often seen on old buildings in Worthing: the town had many brickworks in the 19th century, and the local clay yielded creamy-yellow bricks.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{terminology}} {{appears to be}} fluid, relying primarily on rhyming with the intended meaning. One example provided by Daniel William Barrett, in his book, [...] "Life and Work Among The Navvies," [...] contains the following navvy slang; [...] "'now, Jack, I'm goin' to get a tiddley wink of pig's ear; keep your mince pies on the Billy Gorman.'" [...] This means the speaker's going for <b>a</b> <b>beer,</b> <b>and</b> asking the person being addressed, to keep {{his eyes on the}} foreman. Their exclusionary code usually left outsiders confused.|$|E

It is an [...] "Alive-At-Five" [...] style pep-rally with live music, ECU cheerleaders, exhibits, children's activities, food samplings, and <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> wine garden. The Downtown area is known for its large annual Halloween street party and live music bars. Considering the size of the city, Greenville has a large number of bars and nightclubs located downtown, {{due in large part to}} the location of ECU's campus which is immediately adjacent to downtown.|$|E

50|$|In 1855 occupations in {{the village}} {{included}} a farmer, <b>a</b> butcher, <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> retailer, <b>a</b> shopkeeper, <b>and</b> the landlord of the Three Tuns public house. The Three Tuns was listed in 1872 along with <b>a</b> further <b>beer</b> house <b>and</b> <b>a</b> shopkeeper, these also in 1885 {{with the addition of}} a grocer and a shoemaker.

2500|$|Prominent lyrics in {{the song}} include, [...] "I heard you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?"; [...] "Heaven is a place on earth with you/ Tell me {{all the things you}} want to do"; and [...] "open up <b>a</b> <b>beer...</b> <b>and</b> play a video game?" [...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that the inspiration for the song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But I think with that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd go to work and he'd play his video games– but also it was maybe too regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, 2011, during Screeching Weasel's South by Southwest Festival {{performance}} at the Scoot Inn in Austin, Texas, Foster punched {{the face of a}} female audience member who had thrown <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> ice cubes at him, and also spit in his face. As a result a woman on the stage, believed to be the club's owner, grabbed him from behind, and Ben mistaking her for an attacking fan turned around and punched her twice in the scuffle. Foster was then restrained by security and left the venue. On March 22, Foster apologized. On March 23, Punknews.org posted a statement from the four other members of Screeching Weasel, Dan Schafer, Adam Cargin, Justin Perkins and Drew Fredrichsen, announcing their resignation from the band. [...] "The un-calculated act put forth by Ben 'Weasel' Foster leading up to and including the violence that erupted on stage is seen by the band as shameful and embarrassing. The sentiments and actions expressed were completely out of our control and in no way represent the band members' view points or moral compasses. As a result, the band has discussed at length and has {{come to the conclusion that}} as a group we will not likely be able to muster the dignity to attempt a live performance as 'Screeching Weasel' in the foreseeable future." ...|$|E

[...] began Mr. Acton, who, being a conscientious man {{as well as an}} excellent teacher, felt that he was responsible for the children in school hours, and did his best to aid parents in guarding them from the few temptations which beset them in a country town. A certain attractive little shop, where confectionery, baseballs, stationery, and picture papers were sold, was a favorite loafing place for some of the boys till the rule forbidding it was made, because {{in the rear of the}} shop was <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> billiard saloon. A wise rule, for the picture papers were not always of the best sort; cigars were to be had; idle fellows hung about there, and some of the lads, who wanted to be thought manly, ventured to pass the green baize door [...] "just to look on." ...|$|E
