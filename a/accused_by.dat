5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was <b>accused</b> <b>by</b> Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened {{to such an extent that}} various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces.

Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its {{shows such as}} Washington Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words have been <b>accused</b> <b>by</b> some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias.

A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E

Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E

After talk of Ileana marrying the Tsar of Bulgaria or the Prince of Asturias, she was eventually betrothed to Alexander, Count of Hochberg, a minor German prince, in early 1930.
