There exists massive number of spams sent from justifiable home computers that comprises of a malware called as bot. The current scheme to identify mail senders called as Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) which cannot identify such spamming bots. They are capable of only identifying email domains and not email <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>senders.</b> A delicately complex problem when using no DNS is where to locate our trusted core, rather than the DNS. To cope up with this problem, we are proposing a design to detect the email <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>senders</b> that do not use DNS, so we embed our scheme into the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

40|$|The {{management}} of modern distributed systems {{is complicated by}} scale and dynamics. Scalable, decoupled communication establishes flexible, loosely coupled component relationships, and these relationships help meet the present demands on management. However, traditional decoupled addressing mechanisms tend to focus the addressing on {{only one of the}} parties involved in communication while, in general, a communication relationship involves a sender, communicated content, and receivers. The state of all three are simultaneously relevant to correctness of a management relationship and its communications. We introduce Selective Notification, a scalable, decoupled event dissemination architecture supporting simultaneous and combined <b>addressing</b> <b>of</b> <b>senders,</b> receivers, and events.

50|$|An IP {{address is}} {{assigned}} to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains, among other things, the IP <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> <b>of</b> the packet.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 Hotmail {{included}} an X-Originating-IP email header field {{that shows the}} IP <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender.</b> As <b>of</b> December 2012, Hotmail removed this header field, replacing it with X-EIP (meaning encoded IP) with the stated goal of protecting users' privacy.|$|R

25|$|Because the IP <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> and the {{recipient}} are not both in cleartext at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping {{at any point}} along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends.

50|$|Privacy {{concerns}} {{include the}} storing of data regarding payment information, transaction details, payment attempts {{and other information}} stored by Google indefinitely. The privacy policy for Google Wallet, called the Google Payments Privacy Notice, indicates {{that much of the}} data is stored but may not be shared outside Google except under certain circumstances. Information that may be collected upon signing up includes credit or debit card number and expiration date, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, or taxpayer ID number. Information that may be collected about a transaction made through Google Wallet includes date, time, and amount of transaction, merchant’s location and description, a description of goods or services purchased, any photo the user associates with the transaction, the names and email <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>sender</b> and recipient, the type of payment method used, and a description of the reason for the transaction if included.|$|R
5000|$|Sender {{hardware}} address (SHA): Media <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender.</b> In an ARP request this field {{is used to}} indicate the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the host sending the request. In an ARP reply this field is used to indicate the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the host that the request was looking for. (Not necessarily <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the host replying {{as in the case}} of virtual media.) Note that switches do not pay attention to this field, particularly in learning MAC addresses. The ARP PDU is encapsulated in Ethernet frame, and that is what Layer 2 devices examine.|$|R
50|$|Initially, a {{piece of}} mail was {{identified}} by the sending date and the <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> and the recipient; later tracking numbers came {{to be used for}} identification. Traceability has been improved even further by barcoding: by non-specific 1D linear barcodes and 2D matrix barcodes and specialized augmented postal codes such as Postal Alpha Numeric Encoding Technique (PLANET), Postal Numeric Encoding Technique (POSTNET) and Intelligent Mail barcode, and other electronic product codes (EPC-s).|$|R
30|$|RDATA (Relay Data): like a DATA frame, the Address 1 field {{contains}} the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the receiver, the Address 2 field {{contains the}} <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender,</b> and the Address 3 field contains the BSSID. On the first hop, for example, Address 1 holds the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the relay and Address 2 holds the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the AP. Likewise {{on the second}} hop, Address 1 holds the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the relay and Address 2 holds the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the destination node. The Address 4 field, not used in regular DATA frames unless the To DS and From DS bits are both set, is used in RDATA to hold the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the destination node for both hops.|$|R
30|$|To support {{topology}} broadcasts, correct values {{need to be}} used in the Hop Limit {{field in}} combination with a special destination address equal to FF 16 :: 1. The traffic class value is used to signal the IEEE 802.11 p (or ITS-G 5 A) MAC layer which priority to be used. The source of any (geo-)broadcast packet always has to be the global unicast IPv 6 <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender,</b> since multicast addresses may not be used as source addresses[42]. This also allows unicast communication with nodes that were discovered through (geo-)broadcast announcement.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that using}} a {{reserved}} IPv4 address, {{such as those}} provided by , is undefined, since these networks are disallowed from being routed on the public Internet. For example, using 192.168.1.1 as the router's WAN address would be invalid since a return packet {{would not be able}} to determine the destination IPv4 <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the actual <b>sender.</b>|$|R
50|$|The basic {{protocol}} for sending data over the Internet network {{and many other}} computer networks is the Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains, among other things, the IP <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> <b>of</b> the packet. The source IP address is normally the address that the packet was sent from, but the sender's address in the header can be altered, so that to the recipient {{it appears that the}} packet came from another source. The protocol requires the receiving computer to send back a response to the source address, so that spoofing is mainly used when the sender can anticipate the network response or does not care about the response.|$|R
50|$|Mail filters have {{varying degrees}} of configurability. Sometimes they make {{decisions}} based on matching a regular expression. Other times, code may match keywords in the message body, or perhaps the email <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> <b>of</b> the message. More complex control flow and logic is possible with programming languages; this is typically implemented with a data-driven programming language, such as procmail, which specifies conditions to match and actions to take on matching, which may involve further matching. Some more advanced filters, particularly anti-spam filters, use statistical document classification techniques such as the naive Bayes classifier. Image filtering can use complex image-analysis algorithms to detect skin-tones and specific body shapes normally associated with pornographic images.|$|R

50|$|The Address Resolution Protocol uses {{a simple}} message format {{containing}} one address resolution request or response. The {{size of the}} ARP message depends on the upper layer and lower layer address sizes, which are given {{by the type of}} networking protocol (usually IPv4) in use and the type of hardware or virtual link layer that the upper layer protocol is running on. The message header specifies these types, as well as the size <b>of</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request (1) and reply (2). The payload of the packet consists <b>of</b> four <b>addresses,</b> the hardware and protocol <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> and receiver hosts.|$|R
5000|$|When the French {{influence}} {{extended to}} Mohéli, Grande Comore and Anjouan, the Frenchmen must {{have used the}} postal service based in Mayotte. Eagle stamps and French stamps (non perforated in the colonies) were certainly used. But, on the datestamp, it was always written [...] "Mayotte and dependencies" [...] (Mayotte et dépendances). Unless the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> or the letter can give hints, {{it is impossible to}} recognize the real origin of a Comorian letter of that time. Until the 1870s, the postage stamp itself was cancelled with rhombus of points with a hole in the middle {{it is impossible to know}} where an unstuck stamp was used.|$|R
5000|$|WITHWARMING {{means that}} when another {{computer}} takes {{over the role of}} the current one, the marked data (variable) will be copied to the new computer.

50|$|Bitcoin {{transactions}} are all stored, by design, {{in a public}} ledger (the blockchain) that is accessible to everyone. These transactions provide privacy through pseudonymity, in that while each transaction {{is associated with the}} public <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> and receiver, the names of the owners <b>of</b> these <b>addresses</b> are at no time made known to the bitcoin network. To increase privacy, each person could create as many public addresses as they like, making it difficult to link transactions to the same person. If additional privacy were required, it is possible to launder bitcoin through a trusted third party, where the input coins are mixed in a large pool and output to a new address.|$|R

We don't send letters to the Returned Letter Branch till we've tried, as you see, to get the correct addresses, and until two {{separate}} letter-carriers have attempted to deliver them. After leaving the letter-carriers' hands, the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> every undelivered letter, and the indorsement it bears, are carefully examined by a superior officer, who is held responsible for discovering any wrong treatment it may have undergone, and for having recourse to any further available means of finding the owner. It is considered better that the <b>sender</b> <b>of</b> a letter should know as soon as possible of its non-delivery, than that it should travel about with little prospect of its owner being found. We therefore send it to the Returned Branch without further delay, where it is carefully examined by a superior officer, to see that it has actually been presented as addressed, and that the reasons assigned for its non-delivery are sufficient. In doubtful cases the Directories and other books of reference in the branch are consulted, and should it be found that there has been any oversight or neglect, the letter is immediately re-issued. After all has been done that can be to deliver such letters, they are opened, and returned the same day to the senders. If valuables are enclosed, the address and contents are recorded in case <b>of</b> inquiry. When <b>senders</b> fail to give their addresses, sometimes these are discovered by bills of exchange, cheques, or money-orders, which happen to be enclosed.

25|$|Modern alternatives, {{such as the}} telegraph, telephone, telex, facsimile, and email, {{have reduced}} the {{attractiveness}} of paper mail for many applications. These modern alternatives have some advantages: {{in addition to their}} speed, they may be more secure, e.g., because the general public can not learn the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> or recipient from the envelope, and occasionally traditional items of mail may fail to arrive, e.g. due to vandalism to mailboxes, unfriendly pets, and adverse weather conditions. Mail carriers due to perceived hazards or inconveniences, may refuse, officially or otherwise, to deliver mail to a particular address (for instance, if there is no clear path to the door or mailbox). On the other hand, traditional mail avoids the possibility of computer malfunctions and malware, and the recipient does not need to print it out if they wish to have a paper copy, though scanning is required to make a digital copy.|$|R
50|$|Desktop {{organizer}} {{software applications}} are applications that automatically create useful organizational structures from desktop content from heterogeneous types of content including email, files, contacts, companies, RSS news feeds, photos, music and chat sessions. The organization {{is based on}} a combination of automated scanning of metadata similar to data mining and manual tagging of content. The metadata stored in applications is correlated based on a structure for the data type handled by the organizer tool. For example, the email <b>address</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sender</b> <b>of</b> an email allows the email to be filed in a virtual folder for the author and company the author works for or a music file is filed by the musician and album label. The resulting visualization simplifies use of desktop content to navigate, search, and use related information stored on the desktop computer. The data in desktop organizer tools is normally stored in a database rather than the computer's file system in order to produce virtual folders where the same item can appear in multiple folders to the user based on its relationship to the folder.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we learn}} {{in more detail}} about the {{functioning}} of the e-mail system, the role of the DNS, and the vulnerability of the SMTP. In order for the service to run smoothly, a suitable protection of the mail server is significant. Server certificates and SSL play a central role here. An additional way is achieved by e-mail authentication. To this purpose, we presented a variety of authentication mechanisms, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. SPF checks the IP <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> and determines whether he or she is authorized to send e-mails with that identity. DKIM adds a digital signature to the sent e-mail and secures the content of the message. DMARC mechanism is {{based on the results of}} the two aforementioned authentication mechanisms. It specifies the rules for the destination server of the received message, dictating what action it should perform on it. We carried out the implementation of these mechanisms and tested their performance...|$|R
40|$|In April 1913 {{a letter}} {{arrived at the}} Main Post Office in Vienna's Fleischmarkt {{addressed}} poste-restante to a Mr Nikon Nizetas. It was postmarked Eydtkunen, a German provincial town near the Russian border. After remaining for the maximum period allowed, it was returned to Eydtkunen and thence to Berlin {{to be returned to}} the sender. When it was opened, however, it aroused suspicion: it contained no less than 6, 000 Austrian Kronen (today worth about £ 8, 000) and the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sender</b> was in Geneva. The letter was therefore passed on to German intelligence who traced the address to a retired French officer who was active in espionage. The Austrians too, were immediately informed and the man who took charge of investigations in Vienna was the head of military counter-intelligence there, Major Max Ronge. He had occupied the post for almost a year, having taken over from Colonel Alfred Redl, who had been temporarily reassigned to active duties as Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army Corps in Prague...|$|R
40|$|Information about online {{presence}} allows {{participants of}} instant messaging (IM) systems {{to determine whether}} their prospective communication partners {{will be able to}} answer their requests in a timely manner, or not. That is why presence information, combined with the ability to send instant messages, makes IM more personal and closer than other forms of communication such as e-mail. On the other hand, revelation of presence constitutes a potential of misuse by untrustworthy entities. A possible risk is the generation of online logs disclosing user habits. This makes presence information a resource worth protecting. We argue, however, that current IM systems do not take reasonable precautions to protect presence information. We implemented an IM system designed to be robust against attacks to disclose a user’s presence. In contrast to existing systems, it stores presence information in a registry {{in a way that is}} only detectable and applicable for intended users and not comprehensible even for the registry itself. We use a distributed hash table (DHT) as registry and apply an anonymous communication network to protect the physical <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> both <b>senders</b> and receivers <b>of</b> messages...|$|R
