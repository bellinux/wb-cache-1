40|$|Air {{conditioner}} rebate programs aim {{to replace}} low efficiency <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> purchases with high-efficiency purchases. When participants change from {{other forms of}} mechanical cooling (or no cooling at all) to central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> {{the hope is that}} they would have adopted central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> anyway. The implicit assumption is that people prefer central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> to other forms of cooling. We analyze a 1990 ’s efficient central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> rebate program using econometric methods to distinguish between those participants who would have adopted central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{in the absence of the}} program and those who adopted it due to the rebate program. We find that about 5 % of participants adopted central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> because of the program – increasing their energy use. These results raise questions about program effects: Is this increase in central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> purely a subsidy effect, or does the program reinforce the growing social norm that <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> is a necessity? Could it give “good citizens ” permission to buy central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> because the subsidized models are “efficient”?
