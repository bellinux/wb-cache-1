5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since time immemorial and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E
5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. The letters were written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that the writer may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress. It is clear that the author had an intimate understanding of the many personalities within the royal family, likely making him or her either <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> courtier.|$|E
5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.|$|E
50|$|In Tonga, {{horsemeat}} or lo'i ho'osi is {{much more}} than just a delicacy; the consumption of horsemeat is generally only reserved for special occasions. These special occasions may include the death of <b>an</b> important <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> community <b>member</b> <b>or</b> as a form of celebration during the birthday of <b>an</b> important <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> perhaps the visitation of someone important, such as the King of Tonga.|$|R

25|$|DSM-IV-TR defines trauma {{as direct}} {{personal}} experience {{of an event}} that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, injury experienced by <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> close associate, or a state of awareness of something that you usually don't think about, but occurs and leaves you distressed and concerned. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the in vivo environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Through their friendship, Burke {{discovered}} that Crabbe was {{more suited to}} be a clergyman than a surgeon. Crabbe had a good knowledge of Latin and an evident natural piety, and was well read in the scriptures. He was ordained to the curacy of his native town on 21 December 1781 through Burke's recommendation. He returned to live in Aldeburgh with his sister and father, his mother having died in his absence. Crabbe {{was surprised to find}} that he was poorly treated by his fellow townsmen, who resented his rise in social class. With Burke's help, Crabbe was able to leave Aldeburgh to become chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. This was an unusual move on Burke's part, as this kind of preferment would usually have been given to <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> personal friend of the Duke or through political interest.|$|E
500|$|According to the Houston Chronicle, [...] "perhaps the best, most {{meaningful}} Aggie tradition {{of all is}} one you wish never happened." [...] While students at many schools prize their individuality, [...] "Aggies are all about unity and loyalty. [...] When an Aggie falls, the family comes together to remember." [...] This remembrance occurs annually on April 21 as Aggies observe Muster, a solemn event to honor current students and alumni who died during the previous year. [...] Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at Reed Arena on the Texas A University campus. [...] All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent. [...] As {{the names of the}} deceased Aggies are called, <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> friend answers [...] "Here," [...] and lights a candle, to symbolize that although their loved one is not present in body, his or her spirit will shine forever.|$|E
500|$|After {{suffering}} from diabetes for several years, Barrett died {{at home in}} Cambridge on 7 July 2006, aged 60. The {{cause of death was}} pancreatic cancer. The occupation on his death certificate was [...] "retired musician". He was cremated, with his ashes given to <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> friend. In 2006, his home in St. Margaret's Square, Cambridge, was put on the market and reportedly attracted considerable interest. After over 100 showings, many to fans, it was sold to a French couple who bought it simply because they liked it; reportedly they knew nothing about Barrett. On 28 November 2006, Barrett's other possessions were sold at an auction at Cheffins auction house in Cambridge, raising £120,000 for charity. Items sold included paintings, scrapbooks and everyday items that Barrett had decorated. NME produced a tribute issue to Barrett a week later with a photo of him on the cover. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Barrett's sister revealed that he had written a book: ...|$|E

30|$|This {{exploratory}} study provides a {{first look at}} the reasons why family and friends choose web-based counselling over telephone or face-to-face services, and why they would recommend it to someone else experiencing concerns about <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member’s</b> <b>or</b> friend’s problem gambling. As expected, themes around ease of access and privacy and anonymity emerged as well as characteristics inherent in the therapeutic medium. Similar to previous research involving gamblers seeking help online (Rodda et al. 2013), we also found web-based counselling provided a pathway into services and that the intervention provided was viewed as helpful and a reason for recommendation.|$|R

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song refer to a spirit that haunts {{the memory of a}} grieving loved one. Similar to several other songs written by Moody, the lyrics {{of the song}} are based on a short story he had {{previously}} written. According to Lee, it was [...] "Ben 's song." [...] Moody said that the song talks about [...] "a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone." [...] He also stated in the booklet of Fallen that he dedicated the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. In [...] "My Immortal", Lee expresses her feelings through the line, [...] "Though you're still with me / I've been alone all along." [...] A writer for IGN said that [...] "'My Immortal' is a song of pain and despair caused by the loss of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> very close friend and how it drove her [...] to the edge of insanity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{domestic}} violence (DV) was mostly associated with physical violence. Terms such as wife abuse, wife beating, and wife battering were used, but have declined in popularity due to efforts to include unmarried partners, abuse other than physical, female perpetrators, and same-sex relationships. Domestic violence is now commonly defined broadly to include [...] "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence" [...] {{that may be}} committed by <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> intimate partner.|$|E
50|$|A {{third party}} to a {{relationship}} can make an application of disclosure, {{similar to that of}} a person at risk application.

2500|$|There are differing {{views about}} how {{important}} it is to have <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> relative who also attended a college. It is clear that it is a factor; one report suggested that having a family member who is an alumnus gives [...] "a leg up" [...] for applicants. One report suggested that siblings do not count as legacies. In some cases, a parent's attendance at a related graduate school counts as a legacy, but most colleges do not count this. Many selective private colleges have a higher admit rate for alumni children as a way to [...] "keep the larger set of alumni happy and giving", and being a legacy applicant can mean as much as [...] "100 or 200 points on the SAT".|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} reasons for the {{practice}} of ritual servitude. [...] Most common is the concept of atonement. [...] A girl is given to the shrine or to the gods as a kind of [...] "living sacrifice" [...] to atone for the real or alleged crimes of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> ancestor, as discerned by the priest of the shrine. [...] During a process of divination he calls on the gods of the shrine to reveal this information. [...] Girls given to atone for such crimes in a sense are considered a kind of savior, {{for as long as she}} remains in the shrine or under its control, the anger of the god is believed to be averted from the rest of the family.|$|E
2500|$|SMART Family & Friends is {{an online}} or {{face-to-face}} {{support group for}} Concerned Significant Others (CSOs) of people struggling with addictions. The group was started in September 2010. Its purpose is to address specific issues encountered when <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> friend tries {{to reach out and}} help a loved one [...] and it draws from the work of Robert Meyers' CRAFT Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training program, which differs significantly from Al-Anon in that it is a behavioral program which advocates that the CSO can {{have a positive impact on}} the substance abuser. The CRAFT program has been demonstrated in Meyers' research to be more effective than the Vernon Johnson type intervention or Al-Anon, with less negative side-effects and better outcomes, whether or not the substance abuser enters treatment.|$|E
50|$|Canadian {{immigration}} policy allows several classes {{of people to}} enter. The Family Class allows permanent residents or citizens to sponsor <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member's</b> <b>or</b> spouse's entrance into the country. In {{the case of a}} same sex couple, if they are immigrating from a country where they cannot marry, proof of a long-term relationship is required. The Economic Class provides admission to applicants (and their immediate families) who are supposed to be likely to find employment and contribute to the Canadian economy. This is determined by ranking candidates against one another, and the weighing of factors such as education, language skills, and work experience. Some 60,000 come to Canada each year under the International Experience Canada initiative, which provides Working Holiday, internship, and study visas.|$|R

2500|$|According to C.E. Dettmeijer-Vermeulen, Dutch {{national}} spokeswoman {{on human}} traffic and sexual violence against children, in the Netherlands, 3% of the convicted perpetrators are women, 14.58% {{of the victims}} are boys and [...] "most victims were abused by <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> friend <b>or</b> acquaintance." [...] One in six perpetrators is himself underage.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second group}} of {{theories}} is that a family member was involved in her death. Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon John and Patsy Ramsey. According to Gregg McCrary, a retired profiler with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, [...] "statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it's <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> a care giver" [...] who {{is involved in the}} death of a child. From the police's perspective, they did not see evidence of a forced entry, saw evidence of staging, such as the ransom note, and did not find the Ramseys cooperative in helping them solve the death of their daughter. The Ramseys had stated that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to Daily Camera.|$|E
2500|$|By {{keeping the}} patient active, {{focusing}} on their positive abilities, and avoiding stress, these tasks {{can easily be}} accomplished. [...] Routines for bathing and dressing must be organized in a way so that the patient still feels a sense of independence. [...] Simple approaches such as finding clothes with large buttons, elastic waist bands, or Velcro straps can ease the struggles of getting dressed in the morning. [...] Further, finances must be managed. [...] Changing passwords to prevent over-use and involving a trusted family member or friend in managing accounts can prevent financial issues. [...] When household chores begin to pile up, find ways to break down large tasks into small, manageable steps that can be rewarded. [...] Finally, talking with and visiting <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>or</b> friend with memory issues is very important. [...] Using a respectful and simple approach, talking one-on-one can ease the pain of social isolation and bring much mental stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|Wilby {{identified}} many {{similarities between}} the familiars recorded as serving cunning folk and those serving witches, with a general, though by no means universal, attribution of cunning folk's familiars with being benevolent and helping people, whilst those belonging to witches were more often thought of as being malevolent and causing harm. Again, in general the former were {{often referred to as}} [...] "fairies" [...] and the latter as [...] "demons". Wilby noted how both British cunning folk and witches often described similar scenarios for how they had first encountered their familiar: most prominent of these was the claim that the familiar had simply appeared spontaneously whilst they went about their everyday activities, whilst other claims held that the witch or cunning person had inherited it from another magical practitioner, who was usually <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> <b>or</b> that they had been given it by a more powerful spirit. The magical practitioner and the familiar then set about on a working relationship, sometimes solidified in a pact.|$|E
50|$|Each {{programme}} is {{run in a}} group setting, {{consisting of}} not more than 10 people newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (normally within the last 12 months), accompanied, if they so choose, by <b>a</b> partner, <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> <b>or</b> friend. The programme may be run as a one day, or two part (2 x half-day) course.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{tradition}} {{practiced by}} some, {{is to leave}} one extra place-setting for an [...] "unexpected guest". This is to celebrate the tradition of hospitality and inclusion. The empty seat is left open just in case <b>a</b> traveler, <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> friend knocks on the door, {{so there would be}} a place for them to join in the celebrations.|$|R
50|$|Restricted {{foster homes}} {{refer to a}} child being placed {{in a foster home}} with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> neighbour, <b>or</b> close <b>family</b> friend instead of a {{standard}} foster home placement.
