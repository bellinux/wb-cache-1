5|$|Of {{the many}} medical imaging {{techniques}} available, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{appears to be}} superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia, {{and this has been}} shown to give a greater level of accuracy compared with mental testing and medical history analysis. <b>Advances</b> <b>have</b> led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.

Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E

These <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} culinary and medical <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> been {{developed}} in Oldham. There are claims that Oldham was {{the birthplace of the}} first chip shop. The sometimes disputed claim of trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes {{is said to have been}} started around 1858–60 from an outlet owned by a John Lees, on what is the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market. In 1900 Oldham had the highest concentration of chip shops in the country, one for every 400 people. Rag Pudding is a savoury dish said to be native to Oldham. Yates Wine Lodge was founded in Oldham by Peter and Simon Yates in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 {{geologist}} Thomas Jaggar {{founded the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility {{was taken over}} in 1919 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The next century {{was a period of}} thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E

5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> shown that the former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem {{to play an important}} role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> slowed.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent <b>advances</b> <b>have</b> striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
