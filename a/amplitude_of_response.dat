In this study, superconducting YBCO thin films grown on MgO, LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 substrates were first characterized structurally via x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. They then were patterned into bolometers and their electrical and bolometric characterizations were carried out. The {{results of these}} characterizations were fitted to the RC model. In addition, figures of merit for these devices, such as noise equivalent power (NEP) and detectivity, were measured and calculated. During this work, the patterning process {{was carried out by}} standard photolithographic processes and chemical etching. We have also investigated the effect of dimensions of our devices on the performance of bolometers.

Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P 50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, {{to assess the impact of}} maternal anxiety and antidepressant use. METHOD: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P 50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD= 38). RESULTS: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P 50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> to both the first and second stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects...|$|E
