This measurement provided the probability of production of anti-helium through nuclear interactions, thereby providing the predominant baseline for measurements carried out in space. As the physics analysis leader led a team that discovered the heaviest strange anti-matter nuclei. Normal nuclei are formed only of protons and neutrons. Hyper-nuclei {{are made up of}} proton, neutron and a hyperon. The anti-hypertrion, nuclei consists of anti-proton, <b>anti-neutron</b> and anti-lambda (a strange hadron). It has implications for neutron stars and also understanding of the nuclear force. To study nuclei, scientists arrange the various nuclides into a two-dimensional table of nuclides. On one axis is the number of neutrons N, and on the other is the number of protons Z. Because of the discovery of antihyperon it introduces a third axis (strangeness) and the table has become three-dimensional.|$|E

40|$|UHE neutrinos may {{transfer}} highest cosmic-rays energies overcoming 2. 75 K^∘ BBR and radio-waves opacities (the GZK cut off) {{from most}} distant AGN sources {{at the age}} of the Universe. These UHE ν might scatter onto those (light and cosmological) relic neutrinos clustered around our galactic halo or nearby neutrino hot dark halo clustered around the AGN blazar and its jets. The branched chain reactions from a primordial nucleon (via photo production of pions and decay to UHE neutrinos) toward the consequent beam dump scattering on galactic relic neutrinos is at least three order of magnitude more efficient than any known neutrino interactions with Earth atmosphere or direct nucleon propagation. Therefore the rarest cosmic rays (as the 320 EeV event) might be originated at far (>̃ 100 Mpc) distances (as Seyfert galaxy MCG 8 - 11 - 11); its corresponding UHE radiation power is in agreement with the observed one in MeV gamma energies. The final chain products observed on Earth by the Fly's Eye and AGASA detectors might be mainly neutron and <b>anti-neutrons</b> and delayed, protons and anti-protons at symmetric off-axis angles.

40|$|Galactic Dark Matter (DM) annihilations {{can produce}} cosmic-ray anti-nuclei via the nuclear {{coalescence}} of the anti-protons and <b>anti-neutrons</b> originated {{directly from the}} annihilation process. Since anti-deuterons {{have been shown to}} offer a distinctive DM signal, with potentially good prospects for detection in large portions of the DM-particle parameter space, we explore here the production of heavier anti-nuclei, specifically anti-helium. Even more than for anti-deuterons, the DM-produced anti-He flux can be mostly prominent over the astrophysical anti-He background at low kinetic energies, typically below 3 - 5 GeV/n. However, the larger number of anti-nucleons involved in the formation process makes the anti-He flux extremely small. We therefore explore, for a few DM benchmark cases, whether the yield is sufficient to allow for anti-He detection in current-generation experiments, such as Ams- 02. We account for the uncertainties due to the propagation in the Galaxy and to the uncertain details of the coalescence process, and we consider the constraints already imposed by anti-proton searches. We find that only for very optimistic configurations might it be possible to achieve detection with current generation detectors. We estimate that, in more realistic configurations, an increase in experimental sensitivity at low kinetic energies of about a factor of 500 - 1000 would allow to start probing DM through the rare cosmic anti-He production...|$|R

The forging process takes important role in manufacturing to refine the grain size and improve the material properties.

To fix the condition which may causes the coarsening of the steel, hot upsetting experiments in the industrial production environment were performed under different working conditions and the corresponding grain sizes were measured and analysed. The observation showed that the grain will abnormally grow if the deformation is less than a critical value. The strain energy takes a critical role in the grain evolution.

In this thesis, a limit on the neutron <b>anti-neutron</b> (nnbar) baryon violating process (∆(B −L) = 2) is given {{for part of the}} data of the SNO experiment; data is sampled from the three phases of the SNO experiment to construct a three-phase blind analysis. The profile likelihood method is used to evaluate a lower limit on the three-phase open data set of SNO giving a oscillation lifetime for a neutron bound in deuteron of Tnucl> 1. 09 × 10 31 sec (bounded) and Tnucl> 3. 01 × 1031 sec (unbounded) at 90 % CL for 326. 4 days of detector live time.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{case for}} a Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory [DUSEL] located at the Homestake mine in Lead, South Dakota is exceptional. The site of this future laboratory already claims a discovery {{for the detection of}} solar neutrinos, leading to a Nobel Prize for Ray Davis. Moreover this work provided the first step to our present understanding of solar neutrino oscillations and a chink in the armor of the Standard Model of particle physics. We now know, from several experiments located in deep underground experimental laboratories around the world, that neutrinos have mass and even more importantly this mass appears to fit into the framework of theories which unify all the known forces of nature, i. e. the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational. Similarly, DUSEL can forge forward in the discovery of new realms of nature, housing six fundamental experiments that will test the frontiers of our knowledge: (1) Searching for nucleon decay (the decay of protons and neutrons predicted by grand unified theories of nature); (2) Searching for neutrino oscillations and CP violation by detecting neutrinos produced at a neutrino source (possibly located at Brookhaven National Laboratory and/or Fermi National Laboratory); (3) Searching for astrophysical neutrinos originating from the sun, from cosmic rays hitting the upper atmosphere or from other astrophysical sources, such a supernovae; (4) Searching for dark matter particles (the type of matter which does not interact electromagnetically, yet provides 24 % of the mass of the Universe); (5) Looking for the rare process known as neutrino-less double beta decay which is predicted by most theories of neutrino mass and allows two neutrons in a nucleus to spontaneously change into two protons and two electrons; and (6) Searching for the rare process of neutron- <b>anti-neutron</b> oscillations, which would establish violation of baryon number symmetry.

40|$|A {{search for}} neutron antineutron {{oscillations}} followed by n¯N annihilation {{has been conducted}} using the 5. 56 fiducial kiloton-year exposure of the 963 metric ton Soudan 2 iron tracking calorimeter. Based upon realistic simulations of n¯N annihilation and of background neutrino processes, event selection criteria are specified. Candidate n¯N occurrences are required to have prong multiplicity ≥ 4 prongs and to have kinematics compatible with approximately stationary annihilation of two nucleon masses. Events having proton tracks or tracks which {{are likely to be}} muons are removed from consideration. We observe five candidate events; we estimate backgrounds to contribute 4. 5 ± 2. 2 events. We use these observations to set a new lifetime lower limit for neutron to <b>anti-neutron</b> oscillation to occur within iron nuclei. At 90 % CL we find T A (Fe) > 7. 2 × 10 31 yr. Assuming that the nuclear suppression factor for iron has the value calculated by Dover et al, namely T R = 1. 4 × 10 23 s − 1, we determine the corresponding limit for n to n¯ oscillation of free neutrons to be τ nn¯ > 1. 3 × 10 8 sec. These lifetime lower limits are as stringent as any experimental limits which have been published. Our underground detector has the highest spatial resolution which has been used in a nn¯ oscillation search with bound neutrons. With a fiducial exposure of 5. 56 kiloton-years, we find our search to be background-limited; that is, we observe several candidate events to occur {{at the same rate as}} predicted for backgrounds. It seems unlikely that future underground experiments can avoid becoming background-limited in comparable exposures. In the second part of this dissertation, a study of atmospheric neutrino reaction rates using multiprong events is presented. Based on kinematic and topological properties of 177 multiprong data events, an algorithm was devised to match a set of Monte Carlo events to each data event. The algorithm requires that for each Monte Carlo event selected, the total visible energy and the net event momentum are nearly equal to the corresponding values for the data event, and that the flavor tags and prong counts are compatible. In order to take into account ν μ → ν τ oscillation observed previously in atmospheric neutrino detectors (Super-Kamiokande, Soudan 2 and MACRO), each Monte Carlo event is weighted with neutrino oscillation probability corresponding to Δ m 2 = 3 × 10 − 3 eV 2 and sin 2 &thetas; = 1. From analysis of the matched Monte Carlo events, we conclude that 39. 7 ± 3. 1 % of multiprong data events in Soudan 2 have ν μ flavor...|$|E
40|$|This Memorandum of Understanding {{between the}} Test Beam {{collaborators}} and Fermilab {{is for the}} use of beam time at Fermilab during the Fall, 2005 Meson Test Beam Run. The experimenters plan to measure the energy, position, and time resolution of prototype modules of a large electromagnetic calorimeter proposed to be installed in the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The ALICE experiment is one of the three large approved LHC experiments, with ALICE placing special emphasis on the LHC heavy-ion program. The large electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) is a US initiative that is endorsed by the ALICE collaboration and is currently {{in the early stages of}} review by the Nuclear Physics Division of the DOE. The installation in the test beam at FNAL and test beam measurements will be carried out by the US members of the ALICE collaboration (ALICE-USA). The overall design of the ALICE EMCal is heavily influenced by its location within the ALICE L 3 magnet. The EMCal is to be located inside the large room temperature magnet within a cylindrical integration volume approximately l 12 cm deep, by 5. 6 m in length, sandwiched between the ALICE TPC space frame and the L 3 magnet coils. The chosen technology is a layered Pb-scintillator sampling calorimeter with a longitudinal pitch of 1. 6 mm Pb and 1. 6 mm scintillator. The full detector spans {eta} = - 0. 7 to {eta} = 0. 7 with an azimuthal acceptance of {Delta}{phi} = 120 {sup o}. The EMCal readout is of a ''Shish-Kabob'' type similar to the PHENIX Pb-scintillator sampling calorimeter in which the scintillation light is collected via wavelength shifting fibers running through the Pb-scintillator tiles perpendicular to the front surface. The detector is segmented into {approx} 14000 towers. The basic structural units of the calorimeter are supermodules, each subtending approximately {approx} 20 {sup o} in {Delta}{phi} and 0. 7 units in {Delta}{eta}. Supermodules are assembled from individual modules. The modules are further segmented into 2 x 2 individually read out towers. The fibers from an individual tower are grouped together to form readout tower bundles. These are each optically coupled to an avalanche photodiode (APO) via a short light guide to provide some spatial optical mixing and to match the fiber bundle to the APO. The module assembly is indicated in Figure l. The supermodules weigh about 9. 6 tons and are the basic units handled during installation. Each supermodule is roughly I 45 cm wide at the front surface by 350 cm long with an active depth of 24. 5 cm (at {eta} = 0) plus an additional 6. 6 cm of depth in structural plates. The physical characteristics of the ALICE EMCal are summarized in Table 1. The EMCal test beam measurements at FNAL will utilize a stacked 4 x 4 array of prototype EMCal modules (8 x 8 towers). All towers will be instrumented with the same model APO and preamplifier as will be used in the ALICE experiment and all channels will be readout with existing prototype front end electronics intended for use in ALICE. The goals of the test beam measurements are: To investigate the energy resolution, linearity, uniformity, and position resolution, using electron beams; To study the energy dependence of the response to electrons and hadrons to determine the particle identification capabilities of the EMCal by shower shape; And to investigate the timing characteristics of the energy signal for crude time-of-flight measurement ({approx} 1 ns) for use for <b>anti-neutron</b> rejection. Measurements will be made for comparison with different signal shaping times in the front end electronics...|$|E
