25|$|<b>Aeroelasticity</b> {{involves}} {{not just}} the external aerodynamic loads {{and the way they}} change but also the structural, damping and mass characteristics of the aircraft. Prediction involves making a mathematical model of the aircraft as a series of masses connected by springs and dampers which are tuned to represent the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft structure. The model also includes details of applied aerodynamic forces and how they vary.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly <b>aeroelasticity,</b> to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E

50|$|The same {{problems}} affect modern aircraft as well, but today's wings are engineered with greater stiffness, {{to reduce the}} problem. Once the plane is built and flown, the flight control software is then adjusted to correct {{for the loss of}} control due to <b>aeroelasticity.</b> However, this simply hides the problem; the <b>aeroelasticity</b> still exists and is affecting the overall control authority. To correct this the flight controller uses more control input to offset any loss of effectiveness, which increases the spanwise torque loads on the aircraft's wing.|$|E
