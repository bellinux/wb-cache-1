5|$|The Commission on Constitutional Revision {{presented}} {{its report}} and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, {{and continued to}} work with them to draft a final consensus version. The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> and women, following passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1944, under {{conditions}} of severe racism, a race riot broke out in Guam at a naval base. In March 1945 a Seabee battalion of 1,000 <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> staged a hunger strike at their base, Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California, in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, Fleet Admiral Ernest King and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert Lester Granger on a plan for total integration of the races within the Navy. The Port Chicago disaster had helped catalyze the drive to implement new standards.|$|E

5|$|As Southern {{states began}} the process of forming governments, Johnson's {{policies}} received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners {{to ensure that the}} war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining {{facial hair}} is more {{prevalent}} among <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> {{than in other}} male populations in the U.S. In fact, the soul patch is so named because <b>African-American</b> <b>men,</b> particularly jazz musicians, popularized the style. The preference for facial hair among <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> is due partly to personal taste, {{but also because they}} are more prone than other ethnic groups to develop a condition known as pseudofolliculitis barbae, commonly referred to as razor bumps, many prefer not to shave.|$|E

25|$|In addition, nearly 200,000 <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors. Most were escaped slaves.

25|$|Virginia State's first {{president}} was John Mercer Langston, former dean of Howard University's law school, and later elected to Congress {{as the first}} African-American Representative from Virginia (and the last until 1972).

Hughes did, however, show a respect and love for his fellow black man (and woman).

25|$|After New Orleans fell to Admiral David Farragut in April 1862, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler {{headquartered}} his 12,000-man Army of the Gulf in New Orleans.

25|$|Douglass thought such a {{strategy}} was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once <b>African-American</b> <b>men</b> had the vote. Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.|$|E
