25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} (also {{known as}} paracusia) are {{the perception of}} sound without outside stimulus. Auditory hallucinations {{are the most common}} type of hallucination. Auditory hallucinations can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{study examined the}} predictive relationship among the dimensions of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> {{and the presence of}} depression in chronic schizophrenia. Forty seven out-patients from the Inner City Community Mental Health Service participated, all of whom had a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and reported experiencing <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> The measures included the Calgary Rating Scale fur Schizophrenia, the <b>Auditory</b> <b>Hallucinations</b> Rating Scale, the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire and three questions relating to insight into <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> from the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-Expanded Edition. Consistent with other reports, the present study found a prevalence of depressive symptoms in over 40 % of the sample. All of the dimensions of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> together accounted for 42 % of the variance in depression scores but there was no salient individual dimension that could account for a significant proportion of the variance.

Cognitions have been reported by patients as a trigger of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> but the role of these preceding thoughts has not been causally determined. Therefore, the role of cognition in triggering <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> was tested in an experimental study. Thirty individuals who experienced <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in social situations entered a neutral social situation presented using virtual reality.

2500|$|Given his {{reported}} symptoms, one modern view is {{that his}} death {{was a result of}} syphilis, which he may have contracted during his student days, and which would have remained latent during most of his marriage. According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar Eric Sams, Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of mercury poisoning, mercury at this time being a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a [...] "gelatinous" [...] tumor {{at the base of the}} brain; it may have represented a colloid cyst, a craniopharyngioma, a chordoma, or a chordoid meningioma. In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations, such as Schumann reported. It has also been hypothesised that he may have suffered from either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and bipolar II disorder. Other sources have supported a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, citing his mood swings and changes in productivity. Schumann did indeed hear an [...] "A" [...] at the end of his life. It was a form of tinnitus, or perhaps an <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> related to his major depressive episode. At times, he had musical hallucinations which were longer than just the single [...] "A", but his diaries include comments from him about hearing that annoying single note. However, he didn't go mad from hearing it; he was suffering from a major depressive episode, and he experienced problems with his mental health long before he mentioned the tinnitus.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end."

40|$|In a {{population-based}} {{study of}} <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in almost 4000 children aged 7 and 8 {{years in the}} Dutch province of Groningen, a one-year prevalence rate of 9 % was found. The majority of the children did not suffer much from the voices. Examination of a case-control sample of 694 children revealed little differences between children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and controls in pre- and perinatal complications and early development problems. However, the children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> had more parental reported somatic complaints. The case-control sample was re-assessed after five years, {{in order to examine}} the course of the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Also, risk factors for voice hearing persistence, new incidence closer to puberty and possible protective factors were studied. In total, 337 children could be included, equally divided over the groups with and without <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> at baseline. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> persisted in almost a quarter of the children, whereas 9 % of the control children reported these for the first time. Predictive of voice hearing persistence was hearing more than one voice at baseline and attribution of the voices to an external source. The children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> at follow-up had experienced more traumatic and stressful events, had more delusional ideation, more somatic complaints and more thought problems. Furthermore it was found that a better social cognition (as measured by a theory-of-mind task) was protective against delusion formation in children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Follow-up examination of the case-control children in early adulthood will put the results in a wider perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are a {{commonly}} experienced phenomenon. Theories {{have been devised}} {{in order to help}} explain how and why this phenomenon occurs, some attributing its occurrence to stressful life events, other explaining it as originating from misattributed thoughts. This study tested the relation between patients who experience <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and their pattern of metacognitions and thought strategies. Method: 12 participants suffering from <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> from different parts of Norway were assessed by following instruments: categories of worry (AnTI), metacognitions (MCQ- 30), strategies for thought control (TCQ), beliefs about <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (BAVQ-R) and metacognitions with regard to <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (MCQ-VH). Results: Results revealed that participants scored high on positive and negative meta-beliefs in regard to <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> There was further an association between measure of meta-worry as indicated by AnTI and interpretation of voices as indicated by BAVQ-R Earlier research on coping with voices had proposed that distraction was used by voice hearers who cope poorly. Correlational analyses found no relation between beliefs about malevolence and omnipotence of voices and distraction, although participants used distraction as a thought control strategy in order to cope with their voices. Conclusion: This study indicates that metacognitions might be an important factor in perpetuating <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and the discomfort this experience entails. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.  </p...|$|R
60|$|Again {{there is}} the noise made {{apparently}} by violent movement of heavy furniture, which on immediate examination (as in Scott's case at Abbotsford) is found {{not to have been}} moved. The writer is acquainted with a dog, a collie, which was once shut up alone in a room where this disturbance occurred. The dog was much alarmed and howled fearfully, but it soon ceased to weigh on his spirits. When phantasms are occasionally seen by respectable witnesses, where these noises and movements occur, the haunted house is of a healthy, orthodox, modern type. But the phenomena are nothing less than modern, for Mather, Sinclair, Paracelsus, Wierus, Glanvill, Bovet, Baxter and other old writers are full of precisely these combinations of sounds and sights, while many cases occur in old French literature, old Latin literature, and among races of the lower barbaric and savage grades of culture. One or two curious circumstances have rather escaped the notice of philosophers though not of Thyraeus. First, the loudest of the unexplained sounds are occasionally not audible to all, so that (as when the noise seems to be caused by furniture dragged about) we may conjecture with Thyraeus, that there is no real movement of the atmosphere, that the apparent crash is an <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> The planks and heavy objects at Abbotsford had not been stirred, as the loud noises overhead indicated, when Scott came to examine them.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{a common}} symptom {{experience}} of individuals with psychotic disorders and are often experienced as persistent, distressing, and disruptive. This case series examined the lived experiences of four individuals treated (successfully or unsuccessfully) with low-frequency (1 [*]Hz) rTMS for <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Methods. A phenomenological approach was used and modified to involve some predetermined data structuring to accommodate for expected cognitive impairments of participants {{and the impact of}} rTMS on <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Data on thoughts and feelings in relation to the helpful, unhelpful, and other effects of rTMS on <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> on well-being, functioning, and the immediate environment were collected using semistructured interviews. Results. All four participants noted some improvements in their well-being following treatment and none reported a worsening of their symptoms. Only two participants noted an improvement in the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and only one of them reported an improvement that was sustained after treatment completion. Conclusion. We suggest that there are useful findings in the study worth further exploration, specifically in relation to the role of an individual’s acceptance and ownership of the illness process in relation to this biomedical intervention. More mixed methods research is required to examine rTMS for <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations...</b>|$|R
