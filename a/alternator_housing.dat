50|$|Automotive alternators {{require a}} voltage {{regulator}} which operates by modulating the small field current to produce a constant voltage at the battery terminals. Early designs (c.1960s-1970s) used a discrete device mounted elsewhere in the vehicle. Intermediate designs (c.1970s-1990s) incorporated the voltage regulator into the <b>alternator</b> <b>housing.</b> Modern designs {{do away with the}} voltage regulator altogether; voltage regulation is now a function of the electronic control unit (ECU). The field current is much smaller than the output current of the alternator; for example, a 70 A alternator may need only 7 A of field current. The field current is supplied to the rotor windings by slip rings. The low current and relatively smooth slip rings ensure greater reliability and longer life than that obtained by a DC generator with its commutator and higher current being passed through its brushes.|$|E

These cast-aluminum parts were roughly 60% lighter than corresponding parts of cast iron. A cast aluminum part had the benefit of reduced section thickness where strength was not a vital consideration. Section thickness of cast-iron parts were often dictated by casting practice, which required at least 3/16 in to ensure good castings. Exterior decorative parts stamped from aluminum were lighter than similar chromium-plated zinc castings. The entire grille and surrounding molding on the Valiant weighed only 3 lb. If this same assembly had been made of die-cast zinc, as many grilles of the era were, it would have weighed an estimated 13 lb. An estimated 102 lb—about 4% of a Valiant's total shipping weight—was saved with the 60 lb of aluminum parts.|$|E

50|$|Sam Redfield of the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group (AIDG) has {{developed}} a pico-hydro generator made from common PVC pipe and a modified Toyota <b>alternator</b> <b>housed</b> in a five gallon bucket. The generator was developed to provide power to communities without access to the electricity grid in developing countries. Envisioned as an energy source to charge cell phones, provide lighting and charge batteries, the generator {{is designed to be}} made by artisans with basic skills and can be built for less than $150.00. The Toyota alternator used in the generator is converted to a permanent magnet alternator allowing it to generate power at low RPMs. The Five Gallon Bucket Hydroelectric Generator {{was the subject of a}} work group at the 2008 International Development Design Summit (IDDS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the Summer of 2013 an energy project in Abra Malaga, Peru was completed using the bucket generator.|$|R
5|$|The A Station {{generated}} electricity {{using three}} turbo alternators; two 69 megawatt (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243MW. At {{the time of}} its commissioning, the 105MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78MW and associated with a 6MW <b>house</b> <b>alternator,</b> giving these units a total rating of 100MW. The third unit consisted of a 66MW machine associated with a 6MW <b>house</b> <b>alternator,</b> giving the unit a rating of 72MW. Combined, these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260MW, making the site's generating capacity 503MW. All of the station's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox, fuelled by pulverised coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation.|$|R
40|$|The use of Power Electronic {{circuits}} {{has helped}} to advance the technology of automotive alternators. The use of a Switched-Mode Rectifier (SMR) allows the alternator to run at a load-matched condition, optimizing power and efficiency over all operating speeds. However, the use of SMR's has largely been focused on designs for 42 V alternators. This thesis presents the design, build, and characterization of an SMR-based alternator that provides improved power and efficiency at the present automotive standard of 14 V. The SMR-based machine was built from commercial electronic devices and packaged such {{that it could be}} fully integrated into the <b>alternator</b> <b>housing</b> without impacting the physical structure or reliability. The SMR-based alternator was characterized in a laboratory environment (25 °C ambient temperature) over the standard operating range of 1500 rpm (idle speed) to 6000 rpm (cruising speed). The alternator operated in a load-matched condition, achieving maximum power output up to 2400 rpm and achieved cruising speed output power of 2178 W at full field current of 4. 3 A. by Amando Mesa.

50|$|The camp {{produced}} its own electricity with a steam vessel, {{coupled to}} an <b>alternator.</b> The power <b>house</b> originally {{was part of}} the agricultural research station. The wood fired steam vessel propelled the alternator which produced a voltage of 110 V for the illumination of the camp and the fencing. The power house also played an important role for the operation of the clandestine transmitter of the camp underground organisation. From 1942 up to its discovery in July 1943, the voltage was raised secretly in the evening hours to provide sufficient voltage for the transmission equipment.|$|R
25|$|The AS332 Super Puma {{is powered}} by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 {{turboshaft}} engines which drive the rotorcraft's four-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor as well two separate hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical <b>alternators.</b> Fuel is <b>housed</b> in six internal fuel tanks, additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a crashworthy plumbing design and fire detection and suppression systems are installed in the engine bay. The monocoque tail boom is fitted with tail rotor strike protection, the forward portion of the boom accommodated a luggage compartment. The retractable tricycle landing gear is designed for high energy absorption qualities.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability is an {{international}} issue with increasing concern and becomes a crucial driver for the industry in international competition. Sustainability encompasses the three dimensions: environment, society and economy. This paper presents the results from a sustainability assessment of a product. To prevent burden shifting, the whole life cycle of the products is necessary {{to be taken into}} account. For the environmental dimension, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been practiced for nearly 40 years and is the only one standardised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (14040 and 14044). Life cycle approaches for the social and economic dimensions are currently under development. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is a complementary implementation of the three techniques: LCA (environmental), life cycle costing (LCC - economic) and social LCA (SLCA - social). This contribution applies the state-of-the-art LCSA on remanufacturing of alternators aiming at supporting managers and product developers in their decision-making to design product and plant. The alternator is the electricity generator in the automobile vehicle which produces the needed electricity. LCA and LCC are used to assess three different alternator design scenarios (namely conventional, lightweight and ultra-lightweight). The LCA and LCC results show that the conventional alternator is the most promising one. LCSA of three different locations (Germany, India and Sierra Leone) for setting the remanufacturing mini-factory, a worldwide applicable container, are investigated on all three different sustainability dimensions: LCA, LCC and SLCA. The location choice is determined by the SLCA and the design alternatives by the LCA and LCC. The case study results show that remanufacturing potentially causes about 12 % of the emissions and costs compared to producing new parts. The conventional <b>alternator</b> with <b>housing</b> of iron cast performs better in LCA and LCC than the lightweight alternatives with aluminium housing. The optimal location of remanufacturing is dependent on where the used alternators are sourced and where the remanufactured alternators are going to be used. Important measures to improve the sustainability of the remanufacturing process in life cycle perspective are to confirm if the energy efficiency of the remanufactured part is better than the new part, as the use phase dominates from an environmental and economical point of view. The SLCA should be developed further, focusing on the suitable indicators and conducting further case studies including the whole life cycle...|$|R
