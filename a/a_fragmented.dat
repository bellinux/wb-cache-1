5|$|The {{many letters}} in the novel written by Lambert are also based on Balzac's life.

5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, consisting of <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within {{an environment of}} moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it further to a deep depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|Argentina was <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> nation (since the 1852 {{downfall}} of Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas), with the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires each vying for supremacy. Flores approached the Buenos Aires Minister of War, Bartolomé Mitre, agreeing {{to throw the}} support of the Colorados behind Buenos Aires in exchange for subsequent Argentine assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in Montevideo (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served Buenos Aires with fierce determination. They played a decisive role in the Battle of Pavón on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} typhoon status, Paka strengthened fairly quickly, and by December 12 {{it reached}} sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) for a ten-minute (10 min) duration, or 215km/h (135mph) over a one-minute (1 min) duration. Subsequently, it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased. However, Paka again re-intensified, and at 1200UTC on December 14 it attained the unofficial ranking of super typhoon status while over the open Pacific Ocean. At the same time, the JMA classified it with 10 min sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). After reaching its initial peak intensity, Typhoon Paka began to weaken as it approached the southern Mariana Islands; the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar from Guam revealed {{the presence of}} a primary eyewall of 74km (46mi) in diameter, with <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> inner wall cloud of 19km (11mi) in diameter. Additionally, satellite imagery indicated an eyewall mesovortex within the eye of the typhoon. It slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward, and at 0530UTC on December 16 the northern portion of the outer eyewall of Paka passed over the island of Rota; 20minutes later, the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern Guam. As it tracked through the Rota Channel, the center of Paka passed about 8km (5mi) north of the northern tip of Guam, its closest approach to the island.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Birmingham and Black Country urban areas were {{coalescing}} into a single extensive conurbation spanning the borders of three counties: Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. Other similar urban areas in England, such as Lancashire, Tyneside, London and within Yorkshire West Riding, had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> local government infrastructure. The Local Government Act 1958 appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a West Midlands Special Review Area, whose recommendations would ultimately form the West Midlands Order 1965 legislation. A second report known as the West Midlands General Review looked into the administrative authorities within the wider region, including the remainder of Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu (pinyin: Sun Zi; c. 544 BC – 496 BC) was {{a native}} of the Qi state (now Huimin county in Shandong) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, that was characterised by warring factions and <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> state. He came to the {{attention}} of King He Lu of Wu, who was impressed by his 13-chapter military treatise, The Art of War. In 512 BC, He Lu made Sun Tzu his Commander-in-Chief of the Wu army. For almost 20 years, the armies of Wu were victorious over their hereditary enemies, the kingdoms of Chu and Yue. In 496 BC, after He Lu died from his wounds in battle, his son, Fu Chai succeeded him. After numerous victories in battles, Fu Chai became arrogant and began to indulge in merrymaking. In time, the king started to disregard Sun Tzu's counsel and began to distance himself from Sun Tzu. Sensing this, Sun Tzu wisely gave up his position and left Wu for Qi in retirement. Fu Chai and his generals did not follow Sun Tzu's precepts and his kingdom was subsequently conquered by Chu in 473 BC. Out of shame, Fu Chai committed suicide after he had fled with the remnants of his defeated army.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} Rowling created {{is intimately}} connected to reality. The British magical {{community of the}} Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, European folklore, classical mythology and alchemy, incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands, magic plants, potions, spells, flying broomsticks, centaurs, and other magical creatures, the Deathly Hallows, and the Philosopher's Stone, beside others invented by Rowling. While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings Middle-earth a mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within {{the real world and}} contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life, with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in southeast England. The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population.|$|E

40|$|Fluoroquinolones such as {{ciprofloxacin}} and ofloxacin are potent {{antimicrobial agents}} that antagonize the A subunit of DNA gyrase. We selected and mapped a novel fluoroquinolone resistance gene on the Staphylococcus aureus chromosome. Resistant mutants were selected with ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin and were uniformly localized to the <b>A</b> <b>fragment</b> of chromosomal DNA digested with SmaI and arrayed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Several mutants (cfxB, ofxC) were genetically mapped between the thr and trp loci in the <b>A</b> <b>fragment.</b> <b>A</b> majority of <b>A</b> <b>fragment</b> fluoroquinolone resistance mutations {{were associated with}} reduced susceptibility to novobiocin, an antagonist of the B subunit of DNA gyrase. Two genes previously associated with fluoroquinolone resistance, the gyrA gene of DNA gyrase and the norA gene (associated with decreased drug accumulation), were localized to the G and D fragments, respectively. Thus, the fluoroquinolone resistance mutations in the <b>A</b> <b>fragment</b> are distinct from previously identified fluoroquinolone resistance mutations in gyrA and norA. Whether mutations in the <b>A</b> <b>fragment</b> after <b>a</b> second topoisomerase or another gene controlling supercoiling or affect drug permeation is unknown...|$|R
5|$|Until {{the late}} 18th century, {{the island of}} Madagascar was ruled by <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> {{assortment}} of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar {{by a series of}} Merina nobles. The monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a popular uprising in 2009, president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar {{is a member of the}} United Nations, the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.|$|E
5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, he possibly acceded to power over <b>a</b> <b>fragmented</b> Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region.|$|E
