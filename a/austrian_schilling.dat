50|$|The euro {{was founded}} on 1 January 1999, when it became the {{currency}} of over 300 million people in Europe.

A 20 Reichsmark note was introduced in 1939, using a design taken from an unissued <b>Austrian</b> 100 <b>schilling</b> banknote type. Five Reichsmark notes were issued in 1942.

As a member of the economic and monetary union of the European Union (EMU), Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member countries, especially with Germany. On 1 January 1999, Austria introduced the new Euro currency for accounting purposes.

5000|$|In 1987, {{it became}} known {{according}} to a report in a news magazine profile that Lichal had an order for 50,000 pieces of tracer practice ammunition for antiaircraft guns worth 35 million <b>Austrian</b> <b>Schilling</b> that had been awarded to the Swiss manufacturer Rheinmetall Air Defence, although the French supplier Matra Manurhin Defense an offer for 15 million Schillings. At the time of the award, the Bundesheer had ammunition reserves of 2 years. Lichal had ordered the Bundesheer at least three times to pass the more favorable offer from Matra. In 1988, a criminal investigation for abuse of authority was introduced, which included house searches at Lichal's home, his secretaries Michael Spindelegger and Walter Schön home's, and the then Oerlikon-General representatives in Austria's homes'. Lichal and Schön were close friends and Spindelegger was a member of Cartellverband. One sticky note found read [...] "2 party financing; and two million: Value of contract: 35 million Spindelegger: 1". Prosecutors suspected an illegal party financing for the ÖVP, after which was considered non-partisan, but the ÖVP Minister of Justice Egmont Foregger initiated disciplinary proceedings against the investigating prosecutor and the case of the Supreme Public Prosecutor that rendered the investigations invalid in 1990.|$|E

40|$|Having {{improved}} steadily from 1988 to 1991 Austria's international {{competitive position}} {{in terms of}} unit labour costs in manufacturing deteriorated in 1992. With the business cycle heading downwards productivity growth slowed and unit labour costs rose by 2. 2 percent following a decade of broad stability. While unit labour costs in competitor countries rose 1 ½ percentage points faster on average than in Austria, relative unit labour costs in Austrian manufacturing edged up 0. 4 percent in a common currency as the exchange rate turmoil in autumn 1992 led to an effective revaluation of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>schilling</b> by about 2 percent.

40|$|The {{international}} {{competitive position}} of the Austrian manufacturing sector deteriorated in 1990 despite stable unit labour costs. The hefty increase in hourly labour costs by 7. 1 percent was offset {{by an increase in}} productivity of equal size; but at the same time, the trade-weighted value of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>schilling</b> rose by 3. 4 percent, resulting in a worsening of the international unit labour cost position vis-à-vis Austria's trading partners by 0. 7 percent. Hourly labour costs in Austria's manufacturing sector were AS 202 in 1990, reaching the EC average, and were about as high as in France and Italy. Productivity in Austria's manufacturing sector which was only about two third of that in West Germany in 1970, attained the West German level in 1990.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{focuses on}} {{consequences}} that a Common Currency Area imposes on the wage and price formation {{in a small}} open economy. Optimum Currency Areas (OCA) can be defined in many ways but the concept can be simplified to {{a high degree of}} labor mobility and real wage flexibility. Assuming an OCA consists of several regions this implies that shifts in relative prices among those regions should not induce movements in regional unemployment or inflation but either migration or real wage adjustment. The presence of an OCA between Austria and Germany is of special interest because the <b>Austrian</b> <b>schilling</b> can be regarded as pegged to the deutsche mark since the 1950 's and the European Monetary Union forces not only small open economies to adjust their price and wage formation in accordance with stable member countries. Using a structural VAR approach, shocks to the nominal effective exchange rate are interpreted as shifts in relative prices. A test for an OCA between both countries looks on effects that exchange rate shocks have on unemployment and real wages in the tradables and nontradables sectors of a small open economy. ...|$|E
