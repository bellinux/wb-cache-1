Given the importance of system <b>and</b> data <b>quality</b> to an organization, it is relevant to highlight their importance on organizational performance in the Kingdom of Bahrain. This research aims to discover whether system <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> data <b>quality</b> are related, <b>and</b> to study the impact of system <b>and</b> data <b>quality</b> on organizational success. A theoretical model based on previous research is used to show the relationship between data <b>and</b> system <b>quality,</b> <b>and</b> organizational impact. We hypothesize, first, that system quality is positively associated with organizational impact, secondly that system quality is positively associated with data <b>quality,</b> <b>and</b> finally that data quality is positively associated with organizational impact. A questionnaire was conducted among public and private organizations in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The results show that there is a strong association between data <b>and</b> system <b>quality,</b> that affects organizational success. Keywords—Data quality, performance, system quality...|$|R

This paper examines the relationship between accruals <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> disclosure <b>quality,</b> <b>and</b> investigates whether they are complements or substitutes in explaining the time-series variation in portfolio returns. Applying portfolio groupings, we find a positive association between accruals <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> disclosure <b>quality,</b> suggesting that firms with higher disclosure quality engage less in earnings management and have higher accruals quality. Asset pricing tests show that an accruals <b>quality</b> factor <b>and</b> a disclosure <b>quality</b> factor explain the time-series variation in the excess returns of similar sets of portfolios. This suggests that they contain similar information and confirms the substitutive nature of accruals <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> disclosure <b>quality</b> factors...|$|R
