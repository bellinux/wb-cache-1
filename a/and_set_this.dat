5|$|Other {{types of}} {{religious}} texts give {{evidence for the}} myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death {{as well as the}} resolution of the dispute between Horus <b>and</b> <b>Set.</b> <b>This</b> narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date back to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages {{in the development of the}} myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.|$|E
500|$|Acoustic guitar, {{violin and}} drums {{accompany}} Eminem's verses. The lyrics transition from discussing {{positive aspects of}} love to describing violent events. Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls you both, so they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>this</b> house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E

[...] But McElroy wonders [...] "how Sullivan came to discover <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>this</b> libretto, by a relative beginner, so quickly?" [...] He notes that a 13 March 1875 gossip column in the Athenæum said that Sullivan was working on new music for a piece at the St. James's, although for a different opera. [...] From this, McElroy speculates that Stephenson was already working on the libretto of The Zoo for the St. James, while Sullivan was still busy preparing for the opening of Trial: ...|$|E

I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that their devotion was manifested.

60|$|I {{soon learned}} to cast away one other {{illusion}} of 'popular poetry.' I {{learned from the}} people themselves, before I learned it from any book, that they cannot separate {{the idea of an}} art or a craft from the idea of a cult with ancient technicalities and mysteries. They can hardly separate mere learning from witchcraft, and are fond of words and verses that keep half their secret to themselves. Indeed, it is certain that before the counting-house had created a new class and a new art without breeding and without ancestry, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>this</b> art and this class between the hut and the castle, and between the hut and the cloister, the art of the people was as closely mingled with the art of the coteries as was the speech of the people that delighted in rhythmical animation, in idiom, in images, in words full of far-off suggestion, with the unchanging speech of the poets.|$|E
60|$|At last, Hans {{thought it}} was time to have his breakfast, so he got up and put on his clothes. He took plenty of time to his breakfast, and then went out to get his horse and cart ready. The others had taken {{everything}} that was any good, so that he had a difficulty in scraping together four wheels of different sizes and fixing them to an old cart, and he could find no other horses than a pair of old hacks. He did not know where it lay, but he followed the track of the other carts, and in that way came to it all right. On coming to the gate leading into the forest, he was unfortunate enough to break it in pieces, so he took a huge stone that was lying on the field, seven ells long, and seven ells broad, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>this</b> in the gap, then he went on and joined the others. These laughed at him heartily, for they had laboured as hard as they could since daybreak, and had helped each other to fell trees {{and put them on the}} carts, so that all of these were now loaded except one.|$|E
