5000|$|Post-structuralism {{differs from}} most other {{approaches}} to international politics {{because it does}} not see itself as a theory, school or paradigm which produces a single account of the subject matter. Instead, post-structuralism is an <b>approach,</b> <b>attitude,</b> or ethos that pursues critique in particular way. Post-structuralism sees critique as an inherently positive exercise that establishes the conditions of possibility for pursuing alternatives. It states that [...] "Every understanding of international politics depends upon abstraction, representation and interpretation". Scholars associated with post-structuralism in international relations include Richard K. Ashley, James Der Derian, Michael J. Shapiro, R.B.J. Walker, and Lene Hansen.|$|E

40|$|A {{scheme for}} the control and {{maneuvering}} of a large flexible spacecraft by means of two flexible AMCD's using noncontacting magnetic suspension is presented. The system consists of a flexible vehicle, two flexible rings and a magnetic suspension and driving assembly. The necessary skewing of the rings for maneuvering of the vehicle is accomplished by moving the pairs of magnets along tracks distributed around the circumference of the vehicle. The equations of motion for each subsystem are derived by the Lagrangian <b>approach.</b> <b>Attitude</b> motions are {{described in terms of}} quasi-coordinates. For small vehicle angular rates and rings attitude motions, an ordering scheme can be used to separate the equations of motion according to the magnitude of the terms. The ordered equations of motion lead to a linear time-variant optimal control problem for the maneuvering of the spacecraft...|$|E

40|$|Proximity {{operations}} can {{be defined}} as the maneuvering of two or more spacecraft within 1 nautical mile range, with relative velocity less than 10 feet per second. The passive vehicle is nontranslating and should provide for maintenance of the desired <b>approach</b> <b>attitude.</b> It must accommodate the active (translating) vehicle induced structural loads and performance characteristics (mating hardware tolerances), and support sensor compatibility (transponder, visual targets, etc.). The active vehicle must provide adequate sensor systems (relative state information, field-of-view, redundancy), flight control hardware (thruster sizing, minimal cross-coupling, performance margins, redundancy) and software (reconfigurable, attitude/rate modes, translation and rotation fine control authority) characteristic, and adequate non-propulsive consumables such as power. Operational concerns must be considered. These include the following: (1) the desired approach trajectory and relative orientation; (2) the active vehicle thruster plume effects (forces, torques, contamination) on the passive vehicle; and (3) procedures for contingencies such as loss of communications, sensor or propulsion failures, and target vehicle loss of control...|$|E

The paper discusses the fundamental epistemological shortcomings of different <b>approaches</b> to <b>attitude</b> research. Three different orders of analysis are attempted and reflected upon, a standardized quantitative analysis, a discourse analysis and a deconstructive, nonessentialist analysis.

In this respect, the papers “failure ” to set up a new and improved <b>approach</b> to <b>attitude</b> research, and its content to point out the shortcomings of the current approaches, may not be a failure as much as a conscious plea {{to do away with the}} notion of a objective or neutral investigation of opinions...|$|R

40|$|Small {{scale model}} {{acoustic}} experiments {{were conducted to}} measure the noise produced in the flyover and sideline planes by an engine under the wing externally blown flap configuration in its <b>approach</b> <b>attitude.</b> Broadband low frequency noise reductions as large as 9 dB were produced by reducing the separation distance between the nozzle exhaust plane and the flaps. Experiments were also conducted to determine the noise suppression effectiveness in comparison with a reference configuration of three passive types of devices that were located on the jet impingement surfaces of the reference configuration. These devices produced noise reductions that varied up to 10 dB at reduced separation distances. In addition, a qualitative estimate of the noise suppression characteristics of the separate devices was made. Finally static aerodynamic performance data were obtained to evaluate the penalties incurred by these suppression devices. The test results suggest that further parametric studies are {{required in order to}} understand more fully the noise mechanisms that are affected by the suppression devices used...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dual-stage control system design method for the rotational maneuver and vibration stabilization of a spacecraft with flexible appendages. In this design <b>approach,</b> <b>attitude</b> control system and vibration suppression were designed separately using lower order model. The design of attitude controller {{was based on}} sliding mode control (SMC) theory leading to a discontinuous control law. This controller accomplishes asymptotic attitude maneuvering in the closed-loop system and is insensitive to the interaction of elastic modes and uncertainty in the system. The shaped command input controller based on component synthesis vibration suppression (CSVS) method is designed for reduction of flexible mode vibration, which only requires information about natural frequency and damping of the closed system. Additionally, to extend the CSVS method to the system with on-off actuators, pulse-width pulse-frequency (PWPF) modulation is employed to control the thruster firing and integrated with the CSVS method. Simulation results have been proven the potential of this technique to control flexible spacecraft...|$|E

Three types of nozzle configurations are evaluated: a circular nozzle with external deflector mounted above the wing, a slot nozzle with external deflector mounted on the wing and a slot nozzle mounted on the wing. Nozzle exhaust plane locations with respect to the wing leading edge are varied from 10 to 46 percent chord (flaps retracted) with flap angles of 20 (takeoff altitude) and 60 (<b>approach</b> <b>attitude).</b> Perceived noise levels (PNL) are calculated as a function of flyover distance at 152 m altitude. From these plots, static EPNL values, defined as flyover relative noise levels, are calculated and plotted as a function of lift and thrust ratios. From such plots the acoustic benefits attributable to variations in nozzle/deflector/wing geometry at full scale are assessed for equal aerodynamic performance...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} common {{approaches to}} eco-art practice and its established discourses. Through {{a critical review}} of the field it identifies problems in practice and theory that are potentially counter-productive. It outlines methods used in eco-art that, whilst seeking to address environmental concerns, may unintentionally perpetuate the <b>approaches</b> and <b>attitudes</b> of the prevailing view. The thesis argues that as these <b>approaches</b> and <b>attitudes</b> are widely understood to lie at the cause of current problems its continued use is inappropriate for engaging with ecological issues. In response to this problem the thesis draws together insights from arts practice and theory, Systems Thinking, Cybernetics, Artificial Life research, Deep Ecology and Process Thinking. It develops an experimental framework to guide the initiation, production, dissemination and evaluation of arts practice, which can critically engage with the <b>approaches</b> and <b>attitudes</b> of the prevailing view, but do so without perpetuating these. For {{the purposes of this}} thesis the framework is called a process aesthetic. The thesis describes how the process aesthetic is developed and tested through the undertaking of new creative practice, and the critical reflection upon this. The written component of the thesis concludes with an evaluation of the relevance and potential of a process aesthetic, and a consideration of what it might offer to our understanding of ecological art. The thesis contributes to the field of eco-art by drawing upon thinking and practices normally considered peripheral to its discourses. This identifies problems, which contradict its aim of challenging the <b>approaches</b> and <b>attitudes</b> of the prevailing view - problems which to date have been under-acknowledged and not adequately theorised. It establishes that arts practice guided by the process aesthetic demonstrates an approach that can overcome problems recognised within existing eco-art and can act as a critical tool for disturbing the <b>approaches</b> and <b>attitudes</b> of the prevailing view. The thesis establishes that the process aesthetic {{can be used as a}} guide for future eco-arts practice and can be a means of regrouping existing artworks, which would normally be overlooked by eco-art discussions. This extends the diversity of eco-art discussions to positively broaden its critical discourses. It thus offers a new and appropriate methodology for arts practice that seeks to engage with environmental issues and ecological thinking...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at model scale to determine the noise produced in the flyover and sideline planes at reduced separation distances between the nozzle exhaust plane and the flaps of an under-the-wing (UTW) externally blown flap (EBF) configuration in its <b>approach</b> <b>attitude.</b> Tests were also made to determine the noise suppression effectiveness of two types of passive devices which were located on the jet impingement surfaces of the configuration. In addition, static aerodynamic performance data were obtained to evaluate the penalties produced by these suppression devices. Broadband low frequency noise reductions were achieved by reducing the separation distance between the nozzle and flaps. However, mid and high frequency noise was produced which exceeded that of the reference configuration. Two passive noise suppression devices located on the flaps produced moderate to large noise reductions at reduced separation distances. Consideration of the static aerodynamic performance data obtained for the configurations tested suggests that specific broadband noise suppression characteristics may be obtained through a trade-off with aerodynamic performance penalties by the careful selection of suppression devices...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for a three-element high-lift system with a half-span flap and both a full- and three-quarter span slat. The simplified wing spanned the wind-tunnel test section with no wing sweep or wing tip. Full- and part-span slat configurations were tested to investigate the three-dimensional effects of a finite-span slat in a landing configuration. With a part-span slat, flow visualization and surface pressures revealed two vortices at the flap tip and one at the slat tip. Compared to the full-span slat case, the part-span slat configuration stalled at a lower angle of attack and yielded reduced lift at all angles of attack. At a representative <b>approach</b> <b>attitude</b> (10 deg), wake surveys indicated comparable induced drag for the full- and part-span slat configurations while the profile drag was more than doubled with a part-span slat. The vorticity contribution of the slat-tip vortex was minimal, suggesting that the vortex dissipates through viscous interaction with the main-element boundary layer. The addition of a lower-surface fence at the slat tip yielded two co-rotating vortices and partially alleviated the profile drag increase of the part-span slat...|$|E
40|$|The {{sound field}} {{produced}} by the interaction of a subsonic jet with a large-scale model of the under the wing externally blown flap in an <b>approach</b> <b>attitude</b> was analyzed.

An analytical expression is derived which incorporates two available theories and experimental data; the expression predicts the sound field along a circular arc of approximately 120 deg measured from the upstream jet axis in the fly-over plane. The analysis compares favorably with test results obtained from two large-scale models, one using cold air from a conical nozzle and the other using hot gas from a TF- 34 turbofan engine having a conical exhaust nozzle with a 12 lobe internal forced mixer. The frequency at which the peak sound pressure level occurs appears to be governed by a phenomenon which produces periodic formation and shedding of large-scale turbulence structures from the nozzle lip...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{principles}} in the ideology which underpins education {{is the value of}} children’s family experience. Central to this idea is the view of parents as important. Parenting has become a vital dimension in contemporary education. Parenting discourses traditionally focus on such concepts as parenting style, <b>approach,</b> <b>attitude</b> or practice. The main consideration behind these concepts is what parents appear to be doing at a single point of time, referring to parenting per se. This paper takes on the notion of disposition in order to understand urban Chinese mothers’ habitual and characteristic ways of child rearing. It presents evidence to show that a group of Chinese mothers had parenting dispositions of motivation, responsibility and anxiety. Data came from a series of conversations between 50 Chinese mothers of preschool children and five early childhood teachers through a synchronous online text chat. In the process of consulting the early childhood teachers, the parents expressed many concerns, questions and views of childrearing and early childhood education, thereby providing evidence about their thinking and behaviour. Drawing on the concept of ‘disposition’, the study provides insights into the common thinking threads that characterized Chinese parenting and the ways those threads were woven into their disposed approaches to child rearing and early education...|$|E

Traditionally con icts over issues like growth in com-mercial nature tourism, predator control, forest policies, protected areas management, cultural heritage protection, and rights asso-ciated with common access, have been {{explained in terms of}} opposing values, attitudes, and goals between urban and rural interests.

To examine how a local community and a population of tourists feel about an area we examine data from two separate surveys from the Femundsmarka–Røros region in Southern Nor-way. This region includes a wilderness-type national park and a historic mining town recognised as a World Heritage Site and including a diverse agricultural landscape.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} cooperative and competitive tasks were compared to explore their temporal and spatial dynamics in the brain through electrocortical (EEG) and hemodynamic (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS) measures. Two distinct groups of subjects were submitted to a joint cooperative (experiment 1) or competitive (experiment 2) game {{in the form of}} a sustained attention task. Participants were required to synchronize their behavioral responses in exp 1, and to perform better than the competitor in exp 2, considering both accuracy (Error Rate, ER) and Response Times (RTs). During the experiment subjects constantly received feedbacks about their performance, which was experimentally manipulated. In addition, a personality trait measure (Behavioral Activation System, BAS) was submitted and used to qualify participants according to their rewarding attitude. Also, subjects were required to assess their self-perception of social ranking during the task. Their behavioral performance was calculated to assess the relation between all these different measures. Results showed increased left prefrontal cortical responsiveness in high-BAS participants in case of both cooperation and competition. Moreover, high-BAS participants showed greater left frontal activity during the cooperative task, in parallel with the perception of increased social ranking and better performance. Such results demonstrate that cooperation is related to the highest cortical responsivity within the left prefrontal cortex, especially for high-BAS subjects. This left hemisphere effect, in fact, is related to the individual <b>approach</b> <b>attitude</b> in a way that individuals with higher BAS profiles were more likely to show dominant and proactive attitudes in situations that produce positive and rewarding effects.

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} Ignaz Jan Paderewski’s {{life and career}} {{have been the subject}} of {{previous}} research, but some important areas remain uninvestigated. Moreover, many biographies, especially those written in English, have hitherto rarely adopted a critical stance. My aim here is to examine those elements of Paderewski’s performance style that have not hitherto been fully studied. Unique Polish sources include unpublished letters written to his father and Helena Górska, his secretaries’ letters written in 1935 and between 1938 - 39, and of course his correspondence with his pupils, which sheds considerable new light on his views on, and success in, piano teaching. This dissertation discusses in detail his stylistic <b>approach,</b> <b>attitude</b> towards piano playing, preparation for performance and methods of interpretation. Unpublished letters between Paderewski and his pupils deal with such issues as: choosing concert programmes, techniques of pedalling and advanced interpretational issues. To further evaluate changes in Paderewski’s playing style over his career I have analysed a representative selection of his recordings made over the course of his career. Although Paderewski’s style did not change radically, some of the recorded pieces do demonstrate significant differences in interpretation, and his experiments in phrasing, dynamics, tempo and pedaling. I additionally compare some of the recordings of the same pieces by Paderewski and his contemporaries. For instance, Arthur Friedheim’s recording of Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in C sharp minor. An approach such as this will illuminate, for example, some differences in style between representatives of the ‘Liszt School’ (of which Friedheim was one of the most celebrated exponents) and that of Leschetizky (as represented by Paderewski). This documentation and evaluation of Paderewski’s performance style has naturally influenced my own performances of his works. The accompanying recital therefore includes one of Paderewski’s most substantial piano pieces, the Sonata in E flat minor, contrasted by a Sonata by Paderewski’s contemporary, Sergei Rachmaninov, and completed by works of Chopin in Paderewski’s repertoire, and a piece by his pupil, Ernest Schelling, also recorded by Paderewski. The recital therefore constitutes a practical application of Paderewski’s performance and programming styles as discussed in the dissertation...|$|E
