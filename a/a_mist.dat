5|$|They {{have created}} some dishes and desserts based on {{perfumes}} such as Calvin Klein's Eternity, Carolina Herrera, Lanc√¥me and Bulgari. This {{has resulted in}} a perfume being released by the restaurant itself, called Nuvol de Ilimona. It was based on a dessert served at the restaurant called Lemon Distillation, and was developed to spray as <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> over the diners as they ate the dish. The wine list is split into separate lists for red and white, and is delivered on a trolley to each table.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{awake in}} a prison cell full of bananas, {{confused}} and unaware of how they arrived at their location. A demonic prison guard tells {{them that they are}} in the Nightosphere, the hellish realm ruled by Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson). The two set off to locate Marceline's father and navigate back to their home dimension. Traversing the Nightosphere, Finn and Jake learn that they need to seek an audience with Hunson Abadeer if they want to leave. Eventually, they reach a line composed of demons who seek petitions from their demonic overlord. Just then, a storm cloud appears in <b>a</b> <b>mist,</b> slaying all the demons present; Finn and Jake barely escape death.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, {{determining}} that Wayne is a Czech immigrant {{by the name}} of Ivan Veles, reaches the conclusion that Wayne is a demon who is trying to have a normal baby, and suspects that he terminates pregnancies when the fetus exhibits demon-like traits. Betsy has a dream similar to Laura's, but recognizes the dream-demon as her husband. Nevertheless, she loses her baby and tracks down Mulder and Scully. The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Betsy's backyard. After a short conversation, the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider. He is taken to hospital and placed in a bed next to Laura. <b>A</b> <b>mist</b> passes from Weinsider's body into Laura's, at which point Weinsider dies and Laura recovers.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>misting</b> fan {{is similar}} to a humidifier. A fan blows <b>a</b> fine <b>mist</b> of water into the air. If the air is not too humid, the water evaporates, {{absorbing}} heat from the air, allowing the misting fan to also work as an air cooler. <b>A</b> <b>misting</b> fan may be used outdoors, especially in a dry climate. It may also be used indoors.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a greenhouse {{system with a}} climate regulation which is controlled through measuring the stomatal aperture of the plants present in the greenhouse. The regulation mainly consists of controlling <b>a</b> <b>misting</b> installation and optionally of adjusting other, conventional climate regulating installations in the greenhouse (such as ventilation windows, heating/cooling, screening, etc.). Due to the combination of optimizing the stomatal aperture and the regulation through <b>a</b> <b>misting</b> installation, optimal conditions for the biomass production can be obtained and maintaine...|$|R

5|$|Ninox boobook rotiensis {{is found}} on Rote Island in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was first {{described}} in 1997 by Australian biologists Ronald Johnstone and J.C. Darnell from a female collected in <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> net in 1990. It {{is smaller than}} subspecies boobook, with heavily barred primaries, rump and tail. Locally common, it is known to the local people as Tuterui and Kokorok. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent from the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2000 season, Six Flags New England {{was known}} as Riverside Park. Six Flags {{purchased}} the park and added their own DC Comics theming. The site that Superman the Ride operates on is the former site of the Riverside Park Speedway. The Speedway was demolished after the 1999 season {{to make room for}} a new themed area, DC Superhero Adventure. As part of the $40 million expansion, the park built Superman: Ride of Steel. Six Flags worked with Swiss manufacturer, Intamin, to build and design the ride a year earlier. The final track piece of Superman was installed on March 27, 2000, about 40 days before opening day. The ride officially opened on May 5, 2000 as the tallest and longest roller coaster on the East Coast of the United States. The entrance and station were themed to Superman with Superman logos and a picture of him located above the entrance. The second tunnel also had <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{infantry}} brigade of 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{which had}} reached Beit Likia on 19 November by moving along a track {{north of the}} main road, was held up towards Kuryet el Enab by a very determined and formidable Ottoman rearguard armed with machine guns at Kustal and Beit Dukka. The Ottoman positions were strongly defended and the 52nd (Lowland) Division could not advance until <b>a</b> <b>mist,</b> rolled down just before dark on 21 November, giving the 75th Division the opportunity to rapidly deploy, climb the ridge, and defeat the Ottoman force with bayonets. That night, the troops ate their iron rations (carried by the men as emergency rations), and some found shelter from the miserable conditions in a large monastery and sanatorium. The night was cold with heavy rain, and those without shelter suffered severely. No supplies arrived till noon the following day owing to congestion on the narrow tracks.|$|E

50|$|An outdoor facility, all runs {{are made}} of matting that is {{suitable}} for use all year round, and floodlighting allows the slopes {{to be used in}} the evenings. <b>A</b> <b>misting</b> system ensures the slopes remain lubricated to increase speed and to create a more realistic surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{general term}} {{nebulizer}} {{refers to an}} apparatus that converts liquids into <b>a</b> fine <b>mist.</b> Nozzles also convert liquids into <b>a</b> fine <b>mist,</b> but do so by pressure through small holes. Nebulizers generally use gas flows to deliver the mist. The {{most common form of}} nebulizers are medical appliances such as asthma inhalers or paint spray cans. Analytical nebulizers are a special category in that their purpose is to deliver <b>a</b> fine <b>mist</b> to spectrometric instruments for elemental analysis. They are necessary parts of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).|$|R

25|$|Numerous waterfalls and caves are {{scattered}} across the island, including MagAso Falls in Antequera. MagAso means smoke in the native tongue. The water is cool and often creates <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> in humid mornings which can hide the falls.|$|E
25|$|HI is a colorless {{gas that}} reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. With moist air, HI gives <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> (or fumes) of hydroiodic acid. It is {{exceptionally}} soluble in water, giving hydroiodic acid. One liter of water will dissolve 425 liters of HI, the most concentrated solution having only four water molecules per molecule of HI.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the mining}} {{establishment}} of Delamar Ghost Town, Nevada was ruined by a dry-mining process {{that produced a}} silicosis-causing dust. After hundreds of deaths from silicosis, the town was nicknamed The Widowmaker. The problem {{in those days was}} somewhat resolved with an addition of a nozzle to the drill which sprayed <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> of water, turning dust raised by drilling into mud, but this inhibited mining work.|$|E
25|$|The {{average annual}} {{precipitation}} is 1509.1mm. During the cooler winter months rainfall is at a minimum, with Xalapa receiving only 42 millimetes in January and 38 millimetres in February on average. Snow, however, {{is common in}} winter outside the city at Perote, located around 35 minutes from Xalapa. Very early in the morning, Xalapa often has <b>a</b> <b>mist,</b> giving it a characteristic mountain atmosphere. The greatest rainfall occurs during the summer months, particularly in June, when on average rainfall reaches 328 millimetres, remaining relatively high until mid-September.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 Cochrane {{systematic}} review looking at data from four trials on topical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene therapy {{does not support}} its clinical use as <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> inhaled into the lungs to treat cystic fibrosis patients with lung infections. One of the four trials did find weak evidence that liposome-based CFTR gene transfer therapy {{may lead to a}} small respiratory improvement for people with CF. This weak evidence is not enough to make a clinical recommendation for routine CFTR gene therapy.|$|E

50|$|Australian Mists are {{medium-sized}} short-haired cats, with a {{round head}} and large eyes. The coat is very short and lacks <b>an</b> undercoat. Australian <b>Mists</b> do not require much brushing because they lose little hair. The coat patterns have three aspects: the ground colour, which is paler than the pattern; the pattern; {{and the appearance of}} wearing <b>a</b> <b>misted</b> veil, caused by random ticking in the solid colour areas. The legs and tail are ringed or barred, and the face and neck also have lines of colour. Their life expectancy is 15-18 years.|$|R
25|$|Ambient air, of course, was the {{original}} machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net {{result is that the}} heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> (mist coolant systems, described above).|$|E
25|$|Phage therapy‚Äîviruses that {{specifically}} target pathogenic bacteria‚Äîhas been {{developed over the}} last 80 years, primarily in the former Soviet Union, where {{it was used to}} prevent diarrhea caused by E. coli. Presently, phage therapy for humans is available only at the Phage Therapy Center in the Republic of Georgia and in Poland. However, on January 2, 2007, the United States FDA gave Omnilytics approval to apply its E. coli O157:H7 killing phage in <b>a</b> <b>mist,</b> spray or wash on live animals that will be slaughtered for human consumption.|$|E

They inform H√∂√∞r that Baldr {{witnessed}} Nanna bathing, yet warn H√∂√∞r not to challenge Baldr to combat‚Äîno matter what he may do‚Äîfor Baldr sprang from divine seed and is therefore a demi-god. The maidens and their dwelling vanish and H√∂√∞r finds himself standing in a wide open plain. Saxo explains that H√∂√∞r had been tricked by means of magic.|$|E

25|$|Female smokers in film {{were also}} early on {{associated}} with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality, most notably personified by German film star Marlene Dietrich. Similarly, actors like Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn have been closely identified with their smoker persona, {{and some of their}} most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> of cigarette smoke. Hepburn often enhanced the glamor with a cigarette holder, most notably in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship, as two cigarettes burning unattended in an ashtray were often used to suggest sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|For the 2011 MY, the XRS and XLE {{grades were}} {{discontinued}} for the US market (XRS is still available in Canada). The revised Corolla features new {{front and rear}} exterior styling and interior design changes, including a redesigned front grille, front and rear bumpers, new wheel designs, rear chrome garnish, rear combination lamps and trunk lid. The interior adds a metallic trim (LE and S grades), new fabrics and a sport tilt/telescopic steering wheel (S grade). Corolla also features two new colors, Nautical Blue Metallic and Sandy Beach Metallic. New standard features for the LE grade include cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, two additional audio speakers, and variable intermittent windshield wipers with <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> cycle. The S grade adds standard cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, 16-inch alloy wheels and a color-keyed rear deck spoiler.|$|E
25|$|When Parke did {{not receive}} a {{favorable}} reply to his request for cancellation of the assault, he prepared to send 18 regiments forward. Brigadier General Robert B. Potter's division was {{to the west of}} the Jerusalem Plank Road. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) John F. Hartranft's division, covered by three regiments of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Orlando B. Willcox's division, was to the east on the right of Fort Sedgwick. Parke's attackers moved forward into <b>a</b> <b>mist</b> at about 4:00a.m. Thomas P. Beals, with three companies of the 31st Maine Infantry Regiment, led the attack of Potter's division on Battery No. 28 and under artillery fire from the secondary Confederate line, moved along the main line toward Fort Mahone. Hartranft's division had similar success taking Battery No. 27. Harriman's three regiments from Willcox's division took five guns and 68 prisoners at Battery No. 25. The Union attackers captured Miller's salient but then had to fight Confederate defenders from traverse to traverse along the trenches.|$|E
