25|$|I {{should make}} it clear that we do not accept that Britain has a special {{responsibility}} to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. We are a new government from diverse backgrounds without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we were colonised, not colonisers.|$|E
500|$|... "Desperate Souls" [...] partly {{deals with}} the {{aftermath}} of Sheriff Graham's death from the previous episode. Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, [...] "You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
6000|$|... "'The same, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>know,</b> his boasting about maltreating policemen whom {{he never}} saw led to his being sentenced to nine months in gaol lately." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Sir, {{during last}} summer, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are aware, {{it came to}} my {{knowledge}} that whilst holding the fiduciary position of vice-chairman of the Yorkshire College you were illegally <b>and</b> improperly, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> making profit <b>as</b> its paid solicitor.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother, {{say nothing}} about it {{one way or the}} other, to anybody. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> now <b>know</b> how the matter stands, it's no good any of us talking more about it till I've settled what I mean to do myself." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the visit, [...] "ideas and {{thoughts}} about closer cooperation between India and USSR were expressed. Now, after India wins independence, {{they have got}} its own real implementation. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> there are friendly and mutually-understanding relationships today between both our countries".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2008, Fincher {{stated the}} movie is {{unlikely}} to be made. [...] "It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've been trying to do it but it's probably not going to happen." [...] However, in 2010 it was announced that the film was still planned for future production and both Freeman and Fincher mentioned it as still needing a worthy script.|$|E
2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all we started out and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it was our first album. But import copies got in <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs {{and so we had}} a gay audience, {{a lot of people who}} were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In which I {{resemble}} your grandfather," [...] I said, [...] "for I, too, {{have read}} more even than naval officers {{are supposed to}} read, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> men <b>know,</b> we are permitted a greater latitude {{in the study of}} geography and history than men of other professions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you ever}} breathe a word {{of what you have}} seen or heard, or what you think you have seen or heard to-day, to any one, I will set my father at <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> will mean {{roasting}} alive over a slow fire at the very least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Mark. I always speak first <b>and</b> think afterwards, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{pretty well}} by this time. Well, {{what sort of}} lodgings do you want?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{track is}} an up-tempo {{composition}} featuring funk production and go-go elements. It is composed {{in the key}} of D#minor and moves at a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. Set in common time, [...] "Work" [...] is written in the common verse-chorus form. The singer has described the song as [...] "actually very innocent [...] a little aggressive maybe:" [...] "All I'm saying is don't come around if you're {{not going to live}} up to all your talk <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> some guys are just full of talk," [...] Rowland said in a 2008 interview with Popjustice. [...] "It's just a woman saying you can't catch me easy and you have to put in the work. It's about putting in work – that's it, of course." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 November 1997, Short sent {{a letter}} to Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Agriculture in Zimbabwe, in which she stated that [...] "we do not accept that Britain has a special {{responsibility}} to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe." [...] She went on to write [...] "We are a new government from diverse backgrounds, without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we were colonised, not colonisers." [...] In the same letter she did, however, offer qualified support for land reform: [...] "We do recognise the very real issues you face over land reform... we would be prepared to support a programme of land reform that was part of a poverty eradication strategy, but not on any other basis." [...] This letter caused a rift with the Zimbabwean government, which asserted that the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 had contained a continuing pledge from the United Kingdom government to assist in land reform.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a debate}} for Governor of Alaska in 2006, Palin {{said she was}} a proponent of {{teaching}} both creationism and evolution in the Alaska public schools. The following day she said: [...] "It doesn't have {{to be part of the}} curriculum", and that she would not push to have it added. She also said she would not use religion or views on creationism as a litmus test in picking members of the Alaska Board of Education. (Under state law, the Board of Education determines the content of the public schools' curriculum.) Palin has also said that evolution [...] "should be taught as an accepted principle. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher, a science teacher, who has really instilled in me a respect for science. It should be taught in our schools. And I won't deny that I see the hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth. But that is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district. Science should be taught in science class." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Marriage is {{impossible}} {{from the family}} <b>and</b> also, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the financial point of view. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> my feelings towards you, so I need not say anything about that. Without money we must come to grief. I know I was very wrong in letting you believe it was possible, but my nerves were very tried with your several illnesses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you were}} younger then," [...] Home laughed. [...] "You have passed {{eighteen}} now, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> yourself, {{are by no}} means bad looking, with a certain air of freshness and simplicity that is so rare here in Paris that it will be regarded <b>as</b> refreshing <b>and</b> delightful after the flippancies of the court gallants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{he seems}} changed, in some way, Donald. Not so nervous <b>and</b> wild <b>as</b> usual, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> I've just left him drawing a picture. Curious. A good picture, too." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order they were going to go in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} could depend on him, sir; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> a good many others in this country follow vocations they were never {{intended}} for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly," [...] Duncombe answered. [...] "The {{advice you}} gave me before was, I know, good. It was {{confirmed}} a few hours following, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I followed it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] {{the general}} said, {{when he had}} finished. [...] "Your {{calculations}} were all well founded; but, of course, you could not calculate on Soult's night march across the Catalena hills, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> nothing of the whereabouts of Beresford and Silveira, you {{had good reason to}} suppose that Soult would continue his march up the valley of the Tamega to Chaves. That was the only mistake you committed, and an older soldier might well have fallen into the same error. When you had found out your mistake, you acted promptly, and could not have done better than to proceed to Salamende. You did well to destroy both bridges, and to place half your force to defend the passage here, for <b>you</b> naturally supposed, <b>as</b> I supposed myself, that Soult would follow this road down to Chaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] added Mrs. Gardiner, [...] "that no {{consideration}} {{with regard}} to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> well <b>know,</b> we go out so little, {{that it is very}} improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song makes notable {{mention of}} the Birdland jazz club in New York City in its opening line - [...] "Ladies <b>and</b> gentlemen, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we have {{something}} special down here at Birdland this evening: a recording for Blue Note Records." [...] The line, spoken by Pee Wee Marquette, is taken from Art Blakey's first Birdland album, A Night at Birdland Vol. 1.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{one knows}} the river better, Hiram; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I would have given you the command of a steamer long ago if you would have taken it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Whatever {{you wish}} to do to-day must be done quickly,” said Captain Sanders. “It will soon be night, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{darkness}} comes on quickly {{in this part of}} the world.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{promised that}} it should be sent, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> it was. Then I sent the others out of the room, and inquired about his hurt. He set his lips firm, and shook his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mary," [...] Martha said, smiling, [...] "John and you {{are both}} mortal; and {{although}} you may truly love each other--and will, I trust, be very happy <b>as</b> husband <b>and</b> wife--subjects will occur upon which you will differ; <b>and</b> then, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the wisest plan is for the wife to be silent. It is the wife's duty always {{to give way to}} the husband." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the ground}} where the brave Harold fell, William the Norman {{afterwards}} founded an abbey, which, {{under the name of}} Battle Abbey, was a rich and splendid place through many a troubled year, though now it is a grey ruin overgrown with ivy. But the first work he had to do, was to conquer the English thoroughly; <b>and</b> that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> by this time, was hard work for any man.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is another}} contingency," [...] the Russian remarked, [...] "which, {{now we are}} upon the subject, it would perhaps be as well to allude to. The {{relations}} between Germany <b>and</b> England, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> just now are very sorely strained. If Germany should {{take advantage of the}} present situation to make a demonstration against England, that, of course, would not, from your point of view, affect the situation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am troubled indeed," [...] he said, {{in answer}} to Beric's inquiry. [...] "Lesbia has been proposing to me the {{marriage}} of Rufinus Sulla, a connection of hers, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> one of Nero's intimates, with Aemilia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't. It {{was not in}} any way wonderful. My {{father was}} absent when Mr. Boone brought me the news, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I am {{responsible}} for the prosperity of Bonaventure in his absence. Our cattle were in jeopardy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't private," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{particularly}} want Mr. Fenn {{to tell me}} something, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> he is peculiar. Perhaps, if {{you don't}} mind, {{it would be better}} if you waited for me downstairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord bless you, sir, Madam Willoughby had his honour {{carried into}} her own room, and there she and Miss Beulah"--so all of the Hut still called the wife of Evert Beekman--"she and Miss Beulah, kneel, and pray, <b>and</b> weep, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> sir, ladies will, {{whenever}} anything severe comes over their feelings--God bless them both, we all say, and think, ay, and pray, too, in our turns, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said he, [...] "you saw me {{postponed}} {{for future}} consideration. You promised you would regard everything <b>you</b> heard <b>as</b> confidential; {{by so doing}} you enabled me to speak when otherwise I might not have dared to do so. I am deeply grateful to you; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> already <b>know</b> so much about my hopes and my aspirations, I think it right <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> {{all there is to}} know." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Turner {{summarised}} the album's title as:"The {{three things}} you need in life to be content. Love, ire - righteous anger - <b>and</b> song, <b>as</b> in, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> like a guitar and some Gram Parsons tunes." ...|$|R
