40|$|Objectives Hemoptysis is an {{alarming}} symptom of underlying lung disease. Clinicians are often unsure {{how to deal}} with and follow up patients who have had <b>a</b> single <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis, especially if the cause remains unknown despite thorough examination, because a second, more severe <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis might occur despite an apparently stable condition. Investigations were done, using multivariate analyses, to see whether several clinical factors present during <b>an</b> initial <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis could be used to predict <b>a</b> second <b>episode.</b> Subjects and Methods Eighty patients with <b>an</b> initial <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis who underwent both computed tomographic and bronchoscopic examinations from 2003 through 2005 were reviewed. Results The isolation of bacteria from bronchial lavage fluid (odds ratio 13. 5, P = 0. 001) and the failure to determine the cause <b>of</b> the initial <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis (odds ratio 7. 0, P = 0. 014) were significant independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis. Subset analysis showed that isolation of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Haemophilus influenzae increased the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis (P = 0. 077), even if colonization, representing host-bacterial equilibrium, had occurred. Furthermore, the failure to determine the etiology <b>of</b> <b>an</b> initial <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> massive second <b>episode</b> (P = 0. 042), regardless of the volume <b>of</b> the initial <b>episode.</b> Conclusions In patients with bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract or <b>an</b> initial <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis of unknown etiology, there is an increased possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> hemoptysis...|$|R
