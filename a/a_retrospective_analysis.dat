25|$|Hartelius, Caplan and Rardin {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{definitions of}} transpersonal psychology. They found three dominant themes {{that define the}} field: beyond-ego psychology, integrative/holistic psychology, and psychology of transformation. Analysis suggested that the field has moved from an early emphasis on alternative states of consciousness to a more expanded view of human wholeness and transformation. This development has, according to the authors, moved the field closer to the integral approaches of Ken Wilber and Post-Aurobindonian theorists.|$|E
25|$|Through <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{national}} administrative data, {{the association between}} mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This “weekday effect” has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{estimate}} that 2-5% {{of those with}} peripheral nerve injury, and 13-70 percent of those with hemiplegia (paralysis of {{one side of the}} body), will develop CRPS. In addition, some studies have indicated that cigarette smoking was strikingly present in patients and is statistically linked to RSD. This may be involved in its pathology by enhancing sympathetic activity, vasoconstriction, or by some other unknown neurotransmitter-related mechanism. This hypothesis was based on <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of 53 patients with RSD, which showed that 68% of patients and only 37% of controls were smokers. The results are preliminary and are limited by their retrospective nature. 7% of people who have CRPS in one limb later develop it in another limb.|$|E

25|$|No new {{guidelines}} dealing specifically with HPV+OPC have yet been developed, outside of clinical trials. Indirect data suggests {{the efficacy of}} less intense treatment. <b>A</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of advanced (N+) HPV+OPC suggested 96% 5 year local control with deintensified radiation of 54Gy and concurrent cisplatin based chemotherapy. The conclusions of the above pair of similar phase II trials have been supported by several other phase II trials. A prospective trial (ECOG 1308) demonstrated similar locoregional control with 54Gy., and another study, a high pathological complete response rate at 60Gy. These studies all used well below the previous standard dose of 70Gy. Since long term toxicity is associated with radiation dose, determining the efficacy of lower and hence less morbid doses of radiation is a priority, since many HPV+ patients {{can be expected to}} have long term survival.|$|E
25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (low, intermediate, and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation. Even if recurrence or metastases occur, HPV positivity still confers an advantage.|$|E

500|$|To {{measure the}} true effects of any traffic {{management}} scheme it is normally necessary {{to establish a}} baseline, or [...] "do nothing" [...] case, which estimates the effects on the network without any changes other than normal trends and expected local changes.

Regardless of the scheme's impact, in <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> Transport for London (TfL) estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing highway capacity. In 2006, the last year before the zone was expanded, TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year, while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year.|$|E
