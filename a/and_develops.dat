5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes <b>and</b> <b>develops</b> through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit <b>and</b> <b>develops</b> due to {{blockages}} in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E

The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E

40|$|Concerns that (1) {{growth in}} {{developing}} countries could worsen the US terms of trade and (2) that increased US trade with developing countries will increase US wage inequality both implicitly reflect the assumption that goods produced in the United States <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are close substitutes and that specialization is incomplete. In this paper we show on the contrary that there are distinctive patterns of international specialization <b>and</b> that <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries export fundamentally different products, especially those classified as high tech. Judged by export shares, the United States <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries specialize in quite different product categories that, for the most part, do not overlap. Moreover, even when exports are classified in the same category, there are large and systematic differences in unit values that suggest the products made by <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are not very close substitutes—developed country products are far more sophisticated. This generalization is already recognized in the literature {{but it does not}} hold for all types of products. Export unit values of <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries of primary commodity–intensive products are typically quite similar. Unit values of standardized (low-tech) manufactured products exported by <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are somewhat similar. By contrast, the medium- and high-tech manufactured exports of <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries differ greatly. This finding has important implications.

5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code <b>and</b> <b>develops</b> a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, <b>and</b> <b>develops</b> into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
