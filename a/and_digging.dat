5|$|Almost {{a million}} slaves in French West Africa {{responded to this}} by moving away from their masters and {{settling}} elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.|$|E
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects <b>and</b> <b>digging.</b> Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because of the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg's work {{and because of the}} thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) <b>and</b> <b>Digging</b> for Fire.|$|E

5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|Mining was {{challenging}} as the ore {{was distributed}} in an uneven manner <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> was made slow by permafrost. As a result, some miners chose {{to buy and}} sell claims, building up huge investments and letting others do the work. To accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang up along the routes and at their end Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon River. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house around 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. Despite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly gambling and drinking in the saloons. The Native Hän people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush, being moved into a reserve {{to make way for the}} stampeders, and many died.|$|E
5|$|Manco Inca had {{gathered}} more than 30,000troops at Ollantaytambo, among them, {{a large number}} of recruits from tribes of the Amazon Rainforest. Manco Inca's forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training. This was the regular fare in the Inca Empire, where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old. In combat, these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders, called kurakas. They used melee weapons such as maces, clubs and spears as well as ranged weapons such as arrows, javelins, and slings; protective gear included helmets, shields, and quilted cloth armor. Against the conquistadors, wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate Spanish armor; slings and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and the large size of their projectiles. Even so, Inca soldiers were no match for the Spanish cavalry in open terrain so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> pits in open fields to hinder the mobility of horses.|$|E

25|$|The {{policy of}} Dhamma also {{included}} other welfare measures, like the planting of trees <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> of wells. Ashoka attacked ceremonies and sacrifices as meaningless.

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{there were}} harsh {{reprisals}} against Franco's former enemies. Thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and at least 30,000 executed. Other estimates of these deaths range from 50,000 to 200,000, depending on which deaths are included. Many others were put to forced labour, building railways, draining swamps, <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> canals.|$|E

25|$|The {{robotic arm}} was a {{critical}} part of the Phoenix Mars mission. On May 28, scientists leading the mission sent commands to unstow its robotic arm and take more images of its landing site.

25|$|The first Olympic festival was {{organized}} {{on the site}} by the authorities of Elis in the 8th century BC – with tradition dating the first games at 776 BC. Major changes {{were made to the}} site around 700 BC, including levelling land <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> new wells. Elis' power diminished and the sanctuary fell {{into the hands of the}} Pisatans in 676 BC. The Pisatans organized the games until the late 7th century BC.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} in 1905 when the French issued a formal decree ending slavery throughout French West Africa, including {{the area to}} become the country of Mali. Throughout French West Africa almost a million slaves responded to this by moving away from their masters and settling elsewhere, with the French supporting this effort by creating settlements around the Niger River <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> wells for communities elsewhere to engage in agriculture away from their former masters.|$|E
25|$|The Atfalati {{band of the}} Kalapuya people, {{who were}} the first {{inhabitants}} of the area, hunted and gathered in the area including hunting waterfowl <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> up camas roots. Then when European pioneers settled the area beginning in the 1830s farms were established in the area, with the wetlands area usually not being used due to the annual flooding. However, bridges were built across the river and steamboats plied the river before the railroads came to the valley.|$|E

25|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to advance methods of {{improvisation}} and active listening, proposing live audio soundscapes that mesh canine sounds with electroacoustic practice. In {{the process of developing}} this performance, a custom built theremin, that incorporates a rug as an interface, was created to allow Tom to use scratch <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> gestures to create sound, accompanied by a diverse range of vocalization. These studio performances are audio recorded for use later in the live performance where they are remixed into a new experimental improvisational soundscape. Andreyev accompanies Tom's vocals and rhythms with her own live theremin and software performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{seal and}} {{search of the}} village had started on June 1. While {{the rest of the}} {{division}} was preparing night patrols, selecting outpost locations, <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> in to overnight defensive positions, Major Henry J. Wereszynski's 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry, was conducting an airmobile assault to set up a cordon around the village of Tân Phước Khánh and its 9,000 inhabitants. A combined force of five companies had been formed to cordon the village. Major Wereszynski had Companies A, B, and C with Troop A, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, attached and the 7th Company, 7th ARVN Regiment of the 5th Division.|$|E
25|$|Marduk-apla-iddina {{attempted}} {{to flee to}} Elam but the king forbade him entry. Taking hostages from Ur, Uruk, and other towns, {{he went to his}} ancestral city of Dūr-Jakin which he further fortified by adding to the walls <b>and</b> <b>digging</b> a canal from the Euphrates to flood the surrounding area. In 709 BC Sargon's troops gained a victory outside the city but could not take Dūr-Jakin, where Marduk-apla-iddina had fled. A negotiated settlement was reached whereby Sargon would spare Marduk-apla-iddina's life provided the city walls were demolished. It is not clear whether they were, since two years later, Sargon returned to take them down himself.|$|E
