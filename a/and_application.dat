40|$|Mobile Commerce is an {{evolving}} area of e-Commerce, where users can {{interact with the}} service providers through a mobile and wireless network, using mobile devices for information retrieval and transaction processing. M-Commerce services <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> can be adopted through different wireless and mobile networks, {{with the aid of}} several mobile devices. However, constraints of both mobile networks and devices influence their operational performance; therefore, there is a strong need for taking into consideration those constraints in the design and development phases of m-Commerce services <b>and</b> <b>applications.</b> Another important factor in designing m-Commerce services <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> is the identification of mobile users requirements. Furthermore, m-Commerce services <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> need to be classified based on the functionality they provide to the mobile users. This kind of classification results in two major classes: the directory and the transaction-oriented services <b>and</b> <b>applications.</b> This paper suggests a new approach for designing and developing m-Commerce services <b>and</b> <b>applications.</b> This approach relies on mobile users needs and requirements, the classification of the m-Commerce services <b>and</b> <b>applications,</b> as well as the current technologies for mobile and wireless computing and their constraints. Key Words: m-Commerce, mobile network, mobile user requirements, mobile services <b>and</b> <b>applications.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{ytterbium}} +3 ion {{is used as}} a {{doping material}} in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient, have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses; ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser. Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1.06–1.12µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm–1µm, dependently on the host <b>and</b> <b>application.</b> The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling.|$|E

In addition to power transmission technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E
