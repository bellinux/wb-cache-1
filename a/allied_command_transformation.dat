5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial activities, Hampton Roads {{is a major}} military center, particularly for the United States Navy, and Norfolk serves as the home for Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval installation. Located on Sewell's Point Peninsula, in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, the station is the headquarters of the United States Fleet Forces Command (formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet), which compromises over 62,000 active duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircraft. The base also serves as the headquarters to NATO's <b>Allied</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Transformation.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between <b>Allied</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Transformation</b> (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.|$|E
5|$|New NATO {{structures}} were also formed while old ones were abolished. In 1997, NATO reached {{agreement on a}} significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to just 20. The NATO Response Force (NRF) was launched at the 2002 Prague summit on 21November, the first summit in a former Comecon country. On 19June 2003, a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, <b>Allied</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Transformation</b> (ACT), was established in Norfolk, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of Allied Command Operations (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO, whilst ACO is responsible for current operations. In March 2004, NATO's Baltic Air Policing began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia by providing jet fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions. Eight multinational jet fighters are based in Lithuania, the number of which was increased from four in 2014. Also at the 2004 Istanbul summit, NATO launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with four Persian Gulf nations.|$|E
50|$|With this {{increased}} operational focus, there remains the critical element of promoting enhanced interoperability and standardization through provisions of land advice and guidance within <b>Allied</b> <b>Command</b> for Operations. Headquarters will also {{work closely with}} <b>Allied</b> <b>Command</b> for <b>Transformation</b> on aspects such as land concept development, exercises and training.
