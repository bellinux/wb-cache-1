Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage, but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge. He recalls his wedding reception, which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop. Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge, but they only serve to annoy her.|$|E

500|$|According to Bollywood Hungama, after {{establishing}} {{a reputation for}} portraying neurotic characters, Ranaut was seeking projects that would be [...] "less emotionally exhausting" [...] for her. Her first release of 2011 was Anand L. Rai's Tanu Weds Manu, a romantic comedy opposite R. Madhavan, which Ranaut considers a [...] "game changer" [...] for her. Rai stated that he cast her for the role to illustrate that the actress was capable of playing other roles and that her character in the film was unlike any of those that she had played previously. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, though Ranaut's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Kangana Ranaut is a pleasant surprise in <b>a</b> <b>cheery,</b> upbeat part that we haven't seen her take on before. She rises to the challenge, only hampered occasionally by her mangled dialogue delivery." [...] Ranaut received Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Screen and Zee Cine.|$|E
500|$|At a {{time when}} the Yorkshire team was {{successful}} but exhibited a grim and determined attitude, Kilner was very popular with spectators. They liked him for his cheerfulness and desire to entertain, an attitude not shared by all of his team-mates. He had many friends in the game at {{a time when}} Yorkshire were not always welcome in other counties due to their on-field attitude. When he was chosen as a Bowler of the Year in 1924, Wisden remarked that he was devoted to the game, possessed <b>a</b> <b>cheery</b> temperament and stood out among players for his personality, while his obituary described him as modest and generous. His Times obituary described him as [...] "not only a notable exponent of the game, but a man of rare charm. Few modern professionals commanded such a measure of esteem and kindly regard from his own immediate colleagues and his opponents in the cricket field as did Roy Kilner".|$|E

500|$|Hill {{was a man}} of high {{ideals and}} was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his {{pleasant}} nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him as honest, direct and without guile. [...] An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. [...] The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to see, so Hill then asked Bardsley, [...] "Did you catch it?" [...] When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911–12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. [...] Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was <b>a</b> <b>cheery</b> skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. [...] When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who had to remind Hill that the record was previously his.|$|E
500|$|By {{the fifth}} orbit, Schirra {{had begun to}} relax, commenting {{that it was the}} first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small bungee cord {{exercise}} device for [...] "a little bit of stretching", before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on [...] "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made some comments on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with <b>a</b> <b>cheery</b> [...] "Buenos Dias, y'all!" [...] Schirra later noted that he was [...] "furious" [...] at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.|$|E

Although she is initially pleased {{with the results of}} her meddling, Leslie soon realizes Tammy is using sex to manipulate Ron to give her control of Lot 48. Leslie confronts Tammy, who admits to the plot and brags that this is how the library operates. Leslie tries to get Ron to break up with Tammy, but he insists he cannot confront her without Leslie's help. The two go to the library, where Ron starts to cave in when Tammy flirts with him. Leslie tells Ron to do whatever will make him happy, even if it means giving up the lot. Ron, impressed that anyone would put his own needs before their own, decides instead to break up with Tammy and give the lot back to Leslie. After breaking the news to Tammy off-camera, he leaves the library with a push-pin stuck in his forehead, and part of his mustache missing, and he and Leslie flee the library. The two share a drink, where Leslie encourages Ron to insult Tammy.|$|E

5000|$|In 1927 he {{published}} The Dark Chamber, arguably {{his most famous}} work. The novel was described by H.P. Lovecraft in his Supernatural Horror in Literature as [...] "extremely high in artistic stature". [...] A review proclaimed, [...] "he has opened a squamous dungeon {{of the mind and}} explored it with the erudite perversity of <b>a</b> <b>cheerier,</b> juicier Poe. Like all horror stories it is belittled by its own theatricality yet it remains an amazingly worded orgy of the more unspeakable human propensities." ...|$|R

500|$|The film {{did receive}} some criticism. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent gave the film a mixed review, writing: [...] "On the one hand, Saving Mr. Banks (which was {{developed}} by BBC Films and has a British producer) is a probing, insightful character study with a very dark undertow. On the other, it is <b>a</b> <b>cheery,</b> upbeat marketing exercise in which the Disney organization is re-promoting {{one of its most}} popular film characters." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concluded that if the film [...] ""were 100 percent false and yet felt true, that would be fine. But this has the self-conscious whiff, if not of mendacity, then of public relations." [...] Lou Lumenick of The New York Post criticized the accuracy of the film's events, concluding that [...] "Saving Mr. Banks is ultimately much less about magic than making the sale, in more ways than one." [...] American history lecturer John Wills praised the film's attention to detail, such as the inclusion of Travers' original recordings, but doubted that the interpersonal relations between Travers and Disney were as amicable as portrayed in the film. Landon Palmer of Film School Rejects also described several moments where the film had a [...] "shrewd consumption of [...] own criticisms", only to later negate them and Disney-fy Travers as a character.|$|E

2500|$|Writing {{began in}} December 1976, with a first draft {{completed}} by mid-1977. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following [...] "a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados". The film {{would not have}} been made without Python fan former Beatle George Harrison, who set up HandMade Films to help fund it at a cost of £3million. Harrison put up the money for it as he [...] "wanted to see the movie" [...] (this was later described by Terry Jones as the [...] "world's most expensive cinema ticket"). The original backers, EMI Films, had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter, particularly Bernard Delfont. The very last words in the film are: [...] "I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, [...] "They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally." [...] As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, [...] "owner of the Mount", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:09 in the film). His one word of dialogue (<b>a</b> <b>cheery</b> but out of place Scouse [...] "'ullo") had to be dubbed in later.|$|E
2500|$|Music {{critics have}} been divided on [...] "Dance Again". Kate Callahan from MTV.com {{pointed out the}} {{similarities}} between [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "On The Floor"—"The song is a fun dance pop track with a great beat, very much {{along the lines of}} their 2011 collaborative effort 'On The Floor'." [...] Callahan said that the formats of the two songs were very alike, but also added that as the title implies, the song is danceable, despite not being her most original song. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust gave the song a mixed review, stating [...] " [...] means “Dance Again” doesn’t have any of that swoon or allure, let alone one unifying riff, and it means that right before every verse-to-prechorus or prechorus-to-verse transition, you’re imagining the “la-lalalala...” chorus that doesn’t break out. What breaks out instead is the stately dance-pop that makes up the rest of “On the Floor,” more polite than pressing even when it’s even clearer that the metaphor here is dancing-as-sex." [...] Robbie Daw of the website Idolator gave the song a positive review, writing that it was far more superior and much more euphoric dance-pop offering than [...] "On the Floor". Daw added that [...] "the American Idol judge goes for more of <b>a</b> <b>cheery,</b> almost Kylie Minogue-esque dance-pop vibe with “Dance Again”. If we were gamblers, we’d put our money on this becoming another huge hit for J.Lo & Co." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Le Petit Parisien, Reichelt's initial {{attempt to}} ascend {{to the first}} stage of the tower was blocked by a guard, M. Gassion, who had {{witnessed}} previous unsuccessful dummy drops and feared that Reichelt's attempt would end in disaster, though Le Figaro reported that he had merely not received a copy of the order and had to wait for telephone confirmation from his superiors. Despite the guard's resistance, by 8:00a.m. the matter had been resolved: Reichelt, who was visibly shaken by his argument with the guard, was allowed to mount the tower with his two friends and a cinematographer (another was stationed near the foot of the tower to record the jump from below). As he climbed the stairs he paused, turned back to the crowd, raised his hand and wished them <b>a</b> <b>cheery</b> [...] "". (See you soon). His friends continued to try {{to talk him out of}} the jump, but Reichelt was quite determined. At 8:22a.m., observed by a crowd of about 30 journalists and curious onlookers, he readied himself – facing towards the Seine – on a stool placed on a restaurant table next to the interior guardrail of the tower's first deck, a little more than [...] above the ground. After adjusting his apparatus with the assistance of his friends and checking the wind direction by throwing a piece of paper taken from a small book, he placed one foot on the guardrail, hesitated for about 40 seconds, then leapt outwards. According to Le Figaro, he was calm and smiling just before he jumped. His parachute, which had seemed to be only half-open, folded around him almost immediately and he plummeted for a few seconds before crashing into the frozen soil at the foot of the tower.|$|E
