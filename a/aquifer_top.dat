40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{simplified}} analytical solution {{to determine the}} primary consolidation settlement of a confined sand aquifer overlain by a clay layer due to single well dewatering. After single well pumping in a steady state, the Dupuit equation predicts the confined sand aquifer water head drawdown. The confining pressure on the underlain confined sand <b>aquifer</b> <b>top</b> surface is determined using the principle of vertical force equilibrium. Additional vertical stresses in each layer of the confined sand aquifer are then computed with the Boussinesq solution. The overall aquifer consolidation deformation is then determined with the e-lgp curve from the one-dimensional consolidation test and the applied vertical stress with the integral method. The proposed analytical solution is validated using the ADINA software, where porous media are simulated with the Biot model and solved with the 3 D finite element method. This proposed analytical solution is used to simulate the primary consolidation settlement due to well pumping, using the fourth confined aquifer in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai from 1980 to 1995 as a case study. The predicted settlement compares reasonably well with the actual measured settlement in Shanghai...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{framework}} for certifying and decommissioning CO 2 geologic sequestration sites {{is a critical}} requirement for large-scale deployment of CO 2 sequestration in brine formations. The certification process should account for the sequestration efficiency of a given volume of a saline aquifer. The sequestration efficiency is determined by maximizing CO 2 trapping while minimizing the leakage risk. As part {{of the development of}} the Certification Framework, we carried out a large number of compositional simulations to quantify the effect of various reservoir and operating parameters. Porosity, horizontal permeability, permeability anisotropy, formation thickness and dip, pressure, and temperature were systematically varied. Operating parameters such as injection rate, vertical vs. horizontal well and perforation interval were investigated. We then developed several simplified models of CO 2 plume behaviour and verified them against sophisticated reservoir simulations. The simple models captured the following trends: leakage potential increases (1) as the time for the CO 2 plume to reach the top seal of the aquifer decreases; (2) as the lateral distance travelled by the plume increases, and (3) as total mobile CO 2 increases. We studied one risk parameter in detail, the time for the CO 2 plume to reach the <b>aquifer</b> <b>top</b> seal, and showed that it varies systematically with gravity number, defined as the ratio of gravity forces to viscous forces. Likely behaviour of an actual saline aquifer relative to that one risk parameter is easily captured by interpolation within the catalogue of detailed simulations for different reservoir and operational parameters. We illustrate the application of these simplified models to assess risks of leakage for a hypothetical sequestration project in a gas storage reservoir for which extensive characterization is available...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} seismic reflection {{study was}} conducted on the Boise River flood plain in southeast Boise in an attempt to laterally map a major sand aquifer and to determine the thickness of the water bearing sedimentary section. Two 12 -fold common depth point seismic lines (approximately 350 m of total subsurface coverage) were obtained using a 12 -gauge buffalo gun source. Placement of the source beneath the water table (at 2 m depth during data acquisition) provided sufficient energy to recover reflections at two-way times up to 395 ms; the frequency content of reflections recorded on a fixed-source noise test exceeded 100 Hz for travel times up to 360 ms. The aquifer is a sand unit within the late Tertiary Idaho Group sediments and is overlain by a clay/silt unit and underlain by a clay unit as determined from a lithologic log of a nearby water well. The two-way travel-times to {{the top and bottom of}} the aquifer as estimated from a travel-time survey of the same water well are 110 and 128 ms; these two-way times correspond to depths of 105 m and 123 m below seismic datum, respectively. The <b>aquifer</b> <b>top</b> is represented by a reflection peak showing moderate continuity, whereas the aquifer bottom is not clearly defined suggesting a low impedance contrast at this boundary. A prominent reflection at approximately 245 ms two-way time probably marks the base of the water-bearing sedimentary section where it overlies a relatively impermeable basalt unit. Based on a stacking velocity range of 1830 - 2260 m/s, the depth to the top of the basalt is 224 - 276 m below seismic datum; this depth represents the thickness of the sedimentary section that is viable for cold groundwater exploration in the immediate area of the seismic lines. A deeper reflection at about 325 ms two-way time may represent a sedimentary basalt interbed or the top of the thick rhyolite sequence that is the principle geothermal aquifer of Boise. Two other reflections at approximately 370 ms and 395 ms two-way times may represent alternating sedimentary and silicic volcanic layers. Fourteen Generalized Reciprocal Method refraction profiles were shot along one line to determine the average thickness (2. 7 m) and average velocity (305 m/s) of the low-velocity layer for use in the initial static correction routine. These data were also used to analyze the relationship between variability in the low-velocity layer and an observed long-wavelength (about 60 m) static shift (approximately 4 ms). The results indicate that the static shift could be caused by a combination of lateral velocity variations within the low-velocity layer and an irregular low-velocity layer thickness...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{groundwater}} flow modelling {{is a prerequisite}} for accurate contaminant transport simulation. We are modeling {{groundwater flow}} in the Uinta Basin Aquifer, Utah, to eventually develop safe strategies for injecting saline waste water into the deep saline Birds Nest Aquifer (BNA). The Uinta Basin contains most Utah oil and gas production. Extraction of oil and gas brings very saline groundwater, a waste byproduct known as produced water. The Utah oil and gas industry in the Uintah Basin must dispose of large volumes of produced water. One technique for produced water disposal is deep injection employing repurposed oil and gas production wells and purposed disposal wells. A candidate formation for this deep injection is BNA, a high secondary-porosity and high secondary-permeability formation underlying part of the Uinta Basin Aquifer. Before addressing density-dependent flow and transport within the BNA, we are modeling flow in the Uintah Basin Aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the BNA. Previous groundwater studies modeled the Uinta Basin Aquifer as having a uniform thickness over a uniform base elevation. Our study utilizes more recent federal and Utah data and co-kriging to more accurately represent the <b>aquifer’s</b> <b>top</b> (elevation range exceeds 5000 feet), and thickness (ranges from about 100 feet to over 8500 feet). The Uinta Basin Aquifer model will provide boundary conditions for the BNA model. The resulting coupled models will better simulate flow and transport for U. S. and Utah agency planning...|$|R

Herein, the water is under perched water table condition. The friable powdery iron ore at depth is porous, permeable, and completely saturated with water. The ore bodies (aquifers) are exposed and water seeps into the mine pits under pressure from them during mining operations and particularly due to large amount of monsoon rainfall in Goa.

40|$|La nappe aquifère de Hesbaye, logée dans les craies du Crétacé, est sollicitée à raison de trente {{millions}} de mètres cubes par an. Bien que naturellement protégée par une épaisseur de 5 à 20 mètres de limons, de nombreux indices montrent une dégradation de la qualité des eaux souterraines, notamment par les nitrates. Les concentrations en nitrates atteignent 15 à 25 mg. l- 1 dans la partie semi-captive de la nappe et sont systématiquement supérieures à 35 mg. l- 1 dans la partie libre. Malgré de fortes fluctuations temporelles, les teneurs augmentent en moyenne de 0, 35 mg. l- 1 à 0, 7 mg. l- 1 par an selon la situation semi-captive ou libre de la nappe. La détermination des paramètres hydrodynamiques et de transport de la craie par plus de 35 traçages répartis sur 11 sites, a permis de réaliser un modèle local (10 km 2) de transport simulant la propagation des nitrates dans la nappe. Le modèle a montré que cette dernière est, malgré une certaine homogénéisation, très sensible aux apports de surface engendrant une très forte variation spatiale des concentrations. La nappe réagit de manière très différente selon que les apports de surface sont d'origine ponctuelle ou diffuse. Pour les pollutions ponctuelles, les concentrations fluctuent rapidement avec des valeurs maximales et minimales observées respectivement en périodes de basses eaux et de hautes eaux. Cette situation est liée à un phénomène de dilution de la pollution par les eaux en provenance de l'amont. En cas de suppression d'une pollution ponctuelle, la qualité de la nappe s'améliore rapidement (délai de 1 à 2 ans). Pour les pollutions diffuses, les concentrations minimales s'observent en période de rabattement de la nappe : le front de nitrates migre plus lentement (environ 1 à 2 m par an) que les vitesses de rabattement de la nappe (jusqu'à 5 m par an) et les intrants restent nuls durant des périodes pouvant aller jusqu'à 3 ans. Différentes simulations mathématiques ont montré que si la quantité d'intrants d'origine diffuse diminue de manière permanente, la nappe mettra une vingtaine d'années pour se rééquilibrer. Ces constatations sont primordiales {{dans le cadre de}} la mise en œuvre de mesures de protection puisque, si les résultats de la suppression des pollutions ponctuelles sont rapidement mais localement observés, ceux liés à la diminution des pollutions d'origine diffuse sont observés dans des délais nettement plus longs (une à deux décennies). Ces résultats montrent clairement que toute gestion qualitative des aquifères doit être basée sur des actions à long terme. The Hesbaye area {{is located}} in the northeastern part of Belgium. The aquifer formations consist of chalk deposits. Groundwater provides about 80, 000 m 3 d- 1. Despite 5 to 20 meters of superficial loess deposits, the groundwater quality is threatened by increasing nitrate concentrations of 0. 35 mg×L- 1 per year in the semi-confined part of the aquifer to 0. 7 mg×L- 1 in the unconfined aquifer. Presently, nitrate concentrations are between 15 and 25 mg×L- 1 in the semi-confined part of the aquifer but are more than 35 mg×L- 1 (reaching locally 150 mg×L- 1) in the unconfined part that covers 95 % of the area. Nitrate concentrations have such a high spatial variation that various statistical treatments (such as kriging used to draw iso-concentration maps) have failed. This failure {{is due to the fact}} that the concentrations are highly influenced by surface land use (grass land, culture land, villages, point source pollutants, etc.). In addition, nitrate content in the aquifer varies vertically with decreasing values at depth (gradient of 0. 7 mg×L- 1 ×m- 1). Aquifer parameters were determined by 38 pumping and tracer tests conducted in radial convergent or cylindrical flow at 11 sites. Results showed that hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 1 × 10 - 6 m×s- 1 to 4 × 10 - 2 m×s- 1 and effective porosities from 0. 5 % to 7 %, showing that the aquifer was heterogeneous. Dispersivity values were affected by scale effects and varied according to chalk weathering or fracture zones. They ranged from less than 5 m in fractures to more than 60 m in weathered chalk (as in the upper part of the aquifer) and in the chalk matrix. In the chalk, transport processes were influenced by the immobile water effect due to diffusive transfer from the moving to the non-moving fluid. Non-effective porosity filled by non-moving fluid was estimated between 8 to 42 %. The transfer constant ranged from 0. 98 × 10 - 7 s- 1 to 10 × 10 - 7 s- 1. The determination of the transport parameters allowed simulation of nitrate transport at a regional scale. The SUFT 3 D (Saturated and Unsaturated Flow and Transport Model), developed by the Hydrogeology Section of the Georesources, Geotechnologies and Building Materials Department of Liege University was used. The modelled groundwater zone was defined as a 2. 0 x 4. 5 km rectangle of 10 km 2. The aquifer was subdivided into 6 layers of 3350 cells (50 x 50 m wide and 3 to 15 m thick). Boundary flow conditions were defined as a prescribed head (Dirichlet conditions) to the north and the south of the area modelled. As the model simulations run for a time period of 30 years, the northern Dirichlet conditions had to be adapted to the regional and seasonal water table fluctuations that were observed during this period. At the south boundary, as the aquifer is drained by the river Geer, the water table is fixed at the river bed altitude. The eastern and western boundaries were, according to the regional piezometry, assumed to be impermeable. For the transport boundary conditions, prescribed flux (Cauchy conditions) was used for the <b>aquifer</b> <b>top.</b> Elsewhere Neumann conditions were usedSimulations were run for the period from 1963 to 1992. Nitrate inputs were averaged yearly and estimated according to actual input conditions. These conditions were calculated by simulation of nitrate flows through the non-saturated part of the aquifer using the EPIC-Model and taking into account the amount of nitrate fertilisers used by farmers (given by the Belgian government Statistical Institute). Initial conditions were calculated according to the 1963 nitrate inputs. Simulations demonstrated that it is important to distinguish the origin of the pollution as either point or non-point (diffuse) sources. For point source pollutants (such as contaminated infiltration basins), aquifer nitrate concentrations increased during low water level periods due to weaker dilution linked with a poor regional water gradient. During high groundwater levels, dilution is more important and the nitrate concentration decreases. If a point source pollutant is suppressed, aquifer quality is improved within one to two years. This demonstrates the importance of protective actions that could be applied within the framework of the protection zones around collecting galleries and pumping fields. For diffuse contamination the mean input over the area (10 m depth below cropped areas) increased from 1. 32 × 10 - 7 mg×m- 2 ×s- 1 in 1963 to 5. 14 × 10 - 7 mg×m- 2 ×s- 1 (i. e., a factor of four). According to these values, concentrations ranged from 11 mg×L- 1 to 22 mg×L- 1 (i. e., increasing by 0. 5 mg×L- 1 per year) between 1963 and 1992. Predictive simulations, using 1992 input, show that it will take more or less 30 years for the aquifer to be in equilibrium with the 1992 input. At that time the mean concentration value will be around 30 mg×L- 1. The main results of the simulations clearly show that if actions are taken to decrease nitrate inputs, even if the aquifer nitrate contents rapidly react to the new input, nitrate levels will decrease slowly and take about 30 years to be in equilibrium with the new inputs. This long delay is due to the immobile water effect that is characteristic of the chalk aquifer. Thus it is important to inform environmentalists who work on action programs (such as the water directive imposed by the European Community in the vulnerable zones) that the effects of their actions must be based on 10 to 20 year scenarios. To this estimation, based on the reaction time of the aquifer to a new input, one must also add the time transfer of the pollutant through the unsaturated part of the aquifer...|$|E

The Thar coalfield covers an area of approximately 9000 km 2 andcontains three lignite seams lying at depth of 130 m to 250 m.

LGM is used to assess the effect of changes in groundwater abstractions upon the geohydrological system. The effect is expressed in terms of hydrological variables, namely the changes in phreatic waterlevel, groundwater head in deeper aquifers, flux between the upper boundary of the geohydrological system and the <b>top</b> <b>aquifer,</b> and fluxes across the aquitards.

LGM is a coupled system of so-called AQ-computer program packages (e. g. AQ-FEM) and a Geographic Information System (GIS).

50|$|Groundwater is {{distributed}} unevenly over {{the territory of}} Namibia, thus making the construction of pipelines necessary to tap their potential. In particular, the coastal area is nearly devoid of groundwater. Recharge in these areas is low and unreliable, groundwater lies at great depths and sometimes is of poor quality. Other areas are favorable, sitting on high-yielding, very productive aquifers that contain more water than farmers and communities presently need. Numerous small springs throughout the country sustain wildlife, man and livestock. Over the past century, more than 100 000 boreholes have been drilled in Namibia. Half of these are still in operation. In 2012 German hydro-geologists discovered a huge aquifer in Northern Namibia that could supply the area, where 40% {{of the population of}} the country lives, for 400 years. The aquifer, called Ohangwena II, contains about 5 billion cubic meters of water which is up to 10,000 years old. The aquifer is about 300 meters deep and is under pressure, so that its water could be pumped up at a relatively low cost. However, a saline <b>aquifer</b> sits on <b>top</b> of the freshwater aquifer, so that drilling must be done carefully in order to avoid saline intrusion. The aquifer receives some recharge from Angola in the North. Experts recommend that, during normal climatic conditions, water abstraction should be limited to the inflow from the North in order to manage the aquifer on a sustainable basis. However, during extended droughts induced by climate change, the aquifer can be drawn down and serve as an important buffer against drought.|$|R

The observed heat flow values are extremely high just seaward of the trench but decrease rapidly landward. We explain this pattern as the consequence of very vigorous hydrothermal circulation in the subducting oceanic crust.

40|$|A {{modelling}} {{approach was}} developed, {{incorporated in the}} finite-element method based program LGMLUC, {{making it possible to}} determine the reliability of travel times of groundwater flowing to groundwater abstraction sites. The reliability is seen here as a band (zone) around the expected travel-time isochrone, with the width of this probability occurrence zone (e. g. between 97. 5 and 2. 5 percentile values) increasing with increasing uncertainty in the model-input parameters. The modelling approach is based on the First-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) method for uncertainty propagation analysis. The FOSM results have been compared with a Monte Carlo analysis for an LGM model and another, LGM-independent model. From the match between FOSM and Monte Carlo results it was concluded that the FOSM approach is an adequate and computationally effective method to analyse the uncertainty of travel times. The travel time was assumed to be log-normally distributed. The uncertainty in several model-input parameters was accounted for as a factor influencing the reliability of travel times. These are aquifer transmissivity, hydraulic resistance of aquitards, drainage and infiltration resistance defining the head-flux relation between the <b>top</b> <b>aquifer</b> and surface waters, effective porosity of aquifers and aquitards, and groundwater recharge rate. All these model-input parameters are assumed to be log-normally distributed. The uncertainty in these parame-ters was derived using inverse-method calibration and expert judgement. The applicability of the modelling approach was demonstrated for a pilot study area in {{the central part of the}} Netherlands. The approach can be used for problems with various spatial resolutions of the finite-element grid, problems ranging from local (high grid density) to regional. The information on the travel-time reliability can be used for policy-related decision-making, such as the examination of risks within the existing groundwater protection zones...|$|R
40|$|Jordan, with roughly 900 million m 3 of {{renewable}} fresh water, {{is considered one}} of the ten most water deprived nations in the world. These water shortages, which are expected to be exacerbated by climate change, are considered to be a key impediment to the nation’s development. Currently the government plans to utilize the Disi aquifer, which can provide 90 million m 3 of water for the next 100 years. Given the importance of this aquifer it is important to assess its quality. In this master’s project we analyze the Disi aquifer’s radium content and explore the implications from these findings. Specifically 22 samples from the aquifer were collected and compared to 38 samples from the rest of Jordan. The samples were analyzed both in terms of the chemical make up as well as their Ra content. Further analysis involved GIS mapping and some basic statistic. Finally work was done to assess the impact of our findings the nation’s water management plan. Our research shows that the Disi aquifer is heavily contaminated with radium, containing on average 9 times the US – EPA limit of 0. 185 Bq/L. Furthermore, we find that there is a significant relationship between the aquifer’s radium content and the concentration of barium and chloride. Given these findings we conclude that only the confined saline group in the Disi aquifer would be safe to utilize for human consumption. If other waters are to be used, they must either be used after treatment, or only for agricultural purposes. Finally, we conclude with that finding that the radium content moves the Disi <b>aquifer</b> from a <b>top</b> choice water management strategy to a lower place in the rankings, but does not eliminate it as a choice all together...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground/Objectives. The {{site is a}} large chloralcali {{chemical}} plant located in the centre-east of France. From the 1980 s to 2007, a several hectares historical DNAPL pool was physically confined while migration was monitored. The DNAPL has rapidly migrated from a landfill and reached a static state within a shallow water-table sandy <b>aquifer</b> at <b>top</b> of a clayey unit at 10 meters depth. Thicknesses of DNAPL have been observed from 20 cm to 150 cm according to substratum morphology. Migration of DNAPL has been controlled by two water pumping wells for thirty years making a water depression {{in the area and}} inverse gradient. The average flow-rate of the hydraulic confinement is 40 m 3 /h. The DNAPL is composed of a mixture of heavy perchlorinated compounds, mainly hexchlorobutadiene (50 %), hexachloroethane (10 %), perchlorethylene, carbon tetrachloride and hexachlorobenzene. The continental climate at the site, with cold winters, adds major constraints due to crystallization of hexachlorobenzene in the mixture. After a review of several DNAPL recovery strategies, various pumping techniques were selected for testing and then implemented in the field. These methods include batch DNAPL pumping with and without water pumping and batch DNAPL pumping with vacuum. Approach/Activities. Location of DNAPL pumping stations was optimized after implementation of drillings and a geostatistical analysis. This revealed interesting features of DNAPL accumulation {{at the top of the}} substratum, such as a main flow channel and connected and disconnected basins. A non-enhanced low-flow batch pumping of DNAPL demonstrated that DNAPL could be recovered continuously at the beginning of the experiment (100 l/h). After a while, a lack of product feeding was observed at the pumping site revealing a threshold pumping rate (5 l/h) caused by weir effects (partially disconnected basin) of the substratum morphology. This demonstrated the limits of batch-pumping stations located above disconnected DNAPL basins. Results/Lessons Learned. When using hydraulic upwelling technique, during the pumping phase, water is pumped at a constant rate of 15 m 3 /h while DNAPL is continuously pumped with an average rate of 20 l/h. The pumping set leads to DNAPL upconing of 0, 30 m while water level decrease by 3 meters. After both pumping ceased, DNAPL recovered to the initial interface static level after 50 hours while water level recover static level almost instantaneously. Water pumping induces a pressure gradient around the well that forces the DNAPL to flow at a higher rate towards the screened well without disconnecting small pools of product. Local pneumatic (vaccum) are being experimented at moment and are demonstrated good results. In order to improve the physical recovery of DNAPL, the optimized techniques implemented in the field tripling the yearly recovery rate between 2008 and 2013 to reach 200 tons...|$|R
40|$|On October 9, 1999 an {{earthquake}} of ML = 3. 6 occurred about 3 km beneath the central cone of Mt. Vesuvius, near Naples, Italy. The event {{had the highest}} magnitude recorded for at least 25 years, and possibly since the last eruption of this volcano (1944), and was not accompanied by other geophysical or geochemical changes. The present paper essentially deals with the seismological data collected at Mt. Vesuvius for 29 years before the October 9 earthquake {{till the end of}} 2001, and describes the time pattern distribution of seismic slip release and the b-parameter of the Gutenberg^Richter distribution. The self-similarity of the source process is investigated through the scaling law of the seismic spectrum. Results indicate a two-fold pattern of stress release, with high values (up to 100 bar) for earthquakes occurring close {{to the top of the}} carbonate basement that underlies the volcano at 2 ^ 3 km of depth, and low values (down to 0. 1 bar) for the shallow events occurring within the volcanic edifice. The scaling law of the seismic spectrum is non-self-similar, indicating that the source dimensions do not scale with the seismic moment. For this reason the low-magnitude events substantially contribute to the overall cumulative seismic slip release. The bparameter of the Gutenberg^Richter distribution shows a variation around 1980, and a substantial constancy in the other time periods. The presence of extended <b>aquifers,</b> with their <b>tops</b> at about 1 km beneath the crater, favors the hypothesis of the triggering of the shallowest events by water-level changes. This hypothesis is in agreement with the low values of the stress drop measured for the shallowest seismic events. The existence of a carbonate basement with its top at about 2. 5 km beneath the crater and the higher stress drops for the deeper events make reasonable the hypothesis that the pre-fractured carbonate basement may be the site of tectonic stress release...|$|R
40|$|Dissolved organic {{contaminants}} that {{decrease the}} surface tension of water (surfactants) {{can have an}} effect on unsaturated flow through porous media due to the dependence of capillary pressure on surface tension. One and two-dimensional (1 D, 2 D) laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to study surfactant-induced unsaturated flow. The 1 D experiments investigated differences in surfactant-induced flow as a function of contaminant mobility. The flow in a system contaminated with a high solubility, mobile surfactant, butanol, was much different than in a system contaminated with a sparingly soluble, relatively immobile surfactant, myristyl alcohol (MA). Because surface tension depression caused by MA was confined to the original source zone, the MA system was modeled using a standard unsaturated flow model (HYDRUS- 1 D) by assigning separate sets of hydraulic functions to the initially clean and source zones. To simulate the butanol system, HYDRUS- 1 D was modified to incorporate surfactant concentration-dependent changes to the moisture content-pressure head and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions. Following the 1 D study, a two-dimensional flow cell (2. 4 x 1. 5 x 0. 1 m) was used to investigate the infiltration of a surfactant contaminant plume from a point source on the soil surface, through the vadose zone, and toward a shallow <b>aquifer.</b> Above the <b>top</b> of the capillary fringe the advance of the surfactant solution caused a drainage front that radiated from the point source. Upon reaching the capillary fringe, the drainage front caused a localized depression of the capillary fringe and eventually a new capillary fringe height was established. Horizontal transport of surfactant in the depressed capillary fringe caused the propagation of a wedge-shaped drainage front in the downgradient direction. The numerical model HYDRUS- 2 D was modified to account for surfactant concentration-dependent effects on the unsaturated hydraulic functions and was successfully used to simulate the surfactant infiltration experiment. The extensive propagation of the drying front and the effect of vadose zone drainage on contaminant breakthrough time demonstrate the potential importance of considering surface tension effects on unsaturated flow and transport in systems containing surface-active organic contaminants or in systems where surfactants are used for remediation of the vadose zone or unconfined aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Exploitation of {{groundwater}} from shallow, high prolific Holocene sedimentary aquifers {{has been a}} main element for achieving safe drinking water and food security in Bangladesh. However, the presence of elevated levels of geogenic arsenic (As) in these aquifers has undermined this success. Except for targeting safe aquifers through installations of tubewells to greater depth, no mitigation option has been successfully implemented on a larger scale. The objective of this study has been to characterise the hydrostratigraphy, groundwater flow patterns, the hydraulic properties to assess the sustainability of the low-arsenic aquifers at Matlab, in south-eastern Bangladesh, {{one of the worst}} arsenic-affected areas of Bangladesh. Combining groundwater modelling with monitoring hydraulic heads in multi-level piezometer tests, 14 C-dating {{of groundwater}}, conventional hydraulic testing and assessment of groundwater abstraction rate proved to be a useful strategy. A model comprising of three <b>aquifers</b> covering the <b>top</b> 250 m of the model domain showed to best fit the evaluation criteria for calibration. Matlab is a recharge area, even though it is adjacent to the great Meghna River. Irrigation wells are placed in clusters and account for most of the groundwater abstraction. Even though the hydraulic heads are affected locally by seasonal pumping, the aquifer system is fully recharged during and after the monsoon period. Groundwater simulations demonstrated the presence of deep regional and horizontal flow systems with recharge areas in the eastern, hilly part of Bangladesh and shallow small local flow systems driven by local topography. Based on modelling and 14 C groundwater data, it can be concluded that the natural local flow systems reach a depth of 30 m b. g. l. in the study area. A downwardvertical gradient of roughly 0. 01 down to 200 m b. g. l. was observed and reproduced bycalibrated models. The vertical gradient is mainly the result of the aquifer system and-properties rather than abstraction rate, which is too limited at depth to make an imprint. Although irrigation wells substantially change local flow pattern, targeting low-As aquifers seems to be a suitable mitigation option for providing people with safe drinkingwater. However, installing new irrigation- or high capacity production wells at the same depth is strongly discouraged as these substantially change the groundwater flow pattern. The results from the present study and other similar studies can further contribute to develop a rational management and mitigation policy for the future use of the groundwater resources for drinking water supplies.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this PhD thesis was the hydrogeological {{conceptualisation}} of the Upper Ouémé river catchment in Benin. The study area exceeds 14, 500 km** 2 and is underlain by a crystalline basement. At this setting the typical sequence of aquifers - a regolith <b>aquifer</b> at the <b>top</b> and a fractured bedrock aquifer at the bottom - is encountered, which is found in basement areas all over Africa {{and elsewhere in the}} world. The chosen regional approach revealed important information about the hydrochemistry and hydrogeology of this catchment. Based on the regional conceptual model a numerical groundwater flow model was designed. The numerical model was used to estimate the impact of climate change on the regional groundwater resources. This study was realised {{within the framework of the}} German interdisciplinary research project IMPETUS (English translation: "Integrated approach to the efficient management of scarce water resources in West Africa"), which is jointly managed by the German universities of Bonn and Cologne. Since the year 2000 the Upper Ouémé catchment was the principal target for investigations into the relevant processes of the regional water cycle. A first study from 2000 to 2003 (Fass, 2004, [URL] focused on the hydrogeology of a small local catchment (~ 30 km** 2). In the course of this thesis five field campaigns were underdone from the year 2004 to 2006. In the beginning of 2004 a groundwater monitoring net was installed based on 12 automatic data loggers. Manual piezometric measurements and the sampling of groundwater and surface water were realised for each campaign throughout the whole study area. Water samples were analysed for major ions, for a choice of heavy metals and for their composition by deuterium, oxygen- 18 and tritium. The numerical model was performed with FEFLOW. The hydraulic and hydrochemical characteristics were described for the regolith aquifer and the bedrock aquifer. The regolith aquifer plays the role of the groundwater stock with low conductivity while the fractures of the bedrock may conduct water relatively fast towards extraction points. Flow in fractures of the bedrock depends on the connectivity of the fracture network which might be of local to subregional importance. Stable isotopes in combination with hydrochemistry proved that recharge occurs on catchment scale and exclusively by precipitation. Influx of groundwater from distant areas along dominant structures like the Kandi fault or from the Atacora mountain chain is excluded. The analysis of tritium in groundwater from different depths revealed the interesting fact of the strongly rising groundwater ages. Bedrock groundwater may possibly be much older than 50 years. Equilibrium phases of the silicate weathering products kaolinite and montmorillonite showed that the deeper part of the regolith aquifer and the bedrock aquifer feature either stagnant or less mobile groundwater while the shallow aquifer level is influenced by seasonal groundwater table fluctuations. The hydrochemical data characterised this zone by the progressive change of the hydrochemical facies of recently infiltrated rainwater on its flow path into deeper parts of the aquifers. Surprisingly it was found out that seasonal influences on groundwater hydrochemistry are minor, mainly because they affect only the groundwater levels close to the surface. The transfer of the hydrogeological features of the Upper Ouémé catchment into a regional numerical model demanded a strong simplification. Groundwater tables are a reprint of the general surface morphology. Pumping or other types of groundwater extraction would have only very local impact on the available groundwater resources. It was possible to integrate IMPETUS scenario data into the groundwater model. As a result it was shown that the impact of climate change on the groundwater resources until the year 2025 under the given conditions will be negligible due to the little share of precipitation needed for recharge and the low water needs for domestic use. Reason for concern is the groundwater quality on water points in the vicinity of settlements because of contamination by human activities as shown for the village of Dogué. Nitrate concentrations achieved in many places already alerting levels. Health risks from fluoride or heavy metals were excluded for the Upper Ouémé area...|$|R
40|$|The Lower Cretaceous Captain Sandstone Member of the Inner Moray Firth has {{significant}} {{potential for the}} injection and storage of anthropogenic CO 2 in saline aquifer parts of the formation. Pre-existing faults constitute a potential risk to storage security owing to the elevated pore pressures likely to result from large-scale fluid injection. Determination of the regional in situ stresses permits mapping of the stress tensor affecting these faults. Either normal or strike-slip faulting conditions are suggested to be prevalent, with the maximum horizontal stress orientated 33 °– 213 °. Slip-tendency analysis indicates that some fault segments are close to being critically stressed under strike-slip stress conditions, with small pore-pressure perturbations of approximately 1. 5  MPa potentially causing reactivation of those faults. Greater pore-pressure increases of approximately 5  MPa {{would be required to}} reactivate optimally orientated faults under normal faulting or transitional normal/strike-slip faulting conditions at average reservoir depths. The results provide a useful indication of the fault geometries most susceptible to reactivation under current stress conditions. To account for uncertainty in principal stress magnitudes, high differential stresses have been assumed, providing conservative fault-stability estimates. Detailed geological models and data pertaining to pore pressure, rock mechanics and stress will be required to more accurately investigate fault stability. Large-scale deployment of CO 2 storage as a strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will rely on the integrity of sealing strata overlying the storage reservoirs to ensure that the captured CO 2 is permanently isolated from the atmosphere (IPCC 2005; Chadwick et al. 2009 a; Holloway 2009). The existence of pre-existing fault systems of varying dimensions is a common feature throughout the subsurface, and the efficacy of seals may potentially be compromised by any enhanced transmissibility associated with fault zones. Within the Moray Firth, the Lower Cretaceous Captain Sandstone Member of the Wick Sandstone Formation has been proposed as a suitable storage reservoir candidate (SCCS 2011; Shell 2011 a; Akhurst et al. 2015). Storage potential exists within depleting hydrocarbon fields (Marshall et al. 2016), while significant additional capacity is available in the surrounding saline <b>aquifer</b> volume. Regional <b>top</b> seals include the Cretaceous Rodby, Carrack and Valhall formations. Simulation studies of CO 2 injection identified the storage capacity of the Captain Sandstone to be between 358 and 2495  Mt (Jin et al. 2012). As the injection of CO 2 is reliant on the displacement of existing pore fluids, large-scale injection results in increased pore-fluid pressure, the effects of which will be felt across large areas in well-connected aquifer systems (Chadwick et al. 2009 b; Jin et al. 2012; Noy et al. 2012). It is well documented that some faults are transmissible to fluid flow, while others act as effective capillary seals (Caine et al. 1996; Aydin 2000; Faulkner et al. 2010). Whether cross-fault flow occurs depends on the juxtaposition of lithologies in the footwall and hanging-wall blocks, as well as the composition of the fault zone and any differential pressure across the fault. In addition, reactivation of previously stable faults caused by increasing pressure, and therefore a reduction in the effective stress, could allow faults to become transmissive to buoyant fluids, such as supercritical CO 2, due to the opening of flow pathways during failure (Streit & Hillis 2004). It is this aspect of fault stability that forms the focus of this study, with respect to the Captain Sandstone of the Inner Moray Firth, and utilizing an adaptation of the geological model presented by Jin et al. (2012). Analysis of the geomechanical stability of faults offsetting the Captain Sandstone requires the contemporary stress field affecting the basin to be characterized, in order to resolve the shear and normal stresses acting on mapped faults and to determine which faults, or segments of faults, are most susceptible to becoming reactivated if pore-fluid pressures in the basin are increased as a result of CO 2 injection. In order to do so, detailed knowledge of the pore-pressure conditions at depth, the magnitude and orientations of the principal stresses, and the properties of the faults is required...|$|R
