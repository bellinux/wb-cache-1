40|$|Phosphorus {{is known}} to {{contribute}} to eutrophication of fresh water systems, as generally it is the limiting nutrient controlling algae growth. Laboratory studies were conducted to develop and test <b>active</b> <b>barriers</b> composed of aluminium oxide immobilized on to polyolefins to remove phosphorus from water. For this purpose, flat plates of polyethylene and polyethylene grafted with maleic anhydride were prepared and tested. The adsorption mechanism of phosphorus on to aluminium oxide was described by the Freundlich isotherm. The optimum pH interval for phosphorus removal was between 5. 2 and 7. 8, which includes the pH of natural waters. The maximum phosphorus removal capacity was around 11. 1 ì g/cm 2 for both <b>active</b> <b>barriers.</b> Both barriers removed more than 90 % of phosphorus from a 100 ì g/L solution in a static batch experiment carried out for 90 d. The in situ implementation of the <b>active</b> <b>barriers</b> developed {{in the present study}} might be a valuable strategy to sequester phosphate and thus to control eutrophication in natural ecosystems, though further work is required to evaluate possible interferences coming from other substances present in the water.

Barrier creams can be applied before exposure to potential irritants, but are not typically used as the main protection against hazardous substances. They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers; in particular, gloves provide greater protection. However barrier creams are reasonably effective for protection of the face against some airborne substances. <b>Active</b> <b>barrier</b> creams containing silicone, tartaric acid, glycerin, and other ingredients are said to be beneficial for some chromate-sensitive construction workers.|$|E

Results of the 13 -months experimental study indicate that the enclosure of the oxygen scavenger in the plastic matrix is able to better maintain the quality and authenticity attributes of the EVOO: a reduced flux of oxygen through the PET bottle keeps the level of primary and secondary oxidation products lower than that obtained in simple PET bottles stored under the same conditions. The <b>active</b> <b>barrier</b> reduces the EVOO antioxidant activity decline during storage. The chlorophylls content decay can only be prevented via the storage of the sample in the dark, while the <b>active</b> <b>barrier</b> is able to diminish the carotenes loss {{at the end of the}} shelf life.

30|$|In all {{the tests}} the methane/air mixture were ignited using a {{standard}} fuse cap. The fuse was chosen {{simply because it}} produces a very small flame {{that would not be}} seen or recognised by the sensor triggering the <b>active</b> <b>barrier</b> suppression system.|$|E
30|$|In {{the design}} of {{explosion}} barriers, the suppressant agent should be ideally dispersed as the flame front reaches the barrier (Zou 2001). If the suppressant agent is dispersed prematurely, the suppressant will be driven downstream and its concentration will be diluted by the explosion-induced wind force before being overtaken by the flame. When the suppressant agent is dispersed to late, the suppressant cloud is behind the flame where it has minimal effect in distinguishing the flame. With passive barriers, {{it is difficult to}} ensure optimal conditions (Zou 2001). <b>Active</b> <b>barriers</b> with triggering devices are therefore developed to try and meet this need.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBased on model calculations, we {{predict a}} magnetoelectric {{tunneling}} electroresistance effect in multiferroic tunnel junctions consisting of ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetoelectric antiferromagnetic barriers. Switching of the antiferromagnetic order parameter in the barrier in applied electric field {{by means of}} the magnetoelectric coupling leads to a substantial change of the resistance of the junction. The effect is explained in terms of the switching of the orientations of local magnetizations at the barrier interfaces affecting the spin-dependent interface transmission probabilities. Magnetoelectric multiferroic materials with finite ferroelectric polarization exhibit an enhanced resistive change due to polarization-induced spin-dependent screening. These results suggest that devices with <b>active</b> <b>barriers</b> based on single-phase magnetoelectric antiferromagnets represent an alternative nonvolatile memory concept...|$|R

However, in their standard form, they lack flexibility inasmuch as they feature a constant barrier level during the entire option life.
