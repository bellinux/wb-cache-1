50|$|Whether or not {{polymers}} can crystallize {{depends on}} their molecular structure - presence of straight chains with regularly spaced side groups facilitates crystallization.

50|$|The {{problem of}} {{branching}} occurs during propagation, when a chain curls back on itself and breaks - leaving irregular chains sprouting {{from the main}} carbon backbone. Branching makes the polymers less dense and results in low tensile strength and melting points. Developed by Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta in the 1950s, Ziegler-Natta catalysts (triethylaluminium {{in the presence of}} a metal(IV) chloride) largely solved this problem. Instead of a free radical reaction, the initial ethene monomer inserts between the aluminium atom and one of the ethyl groups in the catalyst. The polymer is then able to grow out from the aluminium atom and results in almost totally unbranched chains. With the new catalysts, the tacticity of the polypropene chain, the alignment of alkyl groups, was also able to be controlled. Different metal chlorides allowed the selective production of each form i.e., syndiotactic, isotactic and <b>atactic</b> <b>polymer</b> chains could be selectively created.|$|E

Rheological data show that PLA has the typical properties of a linear and semi-stiff polymer chain.

Most commercial PLA grades include {{a large majority of}} L-Lactic acid, the polymer is named in that case PLLA. PLLA is at room temperature a brittle glassy polymer and its main fracture mechanism is crazing. Above glass transition, the semicrystalline PLLA shows extensive cavitation. Uniaxial deformation above, but near the glass transition temperature leads to the formation of a mesophase, responsible for strain hardening. At higher temperatures, strain hardening is caused by induced crystallization. The PLLA oxygen barrier properties are comparable to polystyrene (PS). The water vapor barrier properties are higher than that of PS because of the higher polarity of the polymer chain.

40|$|The {{reaction}} between atomic chromium {{and neat}} 2 -vinylpyridine {{leads to the}} polymerization of the monomer, forming a polymer glass. The product of the rapid polymerization of neat monomer is atactic poly(2 -vinylpyridine) in which the chromium has been incorporated as a complex. From cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption studies, it was proposed that the chromium forms a neutral complex with a severely distorted octahedral geometry and consists of a formally Cr 2 + metal center. The metal would then form an organometallic complex that is also bound via the nitrogen atom to pendant pyridine rings. The polymerization of 2 -vinylpyridine in 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran at - 78 °C after reaction with chromium atoms leads {{to the formation of}} isotactic poly(2 -vinylpyridine) with 50 % mmm isotactic content from the 13 C NMR spectrum. A coordination polymerization mechanism at a chromium metal center is proposed to occur during this reaction. Semicrystalline poly(2 -vinylpyridine) was formed by annealing the isotactic polymer. The highest melting temperature reported for this polymer by differential scanning calorimetry was that observed with our sample at 217 °C. The <b>atactic</b> <b>polymer</b> from the rapid polymerization of neat monomer displayed a glass transition at 95 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/minute, but did not melt. The morphology of the crystalline portions of the isotactic polymer after annealing consisted of spherulites displaying both "Maltese Cross" and banding under cross polarizers. Bis(eta 6 - 1 -methylnaphthalene) chromium was synthesized by the metal atom route. This complex was reacted with 2 -vinylpyridine producing an <b>atactic</b> <b>polymer</b> glass from the resulting rapid polymerization of the monomer. This rapid polymerization was not inhibited by CO 2 (g), but was quenched upon addition of hydroquinone. These results support a radical propagation mechanism that forms the polymer glass. A cryogenic vacuum station was designed and constructed for the low-temperature (15 K) electron paramagnetic resonance characterization of the reaction products from the cocondensation of atomic vanadium with 2 -vinylpyridine. The cocondensation of benzene with vanadium atoms produced bis(eta 6 -benzene) vanadium that displayed the characteristic axial spectrum. No signal was observed for reactions between vanadium atoms and nitrogen heterocycles including 2, 6 -dimethylpyridine and 2 -vinylpyridine. The incorporation of atomic iron and cobalt into 2 -vinylpyridine following the addition of atomic chromium leads to a rapid polymerization reaction forming a polymer composite consisting of magnetic metal particles embedded in poly(2 -vinylpyridine). The particle sizes were measured by transmission electron microscopy to be 1. 5 [...] 22 nm in diameter. Magnetometry studies indicated the additional presence of smaller particles not identified by microscopy. The observation of a ferromagnetic resonance spectrum from the cobalt sample at X-band frequency is consistent with the cobalt particles having undergone an allotropic phase transition to the face-centered cubic phase. The addition of atomic Ni to the monomer did not yield metal particles, but instead, a nickel complex with the polymer matrix is formed. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of this polymeric material below 40 K are consistent with the Ni metal being present as an organometallic formally Ni 1 + center in an octahedral complex bound to the polymer...|$|E
40|$|In {{the melt}} polymer conformations are nearly ideal {{according}} to Flory's ideality hypothesis. Silberberg generalized this statement for chains in the interfacial region. We check the Silberberg argument {{by analyzing the}} conformations of a probe chain end-grafted at a solid surface {{in a sea of}} floating free chains of concentration f by the self-consistent field (SCF) method. Apart from the grafting, probe chain and floating chains are identical. Most of the results were obtained for a standard SCF model with freely jointed chains on a six-choice lattice, where immediate step reversals are allowed. A few data were generated for a five-choice lattice, where such step reversals are forbidden. These coarse-grained models describe the equilibrium properties of flexible <b>atactic</b> <b>polymer</b> chains at the scale of the segment length. The concentration was varied over the whole range from f = 0 (single grafted chain) to f = 1 (probe chain in the melt). The number of contacts with the surface, average height of the free end and its dispersion, average loop and train length, tail size distribution, end-point and overall segment distributions were calculated for a grafted probe chain as a function of f, for several chain lengths and substrate/polymer interactions, which were varied from strong repulsion to strong adsorption. The computations show that the conformations of the probe chain in the melt do not depend on substrate/polymer interactions and are very similar to the conformations of a single end-grafted chain under critical conditions, and can thus be described analytically. When the substrate/polymer interaction is fixed at the value corresponding to critical conditions, all equilibrium properties of a probe chain are independent of f, over the whole range from a dilute solution to the melt. We believe that the conformations of all flexible chains in the surface region of the melt are close to those of an appropriate single chain in critical conditions, provided that one end of the single chain is fixed at the same point as a chain in the melt...|$|E
25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg.

The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory.

However, many SSCs are deactivated by undergoing reactions with the electronegative atoms in the polar groups. In the present work, we attempted to copolymerize ethylene with methyl acrylate using three SSCs: (1) a bis(imino) pyridyl iron(II) chloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst, (2) a chiral metallocene / tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane catalyst, and (3) an in situ trifluromethyl substituted nickel (II) enolate catalyst. Only the first two catalysts led to polymer formation. The metallocene had relatively low activities and formed polymethyl acrylate. The most efficient catalyst for the synthesis of the copolymers was the ironbased catalyst 1. The ethylene consumption indicates that its activity reaches a maximum after which it steadily declines. By kinetic measurements, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and the measurement of glass and melting temperatures, we could show that copolymers of ethylene and methyl acrylate were not formed. The products formed were blends, of high density polyethylene and methyl acrylate. Homopolymerizations of methyl acrylate using the three catalyst systems were also studied. Again {{it was found that the}} catalyst 1 had the highest activities. <b>Atactic</b> <b>polymers</b> were formed. There was a clear dependence of the activity and molecular weight on the Al/Fe-ratio, which indicates that the polymerization mechanism is coordinative and not initiated by radical species...|$|R
40|$|A thermodynamical {{framework}} is presented {{that describes the}} solidification of molten polymers to an amorphous {{as well as to}} a semicrystalline solid-like state. This framework fits into a general structure developed for materials undergoing a large class of entropy producing processes. The molten polymers are usually isotropic in nature and certain polymers crystallize, with the exception of largely <b>atactic</b> <b>polymers,</b> which solidify to an amorphous solid, to an anisotropic solid. The symmetry of the crystalline structures in the semicrystalline polymers is dependent upon the thermomechanical process to which the polymer is subjected to. The framework presented takes into account that the natural configurations associated with the polymer melt (associated with the breaking and reforming of the polymer network) and the solid evolve in addition to the evolving material symmetry associated with these natural configurations. The functional form of the various primitives such as how the material stores, dissipates energy and produces entropy are prescribed. Entropy may be produced by a variety of mechanisms such as conduction, dissipation, solidification, rearragement of crystalline structures due to annealing and so forth. The manner in which the natural configurations evolve is dictated by the maximization of the rate of dissipation. Similarly, the crystallization and glass transition kinetics may be obtained by maximization of their corresponding entropy productions. The restrictions placed by the second law of thermodynamics, frame indiference, material symmetry and incompressibility allows for a class of constitutive equations and the maximization of the rate of entropy production is invoked to select a constitutive equation from an allowable class of constitutive equations. Using such an unified thermodynamic approach, the popular crystallization equations such as Avrami equation and its various modifications such as Nakamura and Hillier and Price equations are obtained. The predictions of the model obtained using this framework are compared with the spinline data for amorphous and semicrystalline polymers...|$|R
5000|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of polymerization {{is concerned}} with the difference in atom connectivity and spatial orientation in polymers that has the same chemical composition.Staudinger studied the stereoisomerism in chain polymerization of vinyl monomers in late 1920s, and it took another two decades for people to fully appreciate the idea that each of the propagation steps in the polymer growth could give rise to stereoisomerism. The major milestone in the stereochemistry was established by Ziegler and Natta and their coworkers in 1950s, as they developed metal based catalyst to synthesize stereoregular polymers. The reason why the stereochemistry of the polymer is of particular interest is because the physical behavior of a polymer depends not only on the general chemical composition but also on the more subtle differences in microstructure. [...] <b>Atactic</b> <b>polymers</b> consist of a random arrangement of stereochemistry and are amorphous (noncrystalline), soft materials with lower physical strength. The corresponding isotactic (like substituents all on the same side) and syndiotactic (like substituents of alternate repeating units on the same side) polymers are usually obtained as highly crystalline materials. It is easier for the stereoregular polymers to pack into a crystal lattice since they are more ordered and the resulting crystallinity leads to higher physical strength and increased solvent and chemical resistance as well as differences in other properties that depend on crystallinity. The prime example of the industrial utility of stereoregular polymers is polypropene. Isotactic polypropene is a high-melting (165 °C), strong, crystalline polymer, which is used as both a plastic and fiber. Atactic polypropene is an amorphous material with an oily to waxy soft appearance that finds use in asphalt blends and formulations for lubricants, sealants, and adhesives, but the volumes are minuscule compared to that of isotactic polypropene.|$|R

40|$|Biomaterial {{science has}} become an {{important}} aspect in medical developments, and many so-called ‘biomaterials’ have emerged. These materials should be biocompatible, i. e. perform with an appropriate host response on a specific application without causing e. g. inflammatory or toxicological responses, and preferably biodegradable, i. e. removed from the body due to natural, biological processes. Important examples are poly(lactic acid) s (PLA) and poly(ε-caprolactone) s (PCL), which are conveniently prepared by ring-opening polymerization (ROP). For these chiral monomers, stereoselectivity of the ROP catalyst {{has become an}} important topic, since enrichment in stereoregular sequences in the resulting polymers can significantly affect the material properties. Seven ROP catalysts have been decribed in the thesis, that is: three phenolate-ligated zinc-based catalysts of the type [LnZnEt] 2 (Chapter 3) and three thiophenolate-ligated zinc-based catalysts of the type [LnZnEt]n (Chapter 4) for the ROP of lactide, and R,R’-(salen) aluminum isopropoxide for the ROP of 4 -methyl-ε-caprolactone and 6 -methyl-ε-caprolactone (Chapter 5). Polymerizations of the zinc phenolates were fast and well-controlled. The stereoselectivity of 2, 6 -bis[(dimethylamino) methyl]- 4 -methylphenoxy ethylzinc was shown {{to depend on the}} polymerization medium, giving <b>atactic</b> <b>polymers</b> in dichloromethane and isotactic enrichments in THF and toluene (Pm ≈ 0. 60). The polymerizations using the zinc thiophenolates resulted in heterotactic enrichment (Pr ≈ 0. 60). The catalyst R,R’-(salen) aluminum isopropoxide (previously shown to preferably polymerize S,S-lactide over R,R-lactide) showed a preference for the R-enantiomer in the ROP of 6 -methyl-ε-caprolactone, but no stereoselectivity upon polymerizing 4 -methyl-ε-caprolactone. Chapter 6 describes the synthesis of γ-Boc-amino-ε-caprolactone and ring-opening reactions thereof. Rather than giving the functional amine-protected poly(ε-caprolactone), γ-Boc-amino-ε-caprolactone rearranged into an oxopyrrolidine carboxylate. Chapter 7 decribes the synthesis of several heterotelechelic polylactides. It was shown that PLA crystallization as well as stereocomplexation is hampered by modification of the chain ends. Chapter 8 describes the synthesis of PLA-dextran copolymers, with grafting based upon carbamate and secondary amine linkages, and the formation of hydrogels thereof. Although the hydrolytic stability of the copolymers was higher when compared to grafting by ester or carbonate linkages, their relatively poor water solubility resulted in rather weak hydrogels (200 - 500 Pa), which cannot bear heavy loads but may serve as vehicles for the release of e. g. medicine...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ring-opening}} polymerizations of γ-methyl substituted six- and seven-membered ring cyclic carbonates, namely trimethylene carbonate (TMC-γMe) and the one-carbon larger homologue tetramethylene carbonate (7 CC-γMe), using [(BDIiPr) Zn(N(SiMe 3) 2) ] (BDIiPr = 2 -((2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) amido) - 4 -((2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) -imino) - 2 -pentene) as {{a catalyst}} precursor {{in the presence of}} benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as an initiator have been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This computational study highlights the very active nature of the zinc-alkoxide catalyst obtained via alcoholysis of the Zn–N bond of [(BDIiPr) Zn(N(SiMe 3) 2) ] by HOBn, leading to the replacement of N(SiMe 3) 2 by an –OBn alkoxide with concomitant release of HN(SiMe 3) 2. For both TMC-γMe and 7 CC-γMe, the initiation and the propagation steps occur according to a three-step process: first, a nucleophilic attack of the alkoxide group followed by the ring-opening of the tetrahedral intermediate and finally the decoordination of the carbonate arm. In the methyl-substituted monomers, the presence of a stereogenic center and, more importantly, the dissymmetry of the monomers raise issues of the stereo- and regio-selectivity during the ROP process. In agreement with experimental results, for both carbonates, the relative Gibbs-free energies of the intermediates and the activation barriers involved in the ROP of both enantiomers (R and S) are very close, which is consistent with the formation of <b>atactic</b> <b>polymers.</b> In the same way, due to the presence of the γ-methyl substituent, two different products can be obtained upon cleavage of the acyl–oxygen bonds during the initiation step, and four different products during the propagation step. For both 7 CC-γMe and TMC-γMe, computations indicate a preferential ring-opening at the most hindered oxygen–acyl O 1 –C(O) O bond, i. e. the one closest to the Me substituent, in agreement with the regioselectivities experimentally observed. The relaxation of the steric constraints inside the growing polymer chain appears to be an important feature. From a thermodynamic point of view, the overall polymerization process is exergonic (7 CC-γMe) or almost athermic (TMC-γMe), in agreement with the easier polymerizability of seven- vs. six-membered carbonate rings, as also observed with unsubstituted carbonates...|$|R
