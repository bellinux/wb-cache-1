25|$|In 1904, Fritz Ullmann {{found out}} that copper powder could {{significantly}} improve the reaction of <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> with phenols to give biaryl ethers. This reaction is known as Ullmann condensation. In 1906, I. Goldberg extended this reaction to synthesize an arylamine by reacting <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> with an amide {{in the presence of}} Potassium Carbonate and CuI. This reaction is known as Goldberg modified Ullmann condensation. In 2003, R. A. Batey and T. D. Quach have modified this kind of reactions by using potassium organotrifluoroborates salts to react with aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic amines or anilines to synthesize aryl ethers or aryl amines.|$|E
25|$|A third {{method is}} by {{palladium}} catalysed reaction of <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> and triflates with diboronyl esters in a coupling reaction. An alternative to esters in {{this method is}} the use of diboronic acid or tetrahydroxydiboron (2).|$|E

25|$|In 1979, N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki {{reported}} {{the synthesis of}} arylated (E)-alkenes in high yield from <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> with alkyl-1-enylboranes and catalyzed by tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and bases. Then A. Suzuki and co-workers extend this kind of reaction to other organoboron compounds and other alkenyl, aryl, alkyl halides and triflate. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction organoboron compounds and these organic halides to form carbon-carbon bonds are known as Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling.|$|E
25|$|Reductive {{coupling}} is {{a coupling}} reaction of <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> with a stoichiometric equivalent of copper metal {{that occurs in}} the Ullmann reaction. In {{an example of a}} present-day cross coupling reaction called decarboxylative coupling, a catalytic amount of Cu(I) displaces a carboxyl group forming the arylcopper (ArCu) intermediate. Simultaneously, a palladium catalyst converts an aryl bromide to the organopalladium intermediate (Ar'PdBr), and on transmetallation the biaryl is formed from ArPdAr'.|$|E
25|$|This {{cycle is}} not limited to vinyl compounds, in the Sonogashira {{coupling}} one of the reactants is an alkyne and in the Suzuki coupling the alkene is replaced by an aryl boronic acid and in the Stille reaction by an aryl stannane. The cycle also extends to the other group 10 element nickel for example in the Negishi coupling between <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> and organozinc compounds. Platinum forms strong bonds with carbon and does not have a catalytic activity in this type of reaction.|$|E
50|$|The Castro-Stephens {{coupling}} is a {{cross coupling}} reaction between a copper(I) acetylide and an <b>aryl</b> <b>halide</b> in pyridine, forming a disubstituted alkyne and a copper(I) halide.|$|R
50|$|The Ullmann {{condensation}} {{is similar}} to the Williamson method except that the substrate is an <b>aryl</b> <b>halide.</b> Such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.|$|R
5000|$|In this radical {{substitution}} the <b>aryl</b> <b>halide</b> 1 accepts {{an electron}} from an radical initiator forming a radical anion 2. This intermediate collapses into an aryl radical 3 and a <b>halide</b> anion. The <b>aryl</b> radical reacts with the nucleophile 4 {{to a new}} radical anion 5 which goes on to form the substituted product by transferring its electron to new <b>aryl</b> <b>halide</b> in the chain propagation. Alternatively the phenyl radical can abstract any loose proton from 7 forming the arene 8 in a chain termination reaction.|$|R
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is called the}} Williamson ether synthesis. It involves treatment of a parent alcohol with a strong base to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable leaving group (R–X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include iodide, bromide, or sulfonates. This method usually does not work well for <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> (e.g. bromobenzene, see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.|$|E
25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} {{commonly}} formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.|$|E

50|$|The {{reaction}} {{works best}} for forming asymmetrical products if the halide reactants are somehow separate in their relative chemical reactivities. One way to accomplish this is to form the reactants with halogens of different periods. Typically the alkyl halide is made more reactive than the <b>aryl</b> <b>halide,</b> increasing {{the probability that the}} alkyl halide will form the organosodium bond first and thus act more effectively as a nucleophile toward the <b>aryl</b> <b>halide.</b> Typically the reaction is used for the alkylation of aryl halides; however, with the use of ultrasound the reaction can also be made useful for the production of biphenyl compounds.|$|R
2500|$|For the {{coupling}} of <b>aryl</b> <b>halides</b> with aryl Grignard reagents, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) {{is also a}} good catalyst.

2500|$|CuI {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} synthesis. In {{combination}} with 1,2- or 1,3 diamine ligands, CuI catalyzes the conversion of aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl bromides into the corresponding iodides.

[...] <b>Aryl</b> <b>halides</b> are used to form carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds in process such as the Heck, Stille, Suzuki, Sonogashira and Ullmann type coupling reactions. [...] Aryl iodides, however, are more reactive than the corresponding aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. 2-Bromo-1-octen-3-ol and 1-nonyne are coupled when combined with dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II), CuI, and diethylamine to form 7-methylene-8-hexadecyn-6-ol.|$|E
