50|$|Syntactic ambiguity, {{also called}} <b>amphiboly</b> or amphibology, is a {{situation}} where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amphiboly</b> occurs {{frequently}} in poetry, sometimes {{owing to the}} alteration of {{the natural order of}} words for metrical reasons. The sentence could be taken to mean that Henry will depose the duke, or that the duke will depose Henry.|$|E
50|$|In humor, {{errors of}} {{reasoning}} {{are used for}} comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of <b>amphiboly,</b> for instance, to make ironic statements; Gary Larson and Scott Adams employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive {{by means of a}} whole host of informal and formal fallacies.|$|E
5000|$|Philosophers (and {{other users}} of logic) {{spend a lot}} of time and effort searching for and {{removing}} (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, [...] "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after [...] "taxes" [...] (to convey the first sense) or by changing [...] "which" [...] to [...] "that" [...] (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true - an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of <b>amphiboly</b> and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} joins {{recent research}} on problems with ambiguity in two fields, argumentation and computing. In argumentation, {{there is a}} concern with fallacies arising from ambiguity, including equivocation and <b>amphiboly.</b> In computing, the development of agent communication languages are based on conversation policies that {{make it possible to}} have information exchanges on the internet, as well as other forms of dialogue like persuasion and negotiation, in which ambiguity is a problem. Because {{it is not possible to}} sharply differentiate between problems arising from ambiguity and those arising from vagueness, obscurity and indeterminacy, some study of the latter is included. The semantic web is based on what are called ontologies, or systems of classification of concepts, shown to be useful tools for dealing with these problems. Key Words: conversational rules, polysemy, equivocation, <b>amphiboly,</b> legal argumentation, multi-agent communication, semantic web, ontologies. Ambiguity is often held to be a bad thing in argumentation, because fallacies like equivocation and <b>amphiboly</b> may occur (van Laar, 2003). Ambiguity, along with it...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{will discuss}} the {{relationship}} between Kant’s and Leibniz’s positions on a question which is rather specific, and yet central to understand correctly the epistemological conceptions of these two philosophers. We will compare Kant’s and Leibniz’s positions {{on the relationship between}} knowing subjects and known objects. We shall begin by looking into the <b>Amphiboly.</b> However, we will not discuss all of Kant’s arguments in detail, as such discussions are readily available in the literature. We do not aim to defend the primacy of Leibniz’s or Kant’s conception of the relationship between knowing subjects and known objects, as some scholars have done. Rather, we will try to individuate the main reason for Kant’s disagreement with Leibniz in the <b>Amphiboly.</b> Then, commenting on this disagreement, we shall highlight two important aspects of the relationship between Kant’s and Leibniz’s philosophies regarding knowing subjects and known objects...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares Kant’s and Leibniz’s {{views on}} the {{relation}} between knowing subjects and known objects. Kant discusses Leibniz’s views in {{the section of the}} first Critique entitled 'The <b>Amphiboly</b> of the Concepts of Reflection'. According to Kant, Leibniz’s main error is mistaking objects in space and time for mind-independent things in themselves, namely, for monads. The paper argues for two claims. First, Leibniz’s conception of objects in space and time is not so radically different from Kant’s conception as the latter suggests. For Leibniz, as for Kant, objects in space and time are mind-dependent. Second, a stark contrast between Kant’s and Leibniz’s philosophies concerns the status of knowing subjects. Leibniz conceives of knowing subjects as substances. Kant denies that we can know whether knowing subjects are substances. Kant conceives of knowing subjects as complex systems of cognitive capacities...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} it {{is argued}} that Kant's critique of Leibniz as found in the <b>amphiboly</b> chapter of the Critique of Pure Reason derives from his theory of reflection. It is argued further that this unfocused and fragmentary <b>amphiboly</b> chapter, which contains the Leibniz-critique, can be seen to have a previously unsuspected unity to it. The keys to perceiving this unity are the appendix's purpose, structure and mosaic composition. The primary purpose of the appendix is not to present Kant's criticisms of Leibniz as is commonly thought, but rather it is to sketch his theory of reflection. Not only is this attested to by Kant himself (A 270 /B 326), it is also made evident by the structure of the appendix. Structurally, the appendix is built around an introduction to the operation of transcendental reflection and a discussion of the concepts of reflection, this being the structure of each of the first three sections. By means of each pair of concepts of reflection Kant claims to summarize the basic tenets and origin of Leibniz's philosophy. Kant also claims that Leibnizls whole philosophy rests on one seminal error, which will be shown to be the omission of the operation of transcendental reflection. To be sure, Kant claims Leibniz made a number of other errors, but these various errors all derive from the omission of transcendental reflection. While this omission can be used to explain the other more well-known epistemological mistakes with which Kant charges Leibniz, it is undeniable that there are certain textual difficulties with the appendix. These can be dealt with by the hypothesis that the different sections were composed at different times and than pieced together without detailed revisions. If such a mosaic composition is granted, then some allowance can be made for the noticeable incongruities between these sections and for occasional problematic passages. This does not, however, warrant the claim that the appendix is not properly placed or unimportant. On the contrary, supplemented by clearer statements of Kant's theory of reflection and of his Leibniz-critique, the following interpretation shows that the appendix is properly placed and integral to the primary aims of the Critique of Pure Reason...|$|E
40|$|In what follows, I will detail Kant 2 ̆ 7 s {{criticism}} of the Leibnizian conception of mind as it is presented in key chapters of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft. Approaching Kant with such a focus goes against the current predominant in contemporary Kant scholarship. Kant 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with Leibniz in the KrV is often taken as limited to the refutation of the latter 2 ̆ 7 s relational theory {{of space and time}} in the Aesthetic and the general criticism presented in the <b>Amphiboly</b> chapter, inasmuch as Kant is taken to be primarily concerned with addressing empiricist opponents (a focus particularly evident in the English-language commentary). In addition, the argument against rational psychology in the Paralogisms is taken as challenging an essentially Cartesian position. The first two chapters of this project will introduce the Leibnizian conception of the mind, contrasting it with its Cartesian predecessor, and consider the career of the Leibnizian conception in the schools of 18 th century Germany. As I will show, it was the Leibnizian conception of mind that held sway, despite scattered challenges, and that would have primarily been on Kant 2 ̆ 7 s mind when he turned to consider the extravagant claims of metaphysical psychology. In chapters 3 - 5, I turn to Kant 2 ̆ 7 s {{criticism of}} this conception as presented in the Transcendental Analytic of the KrV. There, I show how the subjective and objective deductions, in addition to the <b>Amphiboly</b> chapter, all address the Leibnizian claim of a parallelism between the investigations of the mental and the physical. In chapters 6 - 8, I consider the case against the Leibnizian conception of mind as presented in the Transcendental Dialectic, claiming that the doctrine of transcendental illusion plays an important (though largely ignored) role in explaining the grounds of the Leibnizian conception as it is transmitted in the rational psychology of Wolff, Baumgarten, Crusius, and Kant himself in the 17702 ̆ 7 s. Moreover, I argue that the limits Kant sets to empirical psychology are consistent with his {{criticism of the}} Leibnizian conception of mind, and, significantly, are motivated by deeper practical concerns...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I aim {{to clarify the}} nature of Kant’s {{transformation}} of rationalist metaphysics into a science by focusing on his conception of transcendental reflection. The aim of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, it is argued, consists primarily in liberating the productive strand of former general metaphysics – its reflection on the a priori elements of all knowledge – from the uncritical application of these elements to all things (within general metaphysics itself) and to things {{that can only be}} thought (in special metaphysics). After considering Kant’s conception of metaphysics and his various uses of the term ‘transcendental’ I closely examine his account of logical and transcendental reflection in the section entitled ‘On the <b>Amphiboly</b> of the Concepts of Reflection’. Whereas commentators generally attribute the activity called transcendental reflection to Kant alone, I contend, first, that Kant regarded philosophy as such to rely on a mode of transcendental reflection and, second, that the critical mode of transcendental reflection enacted in the Critique itself yields insight into the reason why our a priori knowledge is limited to the realm of possible objects. This is illustrated by outlining the difference between Kant’s and Leibniz’ employment of the concepts of reflection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ever since Schopenhauer ́s accusation, it {{has been}} disputed whether Kant ́s few remarks {{concerning}} the ethical human-animal-relationship in the Lectures and in the Doctrine of Virtue fail to support ethical arguments on behalf of animals. One critique that plays a central role is whether Kant would have forbidden cruelty to brutes for educational purposes. In addition to these old objections, Kant ́s ethics is charged to be speciesistic by animal ethicists and animal rights philosophers at present. The following article examines especially § 17 of the Doctrine of Virtue, {{which is the only}} animal ethical text authorized by Kant himself. The interpretation starts by taking the context of § 17 into account, particularly the “Episodic Section on an <b>Amphiboly</b> in Moral Concepts”. The systematic output of the cruelty-account and of the duty classes is then analyzed. Central for the understanding of Kant ́s argumentation relating to animals are the perfect duties to oneself, which are linked to Kant ́s foundation of human dignity. Finally the roles of the physical and emotional needs of brutes and humans in Kant ́s ethics are compared with each other. Some conclusions are then drawn concerning human and animal rights in relation to a duty-based argumentation. The article therefore appreciates Kant ́s integration of animal suffering into the very core of his virtue ethics, an integration that may be able to open the door for an enlightened animal ethics based on human responsibility...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, Lévinas’s criticisms and reformulations of Sartre’s {{phenomenology}} of imagination, in {{the early}} text “Reality and its Shadow,” are explored in detail. Levinas's own views on imagination and art are shown to be intimately linked to his critique of Sartrean temporality, insofar as they rely on a renewed phenomenological examination of sensation. As a result, understanding Lévinas’s discussion of the image provides benefits for grasping his notion of the instant and its importance for {{some of his own}} positions vis-à-vis temporality, e. g. on the future and death. The manner in which Lévinas takes issue with Sartre through a phenomenology of the image and and its composition in sensation is first investigated by looking at Lévinas’s novel choice to situate his descriptions of the image with respect to the function and power of art. Nevertheless, despite this crucial decision on Lévinas’s part, departing from earlier phenomenological accounts, there are clear parallels can be drawn between Lévinas’s and Sartre’s descriptions of the image. The similarites and differences between their treatments of the image and the role played therein by the materiality of sensation are then elucidated in terms of the ‘amphiboly’ of the image, distinguishing the image in both its representational and anti-representational characteristics. From there, we proceed to examine the <b>amphiboly</b> of the image according to its temporality attributes, seeing how for Lévinas and Sartre the temporality of the image, as that of an instant, relates to the temporality of consciousness in general...|$|E
40|$|This study {{offers a}} {{reconstructive}} {{account of the}} concept of pure synthesis as it occurs in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. In order to make sense of a pure sensible synthesis, {{it will be necessary to}} provide a detailed account of the transcendental processes that are derived from the subjective sources of the mind prior to any working account of the logical functions ofjudgment. Stated succinct. ~y, our approach will deal with the concept of synthesis from a transcendental 'psycholo'gical perspective. I will argue that a metalevel of transcendental psychology can be uncovered that releases certain functions for concepts of comparison that is different to how Kant stipulates their use in the <b>Amphiboly</b> of Concepts of Reflection section of the Critique. To supplement an account of pure sensible synthesis, I will argue that what I call a 'pure rule of apprehension' or a 'pure rule of synthesis' is constructed out of concepts of comparison and functions as a pure sensible schema. The 'pure rule of apprehension' is modelled on the fundamental action of Kant's Pure Synthesis of Apprehension as it appears in the A Version of the Transcendental Deduction. The rule of synthesis acts as an original schema that can be applied directly to the pl!re manifolds oftime and space prior to objects. It will be argued that the concept of pure sensible synthesis and its accompanying pure sensible schema carry out an ontological function as transcendental elements prior to the reflections carried out by the categories, and prior to the comparisons of empirical representations that first generate concepts of objects. The reconstruction of synthesis and a corresponding schema constitutes the first two main stages of the thesis in Chapters One and Two. This part of the thesis will relate to the area of Kant scholarship that pays particular attention to the subjective sources of the mind, especially the role of the transcendental synthesis of imagination and the determination of intuitions in the Critique. I will subject certain authors to a series of close readings in order to develop the concepts of pure sensible synthesis and a pure sensible schema. In the third and fourth stages of the thesis will move away from the concepts of synthesis and schematism. In Chapter Three I will develop a line of argument that sheds new light on the concept of an object prior to synthesis by examining Kant's Refutation ofIdealism. I will argue that it is possible to conceive of a pure transcendental 'place' or 'location' of a pure object of permanence not mentioned by Kant, by making use of concepts of comparison functioning as pure orientational concepts. In the Fourth Chapter I will round the study off by expounding the central conceptual processes that are at work in the project as a whole, which differ significantly from the way' that Kant employs I' concepts in the first Critique. I will argue that concepts of comparison exhibit functions that are not confined to discursive procedures involved in generating concepts of objects. This completes the thesis. The project starts by examining the concept of synthesis, before moving on to the related theme of schematism. I then deal with the concept of an object, finishing with an examination of the nature of conceptualitx that unifies the project as a whole.
