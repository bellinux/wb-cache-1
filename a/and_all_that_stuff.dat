[...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> which is why I don't know why I asked {{to be in the}} bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Benn {{said in his}} diaries that [...] "Today I had {{the idea}} that I would resign my Privy Councillorship, my MA and all my honorary doctorates in order to strip myself of what the world had to offer". While he {{acknowledged}} that he [...] "might be ridiculed" [...] for doing so, Benn said that [...] "But 'Wedgie Benn' and 'the Rt Honourable Anthony Wedgwood Benn' <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is impossible. I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time." [...] In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to [...] "Tony Benn". Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that [...] "Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie {{in the case of the}} tabloids, for years to come (some older Tories were still doing so three decades later)." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy {{you want to see}} fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E

500|$|Wengren commented, [...] "We {{thought it}} would be pretty cool, {{especially}} for the fans, if we brought back maybe a song or two, that were actually written during the same period that The Sickness songs were written. Danny brought in some old demo tapes, I'm talking twelve years old, back when 'Down With the Sickness' and 'Stupify' , <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> was written, this was actually written before that." [...] The songs that Wengren was referring to were [...] "Perfect Insanity", and [...] "Divide". The band also recorded a version of the song [...] "Midlife Crisis", which was originally performed by Faith No More. Draiman comments, [...] "We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer." [...] However, the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album, and is instead featured on Covered, A Revolution in Sound. This version of [...] "Midlife Crisis" [...] later appeared on The Lost Children, the band's first compilation album.|$|E
500|$|According to the project's lead {{programmer}} Ed Boon, Mortal Kombat II was [...] "intended to {{look different}} than the original MK" [...] and [...] "had everything we wanted to put into MK but {{did not have time}} for." [...] In 2012, Boon placed creating the game among his best Mortal Kombat memories, recalling: [...] "When we did Mortal Kombat II, we got new equipment <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> but it was funny because when we started working on Mortal Kombat II, the mania, the hysteria of the home versions of Mortal Kombat I was literally all around us. We were so busy working on the next one, going from seven characters to 12 and two Fatalities per character and all these other things that that consumed every second." [...] Both the theme and art style of MKII were slightly darker than those of its predecessor, although a more vibrant color palette was employed and the new game had a much richer color depth than the previous game. A new feature was the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling in the arcade version. The game was made to be less serious with the addition of humorous alternative finishing moves.

500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E

2500|$|Atwater: You {{start out}} in 1954 by saying, [...] "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say [...] "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires.

And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E

Cuomo stated that initially the song [...] "started out as a really standard pop song called 'bad girl' and had a verse and a chorus and bridge <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> And I just wasn't satisfied with it. It was too normal. So one day I sat down with my acoustic guitar and I just played [...] song over and over, on basically looping it. My fingers hurt so much, I just kept playing it. And over the hour that I was playing it, the song slowly evolved and it smoothed over and the sections blurred into each other.

2500|$|O'Byrne has {{alleged that}} {{he was asked to}} leave the seminary after he objected to {{incidents}} of anti-Semitism. He later was admitted into Saint Andrew Hall, the Jesuit Novitiate in Syracuse for his primary formation as a Jesuit. After two years, he followed the traditional path to ordination by completing his philosophy studies at Loyola University Chicago, while working at St. Peter's College (New Jersey) where he was assigned by his superiors to work as assistant to the President. He {{was the first person to}} hold that title at St. Peter's. O'Byrne went on to seminary at Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge in 1994, and received two master's degrees. During his studies in Cambridge, he acted as Harvard Law School's chaplain, and worked as a teaching fellow at Harvard University with Robert Coles, the Pulitzer-prize winning author. He was called [...] "brilliant", [...] "determined", and a [...] "hard worker" [...] by several Jesuit priests, and followed the conservatism of Pope John Paul II, with one priest describing him as [...] "being part of the orthodoxy police, theologically, making sure the teachers were really teaching the party line <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> Charles was seen on that part of the culture wars." ...|$|E
