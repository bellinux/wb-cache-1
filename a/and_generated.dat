40|$|This {{report is}} part of a series whose aim is to present in a {{synthetic}} way the major methods of "analytic combinatorics" needed in the average [...] case analysis of algorithms. The series should comprise the following chapters; 1. Symbolic Enumeration <b>and</b> Ordinary <b>Generating</b> Functions; 2. Labelled Structures <b>and</b> Exponential <b>Generating</b> Functions; 3. Parameters <b>and</b> Multivariate <b>Generating</b> Functions; 4. Complex Asymptotic Methods; 5. Singularity Analysis of Generating Functions; 6. Saddle Point Asymptotics; 7. Mellin Transform Asymptotics; 8. Functional Equations <b>and</b> <b>Generating</b> Functions; 9. Multivariate Asymptotics and Combinatorial Distributions. Chapters 1 [...] 3 have been issued as INRIA Research Report 1888 ("The Average Case Analysis of Algorithms: Counting <b>and</b> <b>Generating</b> Functions", 116 pages, 1993). Chapters 4 [...] 5 as INRIA Research Report 2026 ("The Average Case Analysis of Algorithms: Complex Asymptotics <b>and</b> <b>Generating</b> Functions", 100 pages, 1993).

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|As at 2009, Belgrade {{contained}} 31.4% of Serbia's {{employed population}} <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> over 40% of its GDP. The City's nominal GDP in 2014 {{was estimated at}} 16.97 billion USD, amounting to 859,329 RSD ($10,086) per capita. GDP at purchasing power parity was estimated at $36.1bn USD, which was $31,461 per capita in terms of purchasing power parity.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E

50|$|These legends {{date back}} to the time of preurban Latium. Their meaning is quite clear: at the divine level Vulcan impregnates a virgin goddess <b>and</b> <b>generates</b> Jupiter, the king of the gods; at the human level he impregnates a local virgin (perhaps of royal descent) <b>and</b> <b>generates</b> a king.|$|R
5|$|In 1811, {{one of his}} paintings, Telemachus Rescues Antiope {{from the}} Fury of the Wild Boar, was finally {{accepted}} for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour {{and his ability to}} produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> little interest over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, where {{wind power}} has gained very high social acceptance, {{hundreds}} of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> 8% of Germany's electric power.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} week of release, it sold 1.71 million Blu-ray units <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> $48.50 million, topping the weekly Blu-ray chart. However these results were quite skewed due to the one-month delay of its DVD-only release. It sold 3.20 million Blu-ray units ($83.46 million) after 11 weeks. It has also sold 1.12 million DVD units ($19.32 million). Upon its {{television}} premiere on December 29, 2013 in the UK on BBC One, it was watched {{by a total of}} 5.4 million viewers, making it the third-most watched program that night, according to overnight figures.|$|E

5|$|Marquee Moon is the 1977 debut studio album by American {{rock band}} Television. In the years {{leading up to}} the album, the group had become a {{prominent}} act on the New York music scene <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> interest from a number of record labels. Television rehearsed extensively in preparation for Marquee Moon and, after signing to Elektra Records, recorded the album at A & R Recording in September 1976. It was produced by the band's frontman Tom Verlaine and sound engineer Andy Johns.|$|E
5|$|Promotions for the DVD release {{occurred}} {{across the}} United States. The Empire State Building was illuminated yellow, {{the first time}} the building had ever been used as part of a film promotion. In the United Kingdom, Fox launched a £5 million advertising campaign. They also signed a £1.6 million deal with the yogurt company Yoplait, to produce a The Simpsons Movie design for their brand Frubes. In its first week it topped the U.S. DVD chart, <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> $11.8 million in rental revenue.|$|E

5|$|The {{commercial}} {{exploitation of the}} series for the home video market achieved record sales and remained strong over a decade later. The fame of the show has grown through home video sales, which exceeded {{two or three times}} the sales of other contemporary anime series and films. The series contributed significantly to the spread of the DVD format in Japan <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> a considerable impact on the Japanese economy, calculated in billions of yen. A 2007 estimate placed the total value of the franchise at over 150 billion yen.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered on 18 March 1975 to a {{standing}} ovation. Townshend {{was nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

5|$|The {{station was}} heavily {{used for the}} {{transport}} of construction materials during the building of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor in the 1870s and 1880s, but aside from that it saw little use. The station was inconveniently sited and served by few passenger trains, and other more frequently served stations were in easy walking distance. In 1932, the last full year of operations prior to the Metropolitan Railway being taken into public ownership, the station was used for only 281 passenger journeys <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> just £4 of passenger revenue.|$|E
5|$|Until 2009, {{the station}} had two {{operating}} furnace lines, which together {{were capable of}} burning a total of 250,000 tonnes of waste per year, <b>and</b> <b>generated</b> 20MW of electricity. However, in May 2009 a third line was brought into operation. The plant currently burns 360,000 tonnes of waste a year and generates 29.2MW of electricity. This is enough electricity to power 60,000 homes.|$|E

Volcanic activity at La Reforma occurred between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago, and at least four ignimbrites have been found there.|$|E
