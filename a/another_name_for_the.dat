5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E

25|$|The general {{scholarly}} consensus {{since the}} time of Eoin MacNeill has been that the Ulaid were kin to the Érainn, or at least to their royal families, sometimes called the Clanna Dedad, and perhaps not their nebulous subject populations. T. F. O'Rahilly notably believed the Ulaid were an actual branch of the Érainn. Also claimed as being related to the Ulaid are the Dáirine, <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Érainn royalty, both of which may have been related or derived from the Darini of Ptolemy.|$|E

25|$|In 1569 the Union of Lublin {{established}} the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and much Ukrainian territory was transferred from Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, becoming Polish territory de jure. Under the demographic, {{cultural and political}} pressure of Polonisation, {{which began in the}} late 14th century, many landed gentry of Polish Ruthenia (<b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> land of Rus) converted to Catholicism and became indistinguishable from the Polish nobility. Deprived of native protectors among Rus nobility, the commoners (peasants and townspeople) began turning for protection to the emerging Zaporozhian Cossacks, who by the 17th century became devoutly Orthodox. The Cossacks did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies, including the Polish state and its local representatives.|$|E

In 1938 he {{published}} his second work, ארץ צבי (Eretz Tzvi) (the title being <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Land of Israel and {{a play on}} his own name), a book of responsa concerning practical laws in the Shulchan Aruch, section Orach Chaim. This work included his responses to queries from such Torah luminaries as the Gerrer Rebbe. It has been noted for its unique approach to halacha, using non-halakhic and kabbalistic sources to solve halachic problems, and is still widely quoted to this day. Frumer also produced an anonymous pamphlet titled עיקרי דיני תפילה (Main Laws of Prayer), which was widely read in prewar Poland. At the second Siyum HaShas in Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin in June 1938, Frumer initiated the Mishnah Yomit worldwide daily study program, as a complement to the Daf Yomi daily Talmud study program.|$|E
25|$|At this juncture, Clive faced a dilemma. The Nawab had {{reconciled}} with Mir Jafar and had posted him on one flank of his army. Mir Jafar had sent messages to Clive, declaring {{his intention to}} uphold the treaty between them. Clive decided to refer the problem to his officers and held a council of war on 21 June. The question Clive put before them was whether, under the present circumstances, the army, without other assistance, should immediately cross into the island of Cossimbazar and attack the Nawab or whether they should fortify their position in Katwa and trust to assistance from the Marathas or other Indian powers. Of the twenty officers attending the council, thirteen including Clive were against immediate action, while the rest including Major Coote were in favour citing recent success and the high spirits of the troops. The council broke up and {{after an hour of}} deliberation, Clive gave the army orders to cross the Bhagirathi River (<b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hooghly River) on the morning of 22 June.|$|E
25|$|The Chancery Wing is <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{northwest}} {{wing of the}} palace. It {{was planned}} for the central parts of the government administration, the Royal chancery. The wing was finished by architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and was originally used as the royal gardhouse, offices for domestic, foreign and war departments {{as well as the}} National Archives of Sweden. As the government administration grew, it moved from the palace and formed new independent departments, and around 1780, the Chancery Wing was transformed into an apartment for the three-year-old Crown Prince Gustav (IV) Adolf and later for his mother the Queen Dowager Sophia Magdalena. The Chancery Wing was once again the home of a prince in 1905, when it became the Crown Prince and later King Gustaf VI Adolf, who used it as his private lodgings until his death in 1973. A part of the mezzanine floor above his apartment was converted into his private library in the 1930s. The Spegelsalongen (the Mirror Hall), updated in 1866 by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, is in the wing as well as a Green and a Blue Drawing room. The Slottsarkivet, a part of the present National Archives of Sweden, is still in the cellars of the wing.|$|E
