40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanisms}} underlying the natural tolerance of thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes for self-antigens. Lymphocytes from the thymus or lymph nodes of inbred rats were autosensitized in vitro against monolayers of autochthonous thymus reticulum cells or syngeneic fibroblasts. Receptors for self-antigens were detected by the specific adherence of normal lymphocytes to syngeneic cells. The achievement of active cell-mediated <b>autosensitization</b> was assayed {{by measuring the}} immunospecific lysis of syngeneic target cells in vitro, or graft-versus-host (GvH) reactions in vivo. The following observations were made using these systems. (a) A fraction of normal lymphocytes {{was found to have}} specific surface receptors that are able to recognize self-antigens which seem to be accessible in vivo. These potentially self-reactive lymphocytes were activated by incubation with syngeneic or autochthonous cells in vitro. Hence, the elimination of potentially self-reactive lymphocytes cannot be the only basis for natural self-tolerance. Therefore, the maintenance of self-tolerance in vivo appears to involve suppression of the immune reactivity of such self-tolerant lymphocytes. (b) We found that control of <b>autosensitization</b> depends upon the inhibition of the recognition of self-antigens. A GvH reaction in vivo could not be suppressed once recognition of self-antigens had occurred in vitro. Moreover, studies of the kinetics of antigen recognition indicated that several hours of incubation in vitro were needed for the inactivation of factors specifically inhibiting self-recognition. (c) We found that factors which inhibit self-recognition are present in fresh autologous serum. Treatment of the lymphocytes, but not syngeneic adsorbing cells, with autologous serum prevented recognition of syngeneic antigens. Allogeneic serum did not prevent self-recognition, and autologous serum did not inhibit the recognition of foreign antigens. These findings indicate that natural tolerance of T lymphocytes to self-antigens can be regulated by serum factors which act on the lymphocytes.

40|$|A {{central role}} of the thymus in <b>autosensitization</b> to the {{acetylcholine}} receptor has been proposed to explain the immunopathogenetic processes in myasthenia gravis (MG). Two isoforms of the alpha-subunit of the acetylcholine receptor are known; they differ by a 25 -amino-acid insertion coded by the P 3 A exon. We investigated {{the expression of the}} P 3 A exon by RNA polymerase chain reaction in fetal and adult human myoblasts and TE 671 cells; both isoforms were expressed. Muscle biopsies from patients with MG, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and polymyositis were also studied and it was again found that both isoforms were expressed, indicating that the P 3 A exon is not associated with autoimmune, degenerative, and inflammatory muscle diseases. When P 3 A expression was studied in thymus samples from normal subjects and from thymectomized MG patients, the P 3 A+ subunit was absent in 75 % of patients with involuted thymus and in all patients with thymomas but was present in normal thymuses and in patients with hyperplasia.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to quantitate immunohistological {{changes in the}} myasthenia gravis (MG) thymus and to correlate them with clinical and culture parameters in 40 untreated young onset patients covering {{a wide range of}} durations and serum anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers. Total cellularities of both the thymic cortex and the medulla declined significantly with age. There was some hyperplasia of subcapsular and of medullary epithelial cells, often at the expense of cortex. A combined index of all hyperplastic changes correlated significantly with serum anti-AChR titre. Otherwise histological indices, e. g. of germinal centres (GC) were largely unrelated to any clinical parameters, especially duration of symptoms. Specific anti-AChR synthesis in culture (very closely related to serum titer) correlated better with the medullary lymph node-type T-cell areas; these were more widely prevalent and MG-specific. In contrast, basal and mitogen-stimulated total IgG productivity followed the GC indices more closely. We propose that the variability of GC is due to their dependence on extraneous immune complexes, and we discuss whether they or the T-cell areas are primary or secondary abnormalities.

40|$|To {{study the}} role of the thymus in the {{cellular}} pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis (MG) we transplanted thymus tissue fragments from MG thymuses beneath the kidney capsule of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Immunocytochemical studies documented that the human thymus tissues are accepted as long-term grafts in the host SCID mice, with human lymphocytes, thymic stroma, and thymic myoid cells demonstrable in transplanted thymus for at least 15 weeks after transplantation. Human anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies became detectable 1 to 2 weeks after transplantation, and in most chimeras the titers increased over at least 11 weeks to reach levels typically found in severe human MG. Human Ig deposits were detected at skeletal muscle end-plates, demonstrating that the human (auto) antibodies bound to murine acetylcholine receptor. In contrast, transfers of dissociated thymus cells only lead to a transient increase of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Our data prove that myasthenia gravis thymus is able to induce and maintain autoantibody production in immunodeprived host animals, and that this tissue contains all cellular components required for autoantibody production.

This behavior contrasts sharply with the specificity of the antibodies which are later formed in the serum and which react indifferently in vitro with all protein conjugates of the same hapten, provided the number of hapten groups is adequate and their linkage to the protein carrier is similar. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as Arthus or passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA), t which are mediated by serum antibodies show an immunological specificity also limited to the haptens and a complete lack of protein carrier specificity (3).

40|$|<b>Autosensitization</b> of rat or mouse {{lymphoid cells}} against syngeneic {{fibroblast}} antigens was induced in cell culture. Rat lymphoid cells autosensitized by this method {{were able to}} produce immunospecific lysis of syngeneic target fibroblasts in vitro or GvH reactions in newborn rats. Autosensitized mouse spleen cells mediated similar GvH reactions when injected into newborn mice. The nature of the system used to induce immunity in vitro appears to argue against the possibility that lymphocytes capable of reacting against self-antigens could arise by mutation in cell culture. Hence, {{it is likely that}} cells potentially reactive against self-antigens preexisted in the lymphoid cell donors. The ability of autosensitized cells to mediate immune reactions in vivo suggests that the immunogenic self-antigens present on sensitizing fibroblasts also were accessible in the intact animals. Loss of natural self-tolerance in vitro, therefore, can be explained most simply by the existence of lymphocytes which are reversibly tolerant to self. Hence, ontogenic elimination of potentially self-reactive cells may not be the only basis for natural tolerance. Regulatory mechanisms, such as antigen excess, may have to function in vivo to prevent differentiation of self-tolerant lymphocytes. These regulatory mechanisms appear to be annulled in the cell-culture system. The present system thus may offer a new approach to studies of tolerance and regulation of cellular immunity...|$|E

In view of findings that the innate immune system can generate an autoimmune response, we studied the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 to 5, key components of innate immunity signaling pathways, in 37 thymuses from patients with autoimmune MG. TLR 4 mRNA levels were significantly greater in thymitis (hyperplasia with diffuse B-cell infiltration) and involuted thymus than in germinal center hyperplasia and thymoma. By immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, cells positive for TLR 4 protein were rarely detected in thymoma. However, in thymitis TLR 4 protein was mostly found on epitheliomorphic (cytokeratin-positive) cells located in close association with clusters of acetylcholine receptor-positive myoid cells in thymic medulla and also at the borders between cortical and medullary areas. B cells were never TLR 4 -positive. TLR 4 protein was also present in remnant tissue of involuted thymus. This is the first finding of a possible link between innate immunity and MG.

40|$|Myasthenia gravis is a {{human disease}} caused by an {{autoimmune}} response against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR). Since the molecular structure of AcChoR is well known, myasthenia gravis is an excellent system for studying the recognition of a complex membrane antigen in the human immune system. Human T-helper (TH) cell lines reactive to the AcChoR were isolated from four myasthenic patients by selection with native AcChoR from Torpedo californica. The selected TH cells could efficiently recognize native and fully denatured AcChoR. The {{vast majority of the}} TH-stimulating AcChoR epitopes were located on the denatured alpha subunit of AcChoR. Antibody competition experiments using a panel of rat anti-AcChoR monoclonal antibodies showed that 39 - 45 % of the autoantibodies present in the sera of these same patients bound to the conformation-sensitive "main immunogenic region" (MIR), also located on the alpha subunit. However, AcChoR-induced stimulation of the T cells could not be inhibited with up to 20 -fold molar excess of different rat anti-MIR monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that the Torpedo AcChoR alpha subunit contains conformation-insensitive epitopes that {{play a role in the}} <b>autosensitization</b> of TH cells and that seem to be physically separated from the MIR.

Appearance of EAP was noticed in the three lobes of the prostate, most frequently and severely in the anterior lobe (coagulating gland). EAP thus induced was characterized by a loss of secretory products in the lumen, massive lymphocytic infiltration in the stroma, especially beneath the epithelial cells, and {{by the presence of}} circulating autoantibody(ies) against the epithelial cells of the prostate (APA). EAP started at puberty and its incidence was 68 % in 50 - 150 day old mice. APA was completely absorbed with the homogenates of prostate but not of seminal vesicles, testes or livers of the mouse.

40|$|The role of antigen {{expression}} by thymomas in {{myasthenia gravis}} (MG) is not clear. Previous reports of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) mRNA expression by the highly sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) produced varying results. To try to clarify this issue, we first used RT-PCR but {{then turned to}} the more accurate and quantitative RNase protection assays (RPA) to assess AChR subunit mRNA expression in thymomas from 25 patients (22 with MG). By RT-PCR, all five AChR subunits could be detected in many thymomas. However, by RPA, the mRNA for the adult-specific AChR epsilon-subunit was found in 13 / 25 (52 %) thymomas, but not mRNA for the other subunits. AChR epsilon-subunit was more frequently detected in thymomas of A or AB histology (WHO classification) than those with B 1 -B 3 histology. Overall, 6 / 6 with thymomas of A or AB histology were positive compared with only 8 / 19 with B histology (p= 0. 02). Autoantibodies in the two patients with the highest levels of epsilon-subunit mRNA bound better to adult (alpha(2) betadeltaepsilon) AChR than to fetal (alpha(2) betadeltagamma) AChR, whereas the other sera bound better to fetal AChR.

Another antibody, RFD 4, also labeled the subcapsular epithelium in childhood and adults, but not fetal samples. The samples from MG cases showed the same staining pattern as adult control samples. The medullary epithelium was also RFD 4 +, and at all ages. The most striking {{changes in the}} advanced cases of MG were the unusual arrangement and hypertrophic appearance of medullary epithelial cell areas, separated by laminin-positive basement membranes from the alternating multiple bands of peripheral lymph-node-like areas.

These T-cell zones were unique to the thymus in MG and were absent in the two normal thymic samples with isolated GCs. In MG the laminin-containing basement membrane, which separated the medullary epithelial and peripheral lymph-node-like areas, was fenestrated at circumscribed points closest to the GCs, thus apparently permitting communication among the medullary epithelium, the T-cell zones, the GCs and the associated antigen-presenting cells.

Many of the immunologic changes produced by homologous organs {{have been shown to be}} organ-specific rather than species-specific; i. e., the changes observed have been directed towards the particular organ employed as allergen, more or less regardless of the species from which the organ originated. The aggregate of this work has suggested that, under certain conditions, individuals may become sensitized to the slightly denatured substances of their own organs; and that organ-specific antibodies may thus be produced; and that these antibodies may, in turn, damage the particular organ or organs in v/vo and in situ, and may thus produce clinical disease. Some examples of homologous and autogenous organ-specific sensitization can be cited in the work of Burky (1) and of Swift and Schultz (2) employing the crystalline lens, and of Schwentker and Rivers (3) employing the brain and cord. This work together with that of Masugi (4) and of Smadel and Swift (5) with kidney, and of Rivers and Schwentker (6), and of others, has shown that in experimental animals the organ-specific antibodies can, in all probability, produce disease in the particular organ or organs concerned...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} thymocyte and thymic regulatory T cell (CD 4 SPCD 25 +Foxp 3 +cells, Treg) {{development in}} thymoma {{with and without}} myasthenia gravis (MG, MG-thymoma, non-MG-thymoma) and in MG-associated non-neoplastic thymus (MG-NNT). An increased number of immature CD 4 +CD 8 (-) CD 3 (-) thymocytes through the CD 4 +CD 8 + to CD 4 +CD 8 (-) transition and an abnormal T cell receptor Vbeta (TCRVbeta) development through the CD 4 +CD 8 + to CD 4 (-) CD 8 + transition were seen both in MG-and non-MG-thymomas. Terminal thymopoiesis, i. e., CD 45 RA+ cells within the CD 4 +CD 8 (-) CD 3 + and CD 8 +CD 4 (-) CD 3 + subsets, was skewed towards the CD 4 + compartment in MG-thymoma and CD 8 + compartment in non-MG-thymoma, but thymic export was increased only in the latter {{in keeping with the}} hypothesis that CD 8 + lymphocytes {{may play a role in}} the initial stages of <b>autosensitization</b> and in disagreement with the relevance of an increased output of CD 4 + T lymphocytes in paraneoplastic MG. Treg level in normal thymus and MG-NNT and both MG- and non-MG-thymoma was similar, and TCRVbeta development in Treg cells was slightly altered in thymoma but irrespective of MG presence. Thus, the relevance of a defective Treg development in MG context remains to be established. Most alterations in thymopoiesis were corrected by therapeutic corticosteroid administration, and the effects of steroid administration may be mediated by thymic microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|When {{capsaicin}} {{is applied}} repeatedly to {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) neurons for brief periods (10 – 15 s) at short intervals (5 – 10 min), the evoked responses rapidly decline, a phenomenon termed tachyphylaxis. In addition to this phenomenon, the present study using Ca 2 + imaging revealed that repeated application of capsaicin to rat dissociated DRG neurons at longer intervals (20 – 40 min) or during multiple applications at short intervals elicited an enhancement of the responses, termed potentiation. The potentiation occurred in 50 – 60 % of the capsaicin-responsive cells, on average representing a 20 - to 30 % increase in the peak amplitude of the Ca 2 + signal, and was maximal at a 40 -min application interval. An analysis of the mechanisms underlying potentiation revealed that it was suppressed by block of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) with 5 μM KN- 93 or block of the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 with 2 μM U- 0126. Lowering the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration from 2 to 1 mM or pretreatment with deltamethrin (1 μM), which blocks calcineurin and tachyphylaxis, enhanced potentiation. Potentiation was not affected by: 1) inhibition of protein kinase C or protein kinase A, 2) block of the three subtypes of neurokinin receptors, or 3) block of the trafficking of transient receptor potential V 1 channel to the membrane. These {{results indicate that the}} potentiation is a slowly developing Ca 2 +-modulated process that is mediated by a complex intracellular signaling pathway involving activation of CaMKII and ERK 1 / 2. Potentiation may be an important peripheral <b>autosensitization</b> mechanism that occurs independently of the pronociceptive effects of inflammatory mediators and neurotrophic factors...|$|E
