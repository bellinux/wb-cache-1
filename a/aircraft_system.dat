25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the United States Army began forming {{requirements}} for a helicopter {{to replace the}} UH-1 Iroquois, and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport <b>Aircraft</b> <b>System</b> (UTTAS). The Army also initiated {{the development of a}} new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the General Electric T700. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant. The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972. The RFP also included air transport requirements. Transport aboard the C-130 limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.|$|E

In February 1962, approval of the overall configuration was given and was followed by a development contract in October 1962.
