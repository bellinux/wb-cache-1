50|$|Triton and {{his daughters}} notice {{a change in}} Ariel, who is openly lovesick. Triton {{questions}} Sebastian about Ariel's behavior, during which Sebastian accidentally reveals the incident with Eric. Triton furiously confronts Ariel in her grotto, using his trident to destroy her collection of human treasures. After Triton leaves, a pair of eels, Flotsam and Jetsam, convince a crying Ariel that she must visit Ursula the sea witch, if she wants all of her dreams to come true. Ursula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the 'kiss of true love' from Eric; otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid {{on the third day}} and belong to Ursula. <b>As</b> <b>payment</b> for <b>legs,</b> Ariel has to give up her voice, which Ursula takes by magically removing the energy from Ariel's vocal cords and storing it in a nautilus shell.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{effects of}} the 2007 - 08 {{financial}} crisis {{have resulted in a}} sharp change in the way interest rate markets are viewed as well as modelled. As a result of the crisis, the general market framework has transitioned from a single curve framework to what is commonly known as the 'multiple-curve' framework. In addition to this, there is debate as to which curve to use for discounting. This dissertation will initially aim to give a succinct, yet thorough overview of the changes affecting interest rate modelling {{as a result of the}} financial crisis. In particular pricing methods that are consistent with the multi-curve framework are presented. Adaptations of the popular Libor Market Model (LMM) and Stochastic Alpha-Beta-Rho (SABR) consistent with the new market framework are also presented. The second aim of the dissertation is to outline and implement methods of transforming volatilities within this new market framework. The market quotes available for caps/floors and swaptions often assume <b>a</b> particular <b>payment</b> tenor, for example swaption volatilities are typically quoted assuming <b>payment</b> <b>legs</b> of six months. As such, if one wanted to price an identical swaption based on <b>payment</b> <b>legs</b> of three months, or even monthly payments, some form of transformation is needed. The methods presented and implemented are largely based on the work of Kienitz (2013). The methods described are implemented to transform six month cap and swaption volatility surfaces to three month surfaces...|$|R

50|$|A Zero {{coupon swap}} (ZCS) is a {{derivative}} contract made between two parties with terms defining two 'legs' upon which each party either makes or receives <b>payments.</b> One <b>leg</b> {{is the traditional}} fixed leg, whose cashflows are determined at the outset, usually defined by an agreed fixed rate of interest. A second leg is the traditional floating <b>leg,</b> whose <b>payments</b> at the outset are forecast but subject to change and dependent upon future publication of the interest rate index upon which the leg is benchmarked. This is same description as with the more common interest rate swap (IRS). A ZCS differs from an IRS in one major respect; timings of scheduled <b>payments.</b> <b>A</b> ZCS {{takes its name from}} a zero coupon bond which has no interim coupon <b>payments</b> and only <b>a</b> single <b>payment</b> at maturity. <b>A</b> ZCS, unlike an IRS, also only has <b>a</b> single <b>payment</b> date on each leg at the maturity of the trade. The calculation methodology for determing <b>payments</b> is, as <b>a</b> result, slightly more complicated than for IRSs.|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} {{queueing}} problems is introduced {{in which each}} customer can purchase preferential treatment by making <b>a</b> <b>payment.</b> Each customer is assumed to select his payment so as to minimize his own expected cost, without regard for global considerations. <b>A</b> <b>payment</b> policy determines <b>a</b> customer's <b>payment</b> as <b>a</b> function of the information available. <b>A</b> <b>payment</b> policy {{is said to be}} stable if no one customer can reduce his expected cost by deviating from it, provided that all other customers follow it.

5000|$|The {{acceptance}} of <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation.

A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge <b>payment</b> by producing <b>a</b> receipt to the payer. A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as [...] "paid in full".

5000|$|In some instances, a debt {{collector}} {{will attempt to}} revive a debt that has expired due to {{the statute of limitations}} by themselves making <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> on the debt, [...] "to re-age the account in order to have more time to collect". Such <b>a</b> <b>payment,</b> usually in <b>a</b> relatively small amount, may appear on a credit card statement as an [...] "agency payment" [...] or [...] "transactional payment", and may also be referred to as a [...] "phantom payment" [...] since it is made by the collection agency, without the knowledge or permission of the debtor. Because this payment is not made by the debtor, <b>an</b> agency <b>payment</b> does not extend the statute of limitations beyond the last date when the debtor personally made <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> on the debt, and will be disregarded by the courts, absent evidence showing the payment method used and connecting this to the debtor. If such <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> is represented as <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> by the debtor without such evidence, this representation constitutes a fraud on the court, and it is advised that such an activity be reported to the [...] "FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection or your state attorney general".|$|R

5000|$|Some {{states have}} added an {{additional}} level of complexity to the interest calculation problem by providing {{what amounts to}} a front end interest free loan {{for a period of time}} after <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> falls due.
