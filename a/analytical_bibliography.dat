50|$|Annotations may {{be written}} with {{different}} goals in mind. There are {{three types of}} annotations, depending on what might be most important for your reader or according to your professor’s instructions.It is impossible to describe a standard procedure {{for all types of}} annotations because one annotation does not fit all purposes. In order to know the best type of annotation, it is prudent to consult your instructor or follow the instructions. For example, if the assignment states that your annotative bibliography should give evidence proving an analytical understanding of the sources you have used, then you are supposed to write an <b>analytical</b> annotated <b>bibliography</b> which includes evaluation of the sources you are using. The three types of annotated bibliographies are; summary annotations, critical annotations and a combination of the former two.|$|R
50|$|Bibliographic works {{differ in}} the amount of detail {{depending}} on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of publications in a particular category and <b>analytical</b> or critical <b>bibliography,</b> which studies the production of books. In earlier times, bibliography mostly focused on books. Now, both categories of bibliography cover works in other media including audio recordings, motion pictures and videos, graphic objects, databases, CD-ROMs and websites.|$|R

40|$|The Argentine {{standard}} {{for the construction of}} monolingual thesaurus (IRAM 32057 : 1983) was compared with the last editions of the international standard (ISO 2788 : 1986), and the national standards of Spain (UNE 50106 : 1990), United States (Z 39. 19 : 2005), and Great Britain (BSI 8723 - 2 : 2005 b), and very well known manuals. The scope and formal issues were analyzed, as well as the conceptual issues for controlled vocabulary. The scope of the Argentine standard is limited to the construction of monolingual thesauri, while the new North-American and British standards also cover different knowledge organization systems. In relation to the formal issues, the Argentine standard has not table of content, <b>analytical</b> index, glossary, <b>bibliography</b> and some sections and annexes, having very few examples. In reference to conceptual issues, some definitions are incorrect or outdated, as well as some recommendations for vocabulary control. We conclude that the Argentine standards should be reviewed and updated in agreement to the recently published standards, and the ISO 25964 standard, still in preparation...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} medium signifies. Any document type within any medium offers a semiotic setting of its own, a particular document architecture [1]. Every transmission {{of a literary}} work affects its text [2] due to the particular media used and the choices made by the individual transmitter. Certain features of the textual work that can be expressed within the new architecture and its web of signs are preserved, while others are treated as noise, obscuring the essential text signals. This certainly holds true for the current transition of text: with each digitisation certain particulars of both the work and the tool are emphasised {{at the expense of}} others, and there is always some collision between different document architectures [3]. Furthermore, as any McLuhan student knows, a new media form poses as the old medium by imitating its very form. Any bibliological study will tell how the first printed books, known as the incunables, well into the 16 th century tried to fit a previous medial expression into the economy of the new, and thereby did their best to pose as handwritten, illuminated manuscripts [4]. Such collisions and transitions have, to some extent, been studied within disciplines such as book history, editorial theory, textual criticism, and <b>analytical</b> and historical <b>bibliography.</b> One would therefore welcome more intense cooperative efforts between the currently "sexy" market of electronic publishing and the perhaps not-so-sexy competence of the latter disciplines...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis has grown out of an extensive survey of the literature pertaining to the county of Rutland. The survey was an original idea to produce a county bibliography which had both a short-title catalogue of conventional references and full physical descriptions of the books of the county. Two types of <b>bibliography,</b> <b>analytical</b> and systematic, are combined in one survey. The thesis is an account of this project together with a rigorous review of the theoretical background against which it was conducted. The practice of bibliography, and specifically of bibliographies of counties, is reviewed. A new definition of county bibliography is offered, together with its appropriate objects of study (book, pamphlet, leaflet, ephemera and publication {{are some of the}} specific concepts defined here). The research methods employed for the Rutland project are described and a plan outlined showing how a comprehensive survey of any English county's literature could be achieved. Especially important here are the lessons learned from on-line searching. There is a detailed discussion of inclusion and exclusion policies appropriate for a county bibliography, and an account of how this material should be presented and described. A new classification system for a county bibliography is outlined, and older solutions to the classification problem reviewed. The lessons of the Rutland project are discussed, including presentation of a statistical breakdown of the Rutland material, and whether {{the way in which the}} Rutland project was conducted could be copied for other counties. The Rutland statistics are contrasted with those for other counties. Several appendices present bibliographical information, lists of categories of literature encountered and samples from the Rutland survey...|$|R

Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, <b>analytical</b> <b>bibliography</b> or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.|$|E
5000|$|This {{branch of}} the bibliographic {{discipline}} examines the material features of a textual artifact - such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book - to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. <b>Analytical</b> <b>bibliography</b> often uses collateral evidence - such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc. - to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence {{in the form of}} a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography. Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, binding, and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations - and the aetiology of variations - in a text with a view to determining [...] "the establishment of the most correct form of a text (Bowers 4981).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to extract as much {{information}} as possible from the early quartos of George Chapman's twelve plays by the various methods which <b>analytical</b> <b>bibliography</b> has recently developed, and to present the results {{in such a way as}} to be useful to a prospective editor of the plays. The present work, which has involved an entirely fresh examination of all the quartos, is an original contribution to Chapman studies, but it should also make a general contribution to <b>analytical</b> <b>bibliography</b> with special reference to Elizabethan and Jacobean printed plays. The main body of the present thesis comprises an introduction with a bibliographical description of the play studied; four chapters on, respectively, the nature of the printer's copy, variants, compositorial analyses, and on the characteristics of compositors; and a brief general conclusion. Appendices include bibliographical notes on the Chapman quartos. A bibliography has been provided at the end of the thesis...|$|E
