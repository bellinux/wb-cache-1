5|$|As {{part of the}} Mycenaean {{heritage}} that survived, {{the names}} of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity.

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} prefers {{open country}} where weeds thrive, such as fields, meadows, flood plains, {{as well as}} roadsides, orchards, and gardens.

5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs {{are also found}} in mountains and spruce taiga. In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> dry grassland and woods.|$|E
5|$|The grape {{originated}} in France, {{in the regions}} of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley. Plantings in California, Australia, Chile and South Africa are also extensive, and Sauvignon blanc is steadily increasing in popularity as white wine drinkers seek alternatives to Chardonnay.

5|$|This {{species is}} found {{throughout}} Taiwan (including the Archipelagos of Matsu and Kinmen), {{in the central}} and southern regions of mainland China (in the provinces of Hainan, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian), Hong Kong, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, and northern Vietnam.

5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species {{is found in the}} eastern states of Australia, mostly on the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures. They can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E

5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the mineral world, {{most of them}} being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of}} the smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E

5|$|In Asia, Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is found}} in Turkey. It can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Iran, in the provinces of Kerman, Gilan, Mazandaran, Fars, Hormozgan, Lorestan and Khorasan. However, until 2012, all the records from Iran were listed as Theodoxus doriae. In Africa this species occurs in Algeria, and {{possibly}} (or probably) in Morocco, where there are records which some authors consider to be reliable. However, instead of one species, Theodoxus fluviatilis, Brown (1994) recognized three species in northwestern Africa: Theodoxus numidicus, Theodoxus maresi, Theodoxus meridionalis.|$|E
5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> central Asia and China. In Russia {{it may be}} found in the tundra zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it is rare in one district, endangered in another.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation.|$|E
