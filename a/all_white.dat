5|$|After its {{game against}} Northwestern, Michigan {{traveled}} to East Lansing to battle their in-state rival, the Michigan State Spartans, for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Michigan {{was searching for}} its first win against Michigan State since 2007. Michigan State won the previous meeting 34–17. The Wolverines wore legacy road uniforms for the game with Michigan State, which were the road version of the uniform worn against Notre Dame. It {{was the first time}} that Michigan wore <b>all</b> <b>white</b> road uniforms since the 1976 Orange Bowl against Oklahoma. Michigan State also wore special alternate uniforms colored dark green, bronze and black.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata, {{commonly}} known as the death angel, destroying angel, angel of death or more precisely western North American destroying angel, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Occurring in the Pacific Northwest and California floristic provinces of North America, A. ocreata associates with oak trees. The large fruiting bodies (the mushrooms) generally appear in spring; the cap may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the stipe, ring, gill and volva are <b>all</b> <b>white.</b>|$|E
50|$|Utting {{has played}} for the New Zealand {{national}} soccer team, the <b>All</b> <b>Whites.</b> Since making his debut for the <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> in 1991, he had rarely been a substitute goalkeeper, until 1999, when his career was marred by alcoholism.|$|R
5000|$|Tzimopoulos {{was called}} into the <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> squad for a 31 March {{friendly}} in Seoul against South Korea by coach Anthony Hudson. Tzimopoulos is eligible for the <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> through his family heritage. “Every professional player dreams to play international football so it’s an honour for me {{to play for the}} <b>All</b> <b>Whites.</b> It will be a great challenge for me to play at a higher level and to meet the requirements of the team.”, he said.|$|R
50|$|Hay {{appeared}} for the New Zealand {{national football}} team, the <b>All</b> <b>Whites.</b> His first goal {{for his country}} came against Fiji in the 1998 Oceania Nations Cup in a 1-0 win. In 2006, Hay was awarded the captaincy of the <b>All</b> <b>Whites.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, public defender Blane Williams had urged Bell {{to accept a}} plea bargain. At trial he rested the defense case without calling any {{witnesses}} or offering any evidence. The six members of Bell's jury were <b>all</b> <b>white.</b> The 150-person jury pool included black citizens, who make up 10percent of the parish's population, {{but none of the}} 50potential jurors who showed up was black. Williams did not challenge the composition of the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly <b>all</b> <b>white</b> Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and <b>all</b> <b>white</b> lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
50|$|Clifton <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> {{was founded}} in 1963, {{originally}} {{under the name of}} Thistledown Rovers. The club's founder members included Dick Lambert and Bill Norwell. During the 1960s and 1970s Clifton <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> dominated youth football in Nottinghamshire by attracting the best players from all over the county, now most players are local. In 1963 there were only four teams in the Young Elizabethan League, and as the club developed, more teams and clubs were founded, many with advice and help from Clifton <b>All</b> <b>Whites.</b> By 1966 plans were underway for Clifton <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> to test their skills abroad in a tournament in the Netherlands, at a time when overseas tours were rare. In the early days when football clubs only usually supplied shirts for their players a new standard was set as Clifton <b>All</b> <b>Whites</b> supplied a full strip. Another first was when the under 12's played a top Scottish team before a crowd of over 20,000 before a First Division match between Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United.|$|R

50|$|The New Zealand Under 20's {{football}} (soccer) team, {{more commonly}} known as the Junior <b>All</b> <b>Whites,</b> is controlled by New Zealand Football and represents New Zealand in international Under 20 or youth football competitions.

5|$|Liverpool fielded a 4–4–1–1 formation, {{with the}} {{surprise}} {{inclusion in the}} squad being Harry Kewell, who played just behind Milan Baroš, who himself had been picked ahead of Djibril Cissé. The inclusion of Kewell meant Dietmar Hamann was left on the substitutes' bench and Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard started in the centre of midfield. Milan fielded a 4–4–2 diamond formation, with Hernán Crespo preferred to Jon Dahl Tomasson and Filippo Inzaghi, who {{was not included in}} the match day squad. Liverpool lined up in their red home kit, whilst Milan wore a changed strip of <b>all</b> <b>white.</b> Liverpool won the toss and kicked off.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{clinched}} {{the gold medal}} after defeating Japan 2–1 at Wembley Stadium in front of 80,203 spectators – the largest crowd ever for a women's Olympic soccer game. Rapinoe assisted on Carli Lloyd's second goal of the final in the 53rd minute. She ended the tournament with three goals and a team-high of four assists (tied with Alex Morgan). Widely {{regarded as one of}} the top players of the Olympics, Rapinoe was named to numerous 'Team of the Tournament' lists including those selected by the BBC and <b>All</b> <b>White</b> Kit.|$|E
5|$|Wearing either {{all black}} or <b>all</b> <b>white</b> dresses ordered from Paris, Marrash hosted the mixed evening get-togethers in which {{literary}} topics {{as varied as}} the Mu`allaqat—a cycle of seven pre-Islamic poems—or the work of Rabelais were discussed. Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and 'araq flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph.|$|E

5|$|By late 1916, most {{settlers}} in the colony who were inclined to volunteer had already done so. To free up white manpower, some suggested the recruitment of older men for local service so more of the younger volunteers could go overseas. In 1917, the Chartered Company set up a committee to consider the question of national defence both {{during the war and}} thereafter; its report, released in February 1918, described reliance on volunteers as inefficient, and recommended the institution of compulsory service for whites, even after the war (no mention was made of using black troops in the future). The Company published proposals the following month to register <b>all</b> <b>white</b> males aged between 18 and 65 with a view to some form of conscription, but this provoked widespread and vocal dissent, particularly from farmers. In the face of this opposition the administration vacillated until it quietly dropped the idea after the armistice.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or <b>all</b> <b>white</b> with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because <b>all</b> <b>white</b> visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was {{compounded by the fact that}} Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>all</b> <b>white</b> {{males in}} New Hampshire {{between the ages}} of 18 and 45, Pierce {{was a member of the}} state militia, and was {{appointed}} aide de camp to Governor Samuel Dinsmoor in 1831. He remained in the militia until 1847, and attained the rank of colonel before becoming a brigadier general in the Army during the Mexican–American War. Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias, which had become increasingly dormant during the years of peace following the War of 1812, Pierce worked with Alden Partridge, president of Norwich University, a military college in Vermont, and Truman B. Ransom and Alonzo Jackman, Norwich faculty members and militia officers, to increase recruiting efforts and improve training and readiness. Pierce served as a Norwich University trustee from 1841 to 1859, and received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Norwich in 1853.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the video is shot in black-and-white, and shows Derulo sitting {{on the hood of}} a corvette outside a Malibu mansion dressed in 1920s attire. In another scene, Derulo is seen dancing at an area of the mansion which is surrounded by trees. The video then shows intercut scenes in full color of Derulo at the beach, on the mansion's balcony, and in the bedroom with his love interest (played by Tika Sumpter). More scenes in full color, show Derulo on the balcony interacting with her, and also shows him singing to her in the bedroom using a microphone. During another scene, Derulo is seen dressed in <b>all</b> <b>white.</b> The video ends with a kissing scene between the two which then fades away.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are <b>all</b> <b>white</b> pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are <b>all</b> <b>white.</b> Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|With the {{transfer}} of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new Zimbabwe National Army. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were mixed into new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the Rhodesian Air Force, for example, remained almost <b>all</b> <b>white</b> as the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Every one of the approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised {{a place in the}} new army. In the meantime they would wait in respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black privates in the old Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} capture of Schuckmannsburg in the Caprivi Strip by a {{combined}} force of BSAP and Northern Rhodesia Police on 21 September 1914, the British South Africa Company's own armed forces and police remained almost totally uninvolved in the war until the following month. The South African Prime Minister, the former Boer general Louis Botha, had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South-West Africa without help, so the Imperial garrison {{had been sent to}} the Western Front. Lieutenant-Colonel Manie Maritz—an ex-Boer commander who now headed a column of Afrikaans-speaking Union troops—defected to the Germans in mid-September, hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old Boer Republics. Botha requested the 500-man column that the Chartered Company had raised, hoping to reduce the possibility of further defections by interspersing his own forces with firmly pro-British Rhodesians. The expeditionary force was promptly formalised in Salisbury, and named the 1st Rhodesia Regiment after the unit of Southern Rhodesian volunteers that had fought in the Anglo-Boer War. Apart from a small contingent of Matabele (or Ndebele) scouts, the unit was <b>all</b> <b>white.</b>|$|E
