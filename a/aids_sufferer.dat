5000|$|Richard Schickel of Time criticized its simplistic characterization, saying, [...] "Watching The Hours, {{one finds}} oneself {{focusing}} excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects {{in order to}} look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer." [...] He also criticized its overt politicization: [...] "But this movie {{is in love with}} female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an <b>AIDS</b> <b>sufferer</b> whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? The same criticisms might apply to the fact that both these fictional characters (and, it is hinted, Woolf herself) find what consolation they can in a rather dispassionate lesbianism. This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolved film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score — tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important." ...|$|E

40|$|In the HIV/AIDS literature, the {{tendency}} {{has been to}} avoid the agentive concept in favour of an emphasis on structure and subjectivity. Based on research with an HIV/AIDS project in Pretoria, South Africa, this article posits that examining how agency is locally conceptualized forms one route via which the notion may be plausibly inserted into {{the study of the}} pandemic. I evoke the figure of the ‘ideal agent’: the imagined <b>AIDS</b> <b>sufferer</b> against whose model actions those of actual AIDS sufferers are measured. Three stages emerge, the first characterized by victimhood, the second by moral transformation, and the third by the choice to ‘go home to one’s relatives’. In view of patients’ impending deaths, local knowledge regarding proper burial and ancestorship, and the limited resources of the project, the ideal agent suggests how AIDS sufferers’ agency is circumscribed and helps to clarify the volatility of the moral rebirth experience.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} marketing, branding, and {{fundraising}} activities of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and critically examines promotional texts used {{to communicate with}} the public. This thesis is multidisciplinary, combining scholarly work on the topics of history, humanitarianism, marketing, branding, commercialization, representation, and consumer culture. By adopting market logic and corporate strategies from the private sector, both organizations have increased revenue and created a strong identifiable brand. Each organization attempts to balance between the moral foundation or grassroots origins of the organization and the need to raise immediate revenue to sustain operations. This money-morals dilemma is also at play within the promotional material of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as each promotional text inadvertently seeks donations while also addressing the organizations’ desire to mobilize shame to <b>aid</b> <b>sufferers.</b> Humanitarian action has been dramatically redefined by both organizations to include the act of consumption and speech-acts. It is concluded that some forms of corporate-inspired marketing and fundraising efforts have changed the nature of donor involvement with the cause. Virtuous action has been made easy and thoughtless, disconnecting donors from the potential benefactors of their actions and divorcing action from duty and sacrifice (Eikenberry 2009). This notion is propagated in the promotional material of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as the technologization of action has enabled on-the-spot interventions that have simplified the spectator’s mode of engagement with the cause (Chouliaraki 2010). The promotional material of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also engage spectators in playful acts of consumerism, emphasizing the brand values of each organization (Chouliaraki 2010) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{carried out}} towards {{the development of}} a retinal prosthesis to <b>aid</b> <b>sufferers</b> of degenerative retinal diseases. Millions of people worldwide are blind as a result of diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). These progressively destroy the photoreceptive components of the eye and have no known cure. For some time a visual prosthesis has been a proposed solution, potentially restoring some semblance of vision. Recent advances in nanofabrication techniques have made a retinal prosthesis feasible. This study forms a part of ongoing research into {{the development of a}} novel prosthetic device. This study has involved the development of recording software compatible with the custom-designed low noise data acquisition system created for the purpose of testing prototype prosthesis electrode arrays. These unique flexible arrays, produced on a biocompatible polyimide substrate, incorporate 16 extremely small platinum electrodes of diameter 5 microns which are signifcantly smaller than those used by other groups. Using the intact frog retina as an animal model, {{it has been shown that}} it is possible to record responses from discrete populations of retinal ganglion cells in response to a light as a stimulus as well as electrical stimulation. The recording system has also been used to record from the optic tectum of thefrog, paving the way for future studies involving measuring the effects of retinal stimulation on the brain. Finally, in parallel with electrode array studies, a prototype complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip has been developed. This chip is the second generation of prosthesis prototype to be produced by our group. It incorporates a pixel detector, biologically-inspired processing and stimulation electronics. The development of the biologically inspired processing model is presented within this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScPhysio(Interdisciplinary Health Sciences. Physiotherapy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Objectives: This study forms {{part of a}} {{baseline}} study conducted on patients admitted to an adult surgical ICU between June and October 2003. The survival rate and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients 12 months following ICU discharge was determined. The correlation of selected demographic and ICU variables to survival and HRQoL was determined. Design: Prospective observational cohort study. Setting: Tenbed closed public tertiary adult surgical ICU. Patients: 180 subjects obtained from a previous baseline study. Measurements: The baseline study provided the demographic data and ICU variables. Survival rate was determined from a Kaplan Meier survival curve. A self-developed questionnaire was used to obtain other selected variables for comparison. A modified Short-Form 36 version 2 (SF- 36 v 2) was use to measure HRQoL perceptions of patients. Results: The survival rate was 62 % at 12 months following ICU admission. None of the selected variables were significantly correlated to the long-term survival outcome except for APACHE II which was negatively correlated to this outcome (p< 0. 01). Forty-six subjects {{took part in the}} HRQoL study. The mean HRQoL scores ranged between 43 % and 53 % for each of the SF- 36 HRQoL domains. The physical functioning (43. 5 %), role play (44. 5 %) and role emotion (43. 1 %) domains had the lowest scores. APACHE II had a significantly negative correlation to the physical functioning domain of HRQoL (p= 0. 02). Age was positively correlated to social functioning (p< 0. 01) and role emotion (p= 0. 03). Patients employed after ICU had significantly higher scores for general health (p< 0. 01) than those who were not. Patients unsure of their TB status and HIV status had significantly lower scores in general health (p= 0. 02) and role emotion (p= 0. 05) respectively. ICU length of stay was negatively correlated to role play (p= 0. 05) and role emotion (p< 0. 01). Intubation period was negatively correlated to general health (p= 0. 04). Conclusion: APACHE II was the only variable significantly correlated to both long-term survival and the physical functioning domain of HRQoL. Although the long-term survival was comparable to that of international ICU populations the HRQoL outcomes were slightly lower. Similar to international studies and a South African study evaluating the HRQoL of <b>aids</b> <b>sufferers</b> and police, the current ICU population presented more limitation in the physical functioning, role play and role emotion domains of HRQoL...|$|R

60|$|Some appreciable {{proportion}} of the British losses during {{this phase of the}} war arose from railway accidents caused by the persistent tampering with the lines. In the first ten days of October there were four such mishaps, in which two Sappers, twenty-three of the Guards (Coldstreams), and eighteen of the 66th battery were killed or wounded. On the last occasion, which occurred on October 10th near Vlakfontein, the reinforcements who came to <b>aid</b> the <b>sufferers</b> were themselves waylaid, and lost twenty, mostly of the Rifle Brigade, killed, wounded, or prisoners. Hardly a day elapsed that the line was not cut at some point. The bringing of supplies was {{complicated by the fact that}} the Boer women and children were coming more and more into refugee camps, where they had to be fed by the British, and the strange spectacle was frequently seen of Boer snipers killing or wounding the drivers and stokers of the very trains which were bringing up food upon which Boer families were dependent for their lives. Considering that these tactics were continued for over a year, and that they resulted in the death or mutilation of many hundreds of British officers and men, it is really inexplicable that the British authorities did not employ the means used by all armies under such circumstances--which is to place hostages upon the trains. A truckload of Boers behind every engine would have stopped the practice for ever. Again and again in this war the British have fought with the gloves when their opponents used their knuckles.|$|R
