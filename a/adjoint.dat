25|$|The most {{important}} property of adjoints is their continuity: every functor {{that has a}} left <b>adjoint</b> (and therefore is a right <b>adjoint)</b> is continuous (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense); every functor that has a right <b>adjoint</b> (and therefore is a left <b>adjoint)</b> is cocontinuous (i.e. commutes with colimits).|$|E
25|$|Briefly, a densely defined linear {{operator}} A on a Hilbert space is self-adjoint if it equals its <b>adjoint.</b> That is to say, A is self-adjoint if (1) {{the domain of}} A coincides with {{the domain of the}} <b>adjoint,</b> and (2) the operator A agrees with its <b>adjoint</b> on this common domain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adjoint</b> functors: A functor {{can be left}} (or right) <b>adjoint</b> {{to another}} functor that maps in the {{opposite}} direction. Such a pair of <b>adjoint</b> functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; {{this can be seen}} as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties.|$|E
40|$|We {{characterize}} ideals whose <b>adjoints</b> {{are determined}} by their Rees valuations. We generalize {{the notion of a}} regular system of parameters, and prove that for ideals generated by monomials in such elements, the integral closure and <b>adjoints</b> are generated by monomials. We prove that the <b>adjoints</b> of such ideals and of all ideals in two-dimensional regular local rings {{are determined by}} their Rees valuations. We prove special cases of subadditivity of <b>adjoints...</b>|$|R

25|$|A functor with a {{left and}} a right <b>adjoint.</b> Let G be the functor from topological spaces to sets that {{associates}} to every topological space its underlying set (forgetting the topology, that is). G has a left <b>adjoint</b> F, creating the discrete space {{on a set}} Y, and a right <b>adjoint</b> H creating the trivial topology on Y.|$|E
25|$|If a functor F: C←D is {{one half}} of an {{equivalence}} of categories then it is the left <b>adjoint</b> in an <b>adjoint</b> equivalence of categories, i.e. an adjunction whose unit and counit are isomorphisms.|$|E
25|$|However, {{universal}} constructions {{are more}} general than <b>adjoint</b> functors: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an <b>adjoint</b> pair {{if and only if}} this problem has a solution for every object of D (equivalently, every object of C).|$|E
25|$|A {{suitable}} {{variation of}} this example {{also shows that}} the kernel functors for vector spaces and for modules are right <b>adjoints.</b> Analogously, one can show that the cokernel functors for abelian groups, vector spaces and modules are left <b>adjoints.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pregroup grammars {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Joachim Lambek in 1993 as a development of his syntactic calculus, replacing the quotients by <b>adjoints.</b> Such <b>adjoints</b> had already been used earlier by Harris but without iterated <b>adjoints</b> and expansion rules.Adding such <b>adjoints</b> was interesting to handle more complex linguistic cases, where the fact that [...] is needed. It was also motivated by a more algebraic viewpoint: {{the definition of a}} pregroup is a weakening of that of a group, introducing a distinction between the left and right inverses and replacing the equality by an order. This weakening was needed because using types from a free group would not work: an adjective would get the type , hence it could be inserted at any position in the sentence.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{interesting}} examples for Galois {{connections are}} described in the article on completeness properties. Roughly speaking, {{it turns out that}} the usual functions ∨ and ∧ are lower and upper <b>adjoints</b> to the diagonal map [...] The least and greatest elements of a partial order are given by lower and upper <b>adjoints</b> to the unique function [...] Going further, even complete lattices can be characterized by the existence of suitable <b>adjoints.</b> These considerations give some impression of the ubiquity of Galois connections in order theory.|$|R
25|$|Formally, complexification is a functor VectR → VectC, {{from the}} {{category}} of real vector spaces to {{the category of}} complex vector spaces. This is the <b>adjoint</b> functor – specifically the left <b>adjoint</b> – to the forgetful functor VectC → VectR from forgetting the complex structure.|$|E
25|$|If one starts {{looking for}} these <b>adjoint</b> pairs of functors, {{they turn out}} to be very common in {{abstract}} algebra, and elsewhere as well. The example section below provides evidence of this; furthermore, universal constructions, which may be more familiar to some, give rise to numerous <b>adjoint</b> pairs of functors.|$|E

We subsequently apply {{the results of the}} theory to construct a non-singular threefold of general type X, desingularization of a hypersurface V of degree six in P^ 4, having the birational invariants q_ 1 =q_ 2 =p_g= 0, P_ 2 =P_ 3 = 5. We demonstrate that the bicanonical map φ_| 2 K_X| is birational and finally, {{as a consequence of the}} Riemann-Roch theorem and vanishing theorems, we prove that any non-singular model Y, birationally equivalent to X, has the canonical divisors K_Y that do not (simultaneously) satisfy the two properties: (K_Y^ 3) > 0 and K_Y numerically effective...|$|R
