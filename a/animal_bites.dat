40|$|Introduction: <b>Animal</b> <b>bite</b> {{because of}} {{following}} killing infections such as Rabies is {{considered as one}} of the health problem issues in Iran and other countries. Although extensive progressions have been achieved in prevention and treatment areas, spread of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> still has an increasing rate and large amount of costs have been annually spent to provide vaccine and anti-bodies. This study was done with the aim of epidemiologic evaluation of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> in Rasht county, Guilan province, Iran, 2012. Methods: In a prospective cross- sectional study, the related data of whole <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> cases were gathered in terms of demographic information (age, sex, and occupation), animal species, animal dependency (wild, domesticated, unknown), habitant, part of body bitten, season, and type of wound. Results: Totally 1014 cases (72. 5 %) of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> were reported. The mean age of studied population was 33. 63 ± 17. 81 years. The most cases of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> were related to dog (79. 2 %), domestic animals (88. 3 %), village habitants (61. 3 %), hand (55. 2 %), spring season (29. 8 %), and superficial type of wound (64. 3 %). The patients bitten from the face area were younger than those injured in other sites (p= 0. 001). The bitten individuals by other animals were younger than people bitten by cat or dog (p= 0. 002). Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} showed that the incidence of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> was higher in spring season, by domestic dogs, among men in rural area, and as superficial wounds in the 20 - 29 age group. The <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> has a relation with gender, age, and habitant. <b>Animal</b> <b>bite</b> has been yet considered {{as one of the}} public health problems and training activities could have a significant role to control such cases. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} Rabies, a {{zoonotic}} viral {{disease is a}} major public challenge in several developing countries.

The feasibility of canine rabies vaccination depends primarily upon allocation of resources through political commitment and effective public private partnerships.

40|$|Rabies is {{invariably}} a fatal disease. Appropriate wound {{treatment and}} prompt rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are {{of great importance}} to rabies prevention. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of improper wound treatment and delay of rabies PEP after an <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> in Wuhan, China. This cross-sectional study was conducted among <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> victims visiting rabies prevention clinics (RPCs). We selected respondents by a multistage sampling technique. A face-to-face interview was conducted to investigate whether the wound was treated properly and the time disparity between injury and attendance to the RPCs. Determinants of improper wound treatment and delay of rabies PEP were identified by a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis. In total, 1, 015 <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> victims (564 women and 451 men) responded to the questionnaire, and the response rate was 93. 98 %. Overall, 81. 2 % of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> victims treated their wounds improperly after suspected rabies exposure, and 35. 3 % of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> victims delayed the initiation of PEP. Males (OR = 1. 871, 95 % CI: 1. 318 - 2. 656), residents without college education (OR = 1. 698, 95 % CI: 1. 203 - 2. 396), participants liking to play with animals (OR = 1. 554, 95 % CI: 1. 089 - 2. 216), and people who knew the fatality of rabies (OR = 1. 577, 95 % CI: 1. 096 - 2. 270), were more likely to treat wounds improperly after an <b>animal</b> <b>bite.</b> Patients aged 15 - 44 years (OR = 2. 324, 95 % CI: 1. 457 - 3. 707), who were bitten or scratched by a domestic animal (OR = 1. 696, 95 % CI: 1. 103 - 2. 608) and people who knew the incubation period of rabies (OR = 1. 844, 95 % CI: 1. 279 - 2. 659) were inclined to delay the initiation of PEP. Our investigation shows that improper wound treatment and delayed PEP is common among <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> victims, although RPCs is in close proximity and PEP is affordable. The lack of knowledge and poor awareness might be the main reason for improper PEP. Educational programs and awareness raising campaigns should be a priority to prevent rabies, especially targeting males, the less educated and those aged 15 - 44 years...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Animal</b> <b>bite,</b> {{particularly}} {{dog bite}} is a prevalent {{public health problem}} {{which has not been}} taken into consideration properly. Especially, children have less experience in handling dogs and do not consider the related dangers seriously. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine incidence and related factors of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> in children less than 16 years old in Bushehr. Methods: In a prospective survey, all children (or their parents) younger than 16 years with an <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> were interviewed from March 2001 to March 2006 in Bushehr. Some information was collected from their medical records. Results: A total of 240 children (mean age 9. 14 years, minimum 90 days and maximum 15 years old) were identified. The annual incidence of <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> was 0. 19 per 1000 children between 0 - 15 years of age. <b>Animal</b> <b>bite</b> was higher in 10 - 15 years old patients and its rate was low in younger children. The most common <b>animal</b> <b>bite</b> was dog bite (79. 6 %) and in 84. 2 % of cases the animal was domestic. Most of the children (65 %) had single lesion. The affected region in under 5 years age group and ≥ 5 years age group were upper limb (41. 5 %) and lower limb (55. 3 %) respectively (P= 0. 0001). The prevalence of cat bite injury was almost two times higher in girls than boys. Also cat and monkey bites were more frequent in urban than rural areas. Inpatient treatment was required in 3 cases (1. 3 %). All patients received Rabies immunoglobulin and completed courses of vaccination (3 or 5 times according to animal being captured or escaped). No significant associations were found between the number of wounds (single or multiple), degree of wounds (superficial or deep), sex and age (< 5 or ≥ 5 years old) with the kind of animal (domestic or wild). Conclusion: Dog bite in children is frequent. Since the cost of post exposure prophylaxis is very high for national health sector, preventive strategies should focus on public education, especially for children...|$|R
