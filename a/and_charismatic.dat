5|$|The diverse {{views on}} Spirit-baptism held among Christian traditions can be {{categorized}} into three main groups. These are baptism with the Spirit as sacramental initiation (Orthodox and Catholic churches), regeneration (Reformed tradition), and empowerment for witness and vocation (Pentecostals <b>and</b> <b>charismatics).</b>|$|R
5|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the holiness movement in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> churches, however, the belief that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E

Additionally, several film critics preferred Pascal and Maximus to the film's couple.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Tory leader George A. Drew {{unexpectedly}} resigned due to ill health. In his place, the PC party {{elected the}} fiery <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> Diefenbaker.

5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|The Neo-Pentecostal {{movement}} has been characterized in part by an emphasis on prosperity theology, which gained greater acceptance within charismatic Christianity during the late 1990s.

5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome <b>and</b> <b>charismatic,</b> traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E

40|$|<b>Charismatics</b> <b>and</b> Pentecostals have a {{relatively}} brief history and tradition. In the short span of just over one hundred years for Pentecostals and fifty years or less for Charismatics, {{there are a number}} of character-istics that have emerged. <b>Charismatics</b> <b>and</b> Pente-costals have sought renewal but may, in their desire to return to their initial spiritual experiences of believing and Spirit Baptism, have missed more opportunities for reflection. Their spiritual directors have been diverse but close to the community of believers. The closeness of the community has seemed like a family as much as a spiritual movement. The implications of the Pentecostal/Charismatic spiritual pursuit, the his-tory of spiritual directors, and methods of spiritual direction are explored in this article with recommen-dations for further investigation <b>and</b> reflection. <b>Charismatics</b> focus much of their activity within the worship setting of the church. Spirituality is frequent-ly defined within the context of a church service, more than a devotional closet. Both private and pub-lic spirituality within Christendom as a whole has taken many forms. While the focus of <b>Charismatics</b> <b>and</b> Pentecostals includes the work of the Spirit with-in the heart, Pentecostals <b>and</b> <b>Charismatics</b> “love to have church. ” The work of the Spirit with its demon-stration of gifts in a worship service is often empha-sized more than the Spirit’s individualized work with-in each believer. Spirituality for Pentecostals <b>and</b> <b>Charismatics</b> cen-ters on a continual quest to recapture a person’s origi-nal reception of the Spirit. This backward look for a fresh move of the Spirit sets up a dual consciousness that at times is helpful but at other times may be a form of denial. Particularly for Pentecostals who have a multi-generational heritage, references to the Spiri...|$|R
5|$|Ruth's legendary power <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> {{personality}} {{made him}} a larger-than-life figure during the Roaring Twenties. During his career, he {{was the target of}} intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a managerial job in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with cancer, which claimed his life two years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstream}} media depicted Diệm as a friendly <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making friends with a young boy from a Collingwood public housing estate and having tea with South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, with the females wearing the traditional ao dai. In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to mingle with his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E
5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} workaholic and introvert.

Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, <b>and</b> <b>charismatic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Charisma (also {{known as}} Charisma + Christian Life) is a monthly Christian {{magazine}} based in Lake Mary, Florida, {{a suburb of}} Orlando.

50|$|Moreover, {{the classic}} {{distinction}} between Pentecostals <b>and</b> <b>Charismatics</b> {{is that the}} former are entire denominations (such as the Assembly of God) or include most nondenominational churches, whereas the latter are Spirit-filled Christians in already existing Catholic or mainline Protestant churches. Moreover, some Evangelical churches are also Pentecostal, though certainly not all. So there is some overlap.|$|R

5|$|Labor {{conducted}} an extensive campaign in marginal LCL {{seats at the}} 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the Labor Party taking power. As Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, the youthful <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> Dunstan made his older peers look lethargic as television became increasingly ubiquitous. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander {{and was able to}} convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.|$|E
5|$|With Graham {{gone and}} the quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America's most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He was handsome <b>and</b> <b>charismatic</b> in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E
