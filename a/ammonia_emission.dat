50|$|Of all the {{countries}} that ratified the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol, most are expected to meet their obligations. Progress towards reducing sulphur emissions was greater than the Protocol commitments due to a widespread European shift from coal to natural gas as an industrial fuel in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the acidification of forests and lakes was halted in large parts of Europe. Reduction of NOx emissions from traffic has less than originally expected.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{adjusting}} the initial carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ration and pH of pig manure and straw mixes on <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> and pathogen marker inactivation during composting were investigated by experimentation and modelling. Three, 210 -litre reactors were {{designed and built}} to control conditions, such as the maximum operating temperature, minimise temperature gradients and enable analysis of the off-gas for ammonia, water, oxygen and carbon dioxide.

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) is volatilized {{from animal}} manure in buildings, during manure storage, and {{following}} land application of manure.

40|$|In the ÉCLAIRE {{project a}} central {{strategy}} {{is related to}} improving the simulations of <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions.</b> Fixed emission factors and fixed temporal profiles are replaced with a dynamical approach that rely on a) weather, b) vegetation status c) farming practice d) activity status and e) feedback processes between chemistry and the vegetation. A central element in this strategy is a direct coupling between weather/climate models and the dynamical calculation of these <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> using a process based approach. This process based approach relies on an accurate description of both the weather (short term) and climate (long term). However, weather and climate models are grid based models that also include a number of parameterizations that describe the processes that cannot be fully resolved within a model. This will cause spatial and temporal uncertainty on both climate and weather in the meteorological output from the models. This uncertainty will have a cascade of effects on the calculation of <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> and must be quantified. In this study, we will quantify the spatial uncertainty on calculated <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> by using meteorological results from the WRF model. We use results from a nested setup with three different spatial resolutions (36 km, 12 km and 4 km) to simulate the dynamical calculation of <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> during spring from several different agricultural sectors. The study area covers the United Kingdom and the results show both short term effects and long term effects on weather and climate due to the grid resolution. This effect on meteorology has subsequently a cascade of effects on different parameterisations that impacts the calculations of ammonia emissions: timing as well as amount. The study shows that the spatial uncertainty is particularly pronounced near coastal or mountainous regions. The meteorological model and its spatial representativity over the study domain must therefore be considered, when <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> are dynamically calculated for air quality studies...|$|R

40|$|Ammonia is an {{important}} species in the atmosphere as it contributes to air pollution, climate change and environmental health. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> {{are known to be}} primarily from agricultural sources, however there is persistent uncertainty in the magnitudes and seasonal trends of these sources, as ammonia has not traditionally been routinely monitored. The first detection of boundary layer ammonia from space by the NASA Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer (TES) satellite has provided an exciting new means of reducing this uncertainty. In this thesis, I explore how forward and inverse modeling can be used with satellite observations to constrain <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions.</b> Model simulations are used to build and validate the TES ammonia retrieval product. TES retrievals are then used to characterize global ammonia distributions and model estimates. Correlations between ammonia and carbon monoxide, observed simultaneously by TES, provide additional insight into observed and modeled ammonia from biomass burning. Next, through inverse modeling, I show that <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> are broadly underestimated throughout the U. S., particularly in the West. Optimized model simulations capture the range and variability of in-situ observation in April and October, while estimates in July are biased high. To understand these adjustments, several aspects of the retrieval are considered, such as spatial and temporal sampling biases. These investigations lead to revisions of fundamental aspects of how <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> are modeled, such as the diurnal variability of livestock <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions.</b> While this improves comparison to hourly in situ measurements in the SE U. S., ammonia concentrations decrease throughout the globe, up to 17 ppb in India and Southeastern China. Lastly, the bi-directional air-surface exchange of ammonia is implemented {{for the first time in}} a global model and its adjoint. Ammonia bi-directional exchange generally increases <b>ammonia</b> gross <b>emissions</b> (10. 9 %) and surface concentrations (up to 3. 9 ppb) throughout the globe in July, except in India and Southeastern China. It decreases <b>ammonia</b> gross <b>emissions</b> in the Northern Hemisphere (e. g., 42. 5 % in April in China) and increases ammonia in the Southern Hemisphere in April and October. While bi-directional exchange is fundamentally a better representation of <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> from fertilizers, emissions from primary sources are still likely underestimated...|$|R

The experimental factor was the bulk milk urea level, which was adjusted to levels of 15, 35, and 55 mg of urea per 100 g of milk, respectively, by changing the level of nitrogen fertilization of the pasture, the herbage mass and grass regrowth age, and the level and type of feed supplement. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>emission</b> from the barn was measured using sulfur hexafluoride as the tracer gas. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>emission</b> generally increased upon an increase in adjusted milk urea levels.

40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} of nitrogen {{is one of}} the most important threats to nature areas in the Netherlands. At a large scale the critical loads for nitrogen are exceeded to a great extend. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> from agricultural activities contribute over 50 % to the nitrogen deposition in the Netherlands. For nature areas, this contribution can be even higher because agricultural areas are often situated close to nature areas. This offers special opportunities for (sub) national policy makers to reduce the large nitrogen loads at a local scale by relocating <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this study the <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> are relocated in such a way that nature areas are maximally protected given a national emission ceiling. This is carried out by minimising the exceedances of the critical loads for nitrogen for the nature areas and taken into account the atmospheric {{deposition of}} nitrogen from other sources and countries. This optimisation is carried out at a spatial scale of 1 x 1 km 2. For the <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> for 2010 (93 kton) an optimisation of the distribution of the emissions leads to a reduction in the accumulated exceedances of about 30 - 40 %. The percentages of the nature areas that is protected against the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen increases from 30 % to 40 - 50 %. An outlook for 2030 shows that the reductions in the accumulated exceedances are 40 - 60 % but that the percentage of protection is increased by only a few percent. The results are highly dependent on the assumptions made about the development of the agricultural practice. The effect of these relocations is used in the evaluation on whether local measures are effective compared to generic measures in reducing agricultural <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> {{contribute}} to acidification in Europe. The major emission sources are livestock and fertiliser use. This study presents {{the costs of}} con-trolling <b>ammonia</b> <b>emissions</b> in 33 regions in Europe. Abatement options include low nitrogen feed, stable adaptations, covering manure storage, cleaning stable air, and low ammonia applications of manure. Cost estimates are based on country- and technology-specific data. Variations in average costs, {{and the structure of}} livestock population and fertiliser use, cause considerable differ-ences in costs between countries for applying similar reductions or techniques. Allowing countries to choose their own mix of control options would be more cost-effective...|$|R
