5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{implementation}} of this strategy was left to the commander on site, Major General Walter Walker, {{a veteran of the}} Burma Campaign of the Second World War who had learned the hard lessons of the Malayan Emergency. Walker realised that a defensive strategy would leave all British forces tied down defending their bases, and instead determined to take the initiative from the aggressive Indonesians. Walker ordered that one-third of a unit should be left defending its base, which would be one of many along the border, while the remainder patrolled the jungle, foraying into Indonesian territory and attempting to keep them tied down at their headquarters instead. Thus, the British would attempt to control the jungle in the style of classic guerrilla warfare. But Walker was walking on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope.</b> His instructions, as were given to most colonial commanders, were to use 'minimum force' so as not to provoke Sukarno into escalating the conflict. However, he had to apply a certain level of destructive power to cow the aggressive and assertive Indonesians.|$|E

25|$|When Menken met Charles Blondin, {{notable for}} {{crossing}} Niagara Falls on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope,</b> {{the two were}} quickly attracted to each other. She suggested she would marry him if they could perform a couple's act above the falls. Blondin refused, saying {{that he would be}} “distracted by her beauty.” The two had an affair, during which they conducted a vaudeville tour across the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, 23-year-old Italian Maria Spelterini was {{the only}} woman ever to cross the Niagara Gorge on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope,</b> making four {{crossings}} over 18 days. On July 12, she crossed wearing peach baskets strapped to her feet, on July 19 blind-folded, on July 22 with her ankles and wrists manacled and finally on July 26. Tightrope crossings of the falls ended—by law—in 1896, when James Hardy crossed.|$|E

Petit walked between the towers eight times on a steel cable.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, {{the small}} Spitz dogs {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the American public when the dogs became popular entertainers in the American circus. In 1917, the Cooper Brothers’ Railroad Circus featured the dogs. A dog named Stout's Pal Pierre was famous for walking <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in the 1930s, and also contributing to their popularity, they sold puppies after the show. Due to the popularity of the circus dogs, many of today's American Eskimo Dogs can trace their lineage back to these circus dogs.|$|E
25|$|The pedestrianised {{high street}} was also redeveloped, {{with a new}} play area and new play {{equipment}} around the street, such as coloured balls, slides, <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> and trampolines. A large electronic screen has been installed, and the water play fountain was to be converted into one with water jets, with the old sculpture placed {{on top of a}} new pillar detailing the work of Geoffrey Jellicoe. Bank Court became a piazza environment for market stalls and the food court received options and improved seating. More lighting will be installed as well. This should all hopefully be completed by the end of 2015.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, the German Federal Post Office (Deutsche Bundespost) began {{operating}} a microwave radio {{station at the}} summit. In September of that year, three artistes walked a steel tightrope stretched between the East and West Summits. Two members of the Traber family traversed the same route in 1953 on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> on a motorcycle. Since 1953, an annual Gatterl Mass (Gatterlmesse) has been held on the Gatterl mountain to commemorate the {{four members of the}} Bavarian Border Police who died in an avalanche in 1952 as well as all those who have died on the Zugspitze.|$|E
25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short stirrup, in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> walker balances the acrobat. Obviously, a stirrup leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a stirrup length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the stirrup until the rider feels they will not lose the stirrup is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the stirrup is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct stirrup length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E
25|$|At midday on 3 October 1836 the {{foundation}} stone was laid by Ann Thwaytes. At 11 am gentlemen inhabitants, subscribers and visitors joined a procession at the St George's Baths and walked {{with the local}} charity school children (beneficiaries of Mrs Thwaytes) to the site to present her with a silver trowel. The ceremony was watched by invited ladies seated on a dais in a plantation decorated with flags, and enlivened by a military band. At 2 pm the charity children and their parents, totalling 500, received a free dinner provided by Mrs Thwaytes. In the afternoon there were boat races, a punt chase and <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> performance. On the Pier during the evening there was a Grand Illumination, a firework display, another tightrope performance, magic feats by Ching Lau Lauro, {{a model of the}} Clock Tower in fireworks, the Pier entrance illuminated by 30,000 variegated lamps, and a released balloon carrying Mrs Thwaytes' name in fire. An address of thanks to her was read by George Rohrs, secretary to the Clock Tower trustees who had been appointed by Mrs Thwaytes.|$|E

500|$|Travelers on the Suspension Bridge {{witnessed}} several death-defying stunts performed {{across the}} Niagara Gorge. [...] On June 30, 1859, they saw Charles Blondin's feat {{of becoming the}} first man to cross the chasm on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope.</b> [...] In mid-crossing Blondin sat down on the rope and lowered a line to retrieve a drink from the deck of the Maid of the Mist below. [...] In his later tightrope acts at the same spot, the acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion. [...] One time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid-crossing; another time he carried his manager Harry Colcord on his back. [...] While giving Colcord a piggyback ride, Blondin stopped five times on the tightrope to rest and recover his strength; each time Colcord gingerly got off Blondin's back and stood on the tightrope, climbing back on after the acrobat had enough rest. [...] Blondin's success inspired other acrobats, such as William Leonard Hunt ("The Great Farini"), Samuel Dixon, Clifford Calverly, and Signorina Maria Spelterini, to emulate and try to surpass his acts at the same spot. [...] The Signorina, the only woman to walk across the Niagara on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope,</b> once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles.|$|E

[...] And he traveled to Los Angeles to perform in a production called Essence of Rhythm with fellow tap stars including Charles [...] "Honi" [...] Coles and Jimmy Slyde.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{cyclical}} asymmetry is rapid change in an otherwise regularly cyclical model, and overreactions to counteract such changes.

500|$|Many {{of these}} images return to the savage burlesque style seen in Goya's earlier Caprichos. [...] Farándula de charlatanes (Troupe of charlatans) shows a priest with a parrot's head {{performing}} before an audience of donkeys and monkeys. In , a pope walking <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> was [...] "prudently reduced" [...] to a cardinal or bishop in the print published in 1863. Some prints showing animal scenes seem to draw from a satirical verse fable by Giovanni Battista Casti, published in Italian in 1802; the Animal Farm of its day. In plate 74, the wolf, representing a minister, quotes from the fable—"Miserable humanity, the fault is thine"—and signs with Casti's name. The print [...] "lays the blame for their rulers' barbarity on the victims' own acceptance of it".|$|E
500|$|Of Episode 6, The Mirrors Charlie Catchpole wrote [...] "Although I wouldn't want to {{bump into}} {{any of these people}} in a wine bar, I found I really cared about their {{unravelling}} relationships, their sad sexual misadventures, their petty jealousies" [...] and concluded by calling the series [...] "Exquisitely written, stylishly produced, superbly performed." [...] In The Times, Paul Hoggart summarised all six episodes as [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> between satire and sentimentality, frequently falling off on the sugary side", but wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing. He approved of the deliberately unhappy ending, looking forward to seeing how Rachel's departure would be resolved in the second series. Andy Harries attributed the mixed critical reaction to the unusual timeslot the series was given.|$|E
500|$|Dark Side of the Rainbow and Dark Side of Oz are {{two names}} {{commonly}} used in reference to rumours (circulated on the Internet since at least 1994) that The Dark Side of the Moon was written as a soundtrack for the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. [...] Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric [...] "no one told you when to run" [...] during [...] "Time", and Dorothy balancing on <b>a</b> <b>tightrope</b> fence during the line [...] "balanced on the biggest wave" [...] in [...] "Breathe".
