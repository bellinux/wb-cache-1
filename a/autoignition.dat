25|$|Both {{diethyl ether}} and carbon {{disulfide}} have exceptionally low <b>autoignition</b> temperatures which increase greatly the fire {{risk associated with}} these solvents. The <b>autoignition</b> temperature of carbon disulfide is below 100°C (212°F), so objects such as steam pipes, light bulbs, hotplates, and recently-extinguished bunsen burners are able to ignite its vapours.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal {{does not}} consist of pure carbon; rather, it {{consists}} of partially pyrolyzed cellulose, in which the wood is not completely decomposed. Carbon differs from ordinary charcoal. Whereas charcoal's <b>autoignition</b> temperature is relatively low, carbon's is much greater. Thus, a black powder composition containing pure carbon would burn similarly to a match head, at best.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to <b>autoignition,</b> which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous ammonia is {{classified}} as toxic (T) and dangerous for the environment (N). The gas is flammable (<b>autoignition</b> temperature: 651nbsp&°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50nbsp&ppm (35nbsp&mg/m3), while the IDLH concentration is estimated at 300nbsp&ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to {{the smell of the}} gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50nbsp&ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100nbsp&ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper- and zinc-containing alloys, and so brass fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.|$|E
500|$|The XB-70 was {{equipped}} with six General Electric YJ93-GE-3 turbojet engines, designed to use JP-6 jet fuel. The engine was stated {{to be in the}} [...] "30,000-pound class", but actually produced [...] with afterburner and [...] without afterburner. The Valkyrie used fuel for cooling; it was pumped through heat exchangers before reaching the engines. To reduce the likelihood of <b>autoignition,</b> nitrogen was injected into the JP-6 during refueling, and the [...] "fuel pressurization and inerting system" [...] vaporized a [...] supply of liquid nitrogen to fill the fuel tank vent space and maintain tank pressure.|$|E
500|$|Hydrogen gas forms {{explosive}} mixtures with air in concentrations from 4–74% and with chlorine at 5–95%. The explosive reactions may {{be triggered by}} spark, heat, or sunlight. The hydrogen <b>autoignition</b> temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is [...] Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, {{as illustrated by the}} faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.|$|E
500|$|In October 2005 a {{group of}} {{students}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a [...] wooden ship at a range of around 100feet (30m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show MythBusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target. Again some charring occurred, along {{with a small amount of}} flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its <b>autoignition</b> temperature, which is around 300°C (570°F).|$|E

2500|$|Natural gas {{does not}} auto-ignite at {{pressures}} and temperatures relevant to traditional gasoline and diesel engine design, thus providing {{more flexibility in}} the design of a natural gas engine.

50|$|The title {{refers to}} the {{temperature}} 451 F that Bradbury thought was the <b>autoignition</b> temperature of paper. Though this is popularly believed to be correct, scientists place the <b>autoignition</b> temperature from 440 F to 470 F depending on the study and type of paper.|$|E

50|$|Temperatures {{vary widely}} in the {{literature}} and should only be used as estimates. Factors that may cause variation include partial pressure of oxygen, altitude, humidity, and amount of time required for ignition. Generally the <b>autoignition</b> temperature for hydrocarbon/air mixtures decreases with increasing molecular mass and increasing chain length. The <b>autoignition</b> temperature is also higher for branched-chain hydrocarbons than for straight-chain hydrocarbons.|$|E
5000|$|Oxyhydrogen will combust when {{brought to}} its <b>autoignition</b> temperature.

50|$|Diesel fuel flash points vary between 52 and 96 C. Diesel is {{suitable}} {{for use in a}} compression-ignition engine. Air is compressed until it has been heated above the <b>autoignition</b> temperature of the fuel, which is then injected as a high-pressure spray, keeping the fuel-air mix within flammable limits. In a diesel-fueled engine, there is no ignition source (such as the spark plugs in a gasoline engine). Consequently, diesel fuel must have a high flash point and a low <b>autoignition</b> temperature.|$|E
