5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke {{recorded}} that they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|The next German {{aircraft}} on the scene, a Junkers 88, {{was engaged}} by a RAF Bristol Beaufighter which {{had appeared in}} the area earlier. Both machines crashed into the sea. Other German planes arrived but were driven off by Beaufighters and Hudsons from Coastal Command. The Atlantic weather conditions deteriorated. Amid concerns about the growing German threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up,</b> Commander Sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up.</b> There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville â€“ if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, {{several small}} probing attacks {{were carried out}} against the Confederate defenses, {{essentially}} ignoring orders from Grant that no general engagement be provoked. On the Union left, C. F. Smith sent two of his four brigades (under Cols. Jacob Lauman and John Cook) to test the defenses along his front. The attack suffered light casualties and made no gains, but Smith was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> a harassing fire throughout the night. On the right, McClernand also ordered an unauthorized attack. Two regiments of Col. William R. Morrison's brigade, along with one regiment, the 48th Illinois, from Col. W.H.L. Wallace's brigade, were ordered to seize a battery ("Redan Number 2") that had been plaguing their position. Isham N. Haynie, colonel of the 48th Illinois, was senior in rank to Colonel Morrison. Although rightfully in command {{of two of the}} three regiments, Morrison volunteered to turn over command once the attack was under way; however, when the attack began, Morrison was wounded, eliminating any leadership ambiguity. For unknown reasons Haynie never fully took control and the attack was repulsed. Some wounded men caught between the lines burned to death in grass fires ignited by the artillery.|$|E

25|$|For crewed rockets various {{methods are}} used to reduce the sound {{intensity}} for the passengers, and typically {{the placement of the}} astronauts far away from the rocket engines helps significantly.

25|$|The U.S. and Soviet teams {{prepared}} for the medal round in different ways. Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov rested most of his best players, preferring to let them study plays rather than actually skate. U.S. coach Herb Brooks, however, continued with his tough, confrontational style, skating hard practices and berating his players for perceived weaknesses and to build stamina. Brooks' goal was to have his team be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the Soviets through all three periods.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the Tour of Flanders {{needed a}} new identity. The {{asphalting}} {{of many of the}} traditional roads and hills made the race less demanding and more riders were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the best. Eric Leman became the local hero when he won three times in four years, thereby equalling Buysse and Magni's record. Sprint specialist Leman outsprinted Eddy Merckx as part of a select group on each of his wins, much to the discontent of fans and organisers.|$|E

25|$|Skating: A common fallacy is {{that the}} goaltender can get by with merely {{adequate}} skating, and often young players are placed in net because of their poor skating. In fact, the goaltender {{must be one of}} the best technical skaters on the team, and must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the moves of every skater on opposing teams. In particular, goaltenders must be adept at lateral skating and quick pivoting. Goaltenders must also have exceptional leg strength and the capability for very explosive movement.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania and the South Island of New Zealand {{did better}} than {{anywhere}} else in the world, with no die-off, and they were soon sending peaceful explorers to other countries. While Australia did not do quite as well, its larger land mass/resources meant that after a few decades, it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with its more fortunate neighbors, with several new political entities rising from the ashes. The most important nation in Australia was the Kingdom of Capricornia, ruling Northern Australia, with a capital in Darwin.|$|E

His best performances for 2006 included semifinals in Acapulco and the Monte Carlo Masters. He finished the year ranked at No. 34. Ranked in the top 10, Gaudio started 2006 off well at the French Open, where he lost in the fourth round in four sets to Russia's Nikolay Davydenko. Gaudio lost at second round in Wimbledon to Irakli Labadze (a qualifier) and lost his 2006 US Open third-round match to Marc Gicquel.|$|E
50|$|In 1941, when {{tanks were}} {{organized}} into {{a unit of}} their own, it was clear there was a desperate need for a troop carrier <b>able</b> <b>to</b> both <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the tanks and provide protection against artillery shrapnel and small-arms fire. Due to the war there were no international suppliers to buy from, so the only option {{was to develop a}} domestic solution.

25|$|As {{with most}} cycling races, weather {{conditions}} {{have a significant}} influence {{in the nature of}} the day's race. In bad weather conditions, the race is often a grueling contest and the peloton is thinned out in the early parts of the race. In modern times, the edition of 1985 was hit by exceptionally stormy weather and only saw 24 finishers. When weather conditions are good, the teams of race favourites can control the race more easily and more riders are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the pace. As the weather in April is highly unpredictable in Flanders, the race has repeatedly been affected by rough weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 Robert Triffin, Belgian American economist, {{noticed that}} holding dollars was more {{valuable}} than gold because constant U.S. balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth. What would later {{come to be known}} as Triffin's Dilemma was predicted when Triffin noted that if the U.S. failed to keep running deficits the system would lose its liquidity, not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the world's economic growth, and, thus, bring the system to a halt. But incurring such payment deficits also meant that, over time, the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{migration}} to West Hollywood came about after {{the dissolution of}} the Soviet Union, when thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to the city. A majority of the 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Jews settled in two major immigration waves, 1978-79 and 1988-92. Other than New York, West Hollywood's Russian-speaking community is the most concentrated single Russian-speaking region in United States.In 1984, residents in West Hollywood organized to maintain rent control. When Los Angeles County began planning to discontinue rent controls, West Hollywood was a densely populated area of renters, many of whom would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the generally rapid raises in rent in the Los Angeles area. A tight coalition of seniors, Jews, gays and renters were greatly assisted by the Coalition for Economic Survival (CES)and they swiftly voted to incorporate as the [...] "City of West Hollywood".

He visited the theatre, and {{was impressed with}} the actresses Sarah Siddons and Dorothea Jordan. Around this time it was decided that, as Chaplain to a noble family, Crabbe was in need of a college degree, and his name was entered on the boards of Trinity College, Cambridge, through the influence of Bishop Watson of Llandaff, so that Crabbe could obtain a degree without residence. This was in 1783, but almost immediately afterwards he received an LL.B. degree from the Archbishop of Canterbury. This degree allowed Crabbe to be given two small livings in Dorsetshire, Frome St Quintin and Evershot. This promotion {{does not seem to have}} interfered with Crabbe's residence at Belvoir or in London; it is likely that curates were placed in these situations.|$|E

On February 16, 2014, Miller became the oldest Olympic medalist in alpine skiing history, by winning a bronze medal in the super-G race. He shared a third place podium with Jan Hudec of Canada. By collecting his sixth Olympic medal, Miller moved to the second position on the all-time list of Olympic male medalists in alpine skiing, only behind Kjetil AndrÃ© Aamodt who won eight medals. In his last race of the Olympics, Miller finished 20th in the giant slalom, won by U.S. teammate Ligety.|$|E
25|$|To {{moderate}} the damage, {{there have been}} {{both public and private}} reforestation efforts. In 2005, forty families worked to plant 1,000 new trees in the Bosque de Tlalpan as part of an annual event sponsored by ecological associations such as Cultura Integral Forestal and Ciencia Cultura y Bosques. This annual event takes place in early July during the beginning of the rainy season and has been repeated for over twenty years. The event was initially sponsored by the Cultura Integral Forestal, made up of principally ex employees of the Loreto y PeÃ±a Pobre paper factory. Replanting efforts are focused on the main mountains of the Bosque de Tlalpan as well as the Tenantongo Valley in the same forest, planting mostly holm oak and ash trees. The annual effort has reforested over 1,500 hectares, using seeds encased in a clay ball designed to protect the seed and allow its germination. However, reforestation efforts have not been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the deforestation of much of the borough.|$|E
