Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
5|$|Gowariker {{had always}} aspired {{to make a}} romantic comedy and was {{inspired}} to adapt Rye's novel into a feature film after watching a play {{based on the same}} source material. Later, he bought the rights and co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Naushil Mehta. In the process, several plot changes were made for the cinematic adaptation, notably the similarity between the twelve girls, and the ending. Since Gowariker was against using prosthetics to create the twelve characters, Chopra worked on her body language <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to make them distinct. Principal photography was extensively done at sixty-seven locations across Mumbai, and partly in Baroda and Chicago. The soundtrack, consisting of thirteen songs, each representing an astrological sign and one compilation, was composed by Sohail Sen, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E
5|$|Persephone– The former Queen of the Underworld {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of Chains of Olympus. Bitter at being abandoned to the Underworld by her fellow gods, Persephone entered into {{an alliance with}} Morpheus and then freed and used the Titan Atlas to capture the god Helios, intending to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World. Persephone offered to reunite Kratos with his daughter Calliope in the Fields of Elysium. This she did, but Kratos reluctantly abandoned Calliope and killed Persephone to stop her from destroying the Pillar, which would have in turn destroyed the Fields of Elysium and Calliope with it. In God of War III, Persephone's remains were seen in a tree casket in Hades' palace <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Marina Gordon in Chains of Olympus.|$|E

500|$|She is {{a skilled}} {{technician}} and engineer, and renowned in the quarian Migrant Fleet, the spaceship collective {{home to the}} race. She has additional pressure to excel {{as the daughter of}} Admiral Rael'Zorah, though the Admiralty position is not technically hereditary. Her father was also strict and had high expectations, and tried to set an example {{for the rest of the}} fleet; this made him distant and saddened Tali. Thanks to her father, she also received some of the best military training available on the fleet. Tali is very loyal to the fleet, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> actress Liz Sroka describes her as willing to sacrifice her life for it. Sroka uses an accent described as [...] "unidentifiable pseudo-Eastern European, quarian Gypsy" [...] to voice the character.|$|E

It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... I never saw a girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2007, Beyoncé {{performed}} the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. While singing, Beyoncé {{was accompanied by}} her all-female band, and she incorporated Jill Scott's [...] "He Loves Me" [...] in [...] "Dangerously in Love 2". Shaheem Reid of MTV News praised the performance, writing: [...] "For all the dancing she did, Beyoncé got an equally big — if not more resounding — response for displaying her undeniable vocal ability on the ballads [...] 'Dangerously in Love'." [...] Another review from PopEater stated: [...] "Beyoncé Knowles transforms into an open book of emotion, sensuality, physics-defying dance moves and goosebump-inducing vocals. [...] she showed us that even her ballads could be over-the-top <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> had enough star power even when it wasn’t complemented by her gyrating hips." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} London production {{opened on}} October 8, 1953, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was warmly received by both audiences and critics; it ran for 946 performances. The show was restaged by Jerome Whyte. The cast featured Valerie Hobson, {{in her last}} role, as Anna; Herbert Lom as the King; and Muriel Smith as Lady Thiang. [...] Martin Benson played the Kralahome, a role he reprised in the film. Eve Lister was a replacement for Hobson, and George Pastell replaced Lom during the long run. The New York Times theatre columnist Brooks Atkinson saw the production with Lister and Pastell, and thought the cast commonplace, except for Smith, whom he praised both for her acting <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] Atkinson commented, [...] "The King and I is a beautifully written musical drama on a high plane of human thinking. [...] It can survive in a mediocre performance." ...|$|E
500|$|... ‘Chanderlier’ has {{received}} critical acclaim. Andrew Trendall from Gigwise {{wrote that the}} song [...] "springboards Sia from a behind-the-scenes genius into a superstar in her own right". Gordon from Pitchfork Media praised Sia's vocal performance on the track and commented that the track [...] "is {{enough to make you}} want to swing from a chandelier". Bradley Stern from the website MuuMuse labelled [...] "Chandelier" [...] the best pop single of 2014, complimenting Sia's songwriting credits <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> on the song. In a VH1 article, Emily Exton shared that thought, deeming it the best song Sia had ever written. Writing for Time magazine, Jamieson Cox deemed [...] "Chandelier" [...] a [...] "disarming, unforgettable listen that'll make you glad Sia kept this one for herself." [...] In a less enthusiastic review, Melinda Newman from HitFix thought that Sia [...] "can do a lot better than this".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, Beyoncé airs out her {{feelings}} to an indifferent partner, and delivers [...] "indignation and beauty in equal measure", {{as stated by}} Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune. This view was echoed by Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine, who wrote that Beyoncé endorses [...] "beauty in honesty and, ironically, power in admitting her vulnerability", and Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who noted that the [...] "raspy and husky growls" [...] that she adopts occasionally, show [...] "offering moments of raw, heartfelt emotion". Gleason wrote that the song writhes through the ache and the obsession that come from being the one left in love. Newman noted that in [...] "I Care", Beyoncé was [...] "spurred and left for dead" [...] by her lover but despite her best efforts, she still cares about him. She sings over cooing background vocals, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> moves [...] "from silken to powerful, torn to potent".|$|E

When they discovered that they both liked Sasuke Uchiha, their friendship was ended. The two eventually make amends and rekindle their friendship, but still maintain a competitive attitude towards each other. In the anime, when Sakura begins to excel in healing techniques, Ino becomes her surrogate apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends and teammates as an able medical ninja. In terms of combat abilities, Ino specializes in mind-altering techniques.

In the series epilogue, Ino ended up marrying Sai and they have a son Inojin. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Ryōka Yuzuki, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> actress in the English adaptation is Colleen O'Shaughnessey.|$|E
500|$|Music Box was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics, many of whom found the performances uninvolved and devoid of substantial songwriting. In Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden said the lyrics were [...] "made up entirely of pop and soul clichés" [...] on an album [...] "so precisely calculated to be a blockbuster that its impact is ultimately a little unnerving". Christopher John Farley from Time called it [...] "perfunctory and almost passionless" [...] in spite of highlights in [...] "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] and the title track. In Entertainment Weekly, David Browne found Carey's performance low on energy <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> no longer soaring above the backup chorus. Instead, he wrote in Entertainment Weekly, she [...] "drips over them like syrup instead of overpowering them; she lets the melodies speak for themselves." [...] Dennis Hunt was particularly critical in the Los Angeles Times, writing that Carey's pop-soul songs still lacked emotion {{even though she had}} [...] "toned down her vocal showboating". He accused Music Box of being geared toward an adult contemporary audience that [...] "likes its soul whitewashed and in small doses". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau labeled it a [...] "dud", indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".|$|E
500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Many complimented the song's piano-driven melody, {{as well as}} Carey's vocals, while some felt it was too similar to her previous single, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005). In his review of E=MC², Kevin O'Hare of The Republican wrote that Carey [...] "shines" [...] on the song, while Fox News' Roger Friedman described it as [...] "a killer ballad." [...] Peoples Chuck Arnold named it the best ballad on the album, calling it [...] "pretty". The Houston Chronicles writer Joey Guerra described the single as a [...] "gently grooving ballad that Janet Jackson should be recording instead of wasting her time on tired sex clichés", while commenting, [...] "It's doubtful, however, that Jackson could reach the notes Carey effortlessly hits {{at the end of}} the song". Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Carey's raw form of singing on the track, writing, [...] "its unadorned, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> is almost leathery in the lower notes. It's not flattering, but it rings true emotionally." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy called [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] a [...] "fairly modern Mariah track" [...] and that although he believed it was a [...] "retread" [...] of one of Carey's previous singles [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005), it is not an [...] "unpleasant retread".|$|E
