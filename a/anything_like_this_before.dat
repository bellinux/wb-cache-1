500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Indestructible" [...] was {{directed}} by Max Vitali and Nils Ljunggren. Vitali had previously worked with Robyn on the music videos for [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and [...] "Dancing on My Own". For the video, Australian artist Lucy McRae, who makes [...] "body architecture", designed a special [...] "tube dress" [...] for Robyn to wear. McRae also designed the outfits Robyn wore on the Body Talk album covers. The dress for the video {{was made up of}} plastic pipes that were periodically filled with colored fluids and wrapped around Robyn's body. Robyn recalled that the machine that kept the liquid flowing was [...] "very complicated". It was powered by drills and required [...] "a whole lot of complex machinery to function". The machine was built by McRae, who had to do it quickly because of the video's budget. McRae said, [...] "Me and the dream team had never done <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> the whole project was happening for the first time. The machine was super loud." [...] The shooting stopped four times due to leaks, and the team had to mop and re-set the technology. The shooting took twenty hours, and by 3 a.m. McRae said that Robyn was wrapped [...] "in a kilometre of tubing draped over her head and body". She praised Robyn's stamina throughout the shoot, saying that [...] "there were chaotic moments that could have been potentially disastrous and the entire time Robyn was working with us, smiling, moving when the tubes were stuck and just super happy we were making it happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cave's novel The Death of Bunny Munro, {{published}} in 2009, was released as an audiobook and Cave worked with Ellis, Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard on the soundtrack. Forsyth and Pollard {{referred to the}} soundtrack as a 3D experience and stated: [...] "We've not heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> – the result sits somewhere between a film soundtrack, a radio play and an hallucination." ...|$|E

They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse, they would marry his photographs, they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> or since." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Rasher {{was asked}} by Jameson to do a {{commercial}} commission. He has since completed many paintings for the brand. On the commission, Rasher had the following to say, [...] "I had never done <b>anything</b> else <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> and I will try anything once. It's a 200 year old brand and I am a 28 year-old man so I liked the contrast between old and new." ...|$|R
5000|$|Music {{columnist}} and blogger Bill Bentley (Bentley's Bandstand) wrote, [...] "The way that Elana James balances her rural background with big city smarts for {{a rich and}} surprising sound is the real beauty of Black Beauty. Both influences are pervasive throughout each song, but their blend turns everything into a personal glimpse of what assimilation can be. There’s even a song that features a word-for-word final letter home to his wife from US Staff Sgt. Juan Campos, who died in Iraq in 2007. There hasn’t been <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> and in putting it to music Elana James has shown the world a glimpse into eternal love. Forever." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the most}} frightened {{creature}} I saw, was a led horse that overtook us. Poor fellow, {{he had been}} born and reared in the grassy levels of the Kandersteg valley and had never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> hideous place <b>before.</b> Every few steps he would stop short, glance wildly out from the dizzy height, and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently {{as if he had been}} running a race; and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy. He was a handsome fellow, and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror, but it was pitiful to see him suffer so.|$|R
2500|$|Four {{days after}} release, it had sold about 10,000 copies, in {{addition}} to 1,000 e-book sales. Robbie Burton, executive director of Craig Potton Publishing, said: [...] "I've never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> {{in terms of the}} speed at which it's happening." [...] A week after release, sales had reached approximately 15,000, and by mid September, sales were at almost 20,000. The first two chapters are [...] on-line.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Pi {{cried when}} he learnt of Zhang Liao's death. He awarded Zhang Liao the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Gang" [...] (剛侯), which {{literally}} means [...] "resolute marquis". In 225, in commemoration of Zhang Liao and Li Dian {{for their contributions}} at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in 214–215, Cao Pi issued an imperial decree: [...] "During the Battle of Hefei, Zhang Liao and Li Dian defeated an enemy force of 100,000 with only 800 foot soldiers. There had never been <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> {{in the history of}} warfare. They can be referred to as our state's 'claws and teeth' for their success in breaking the enemy's morale. I hereby increase the number of taxable households in Zhang Liao and Li Dian's marquisates by 100 each, and award a son of each of them the title of a Secondary Marquis." ...|$|E

5000|$|Numerous reviews {{have been}} {{released}} since then. Richard Marcus, of Music Review, stated [...] "I think I'm being quite honest when I say I've not heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> disc <b>before.</b> ... It felt like listening to the soundtrack from some wonderfully anarchic musical. Something set in a basement night club in Paris during the decadent desperate period just before a war, any war. ... Theatre is Evil is far more dangerous than the music you normally hear, but it lets you know you're alive." [...] Kate Mossman, of The Guardian, wrote [...] "Theatre Is Evil feels like {{sitting on the bed}} of your tattooed, far cooler cousin 30 years ago, while she tells you 'all you need to know' about music." [...] Adam Rathe, of Spin, wrote [...] "If Theatre Is Evil does anything, it should make clear that Amanda Palmer's not just a fundraiser par excellence but someone who's energized enough people with her work to be able to create exactly the kind of record that makes people love music in the first place." ...|$|R
50|$|Revolution {{was most}} ambitious. Its {{inspiration}} was a Montréal dance group {{we had seen}} in Sydney with the odd name of La La La Human Steps, whose rapid, machine-gun, staccato movements were unlike anything we had seen before. Chris thought the technique might be adapted for the ice, if we replaced the dancers’ lifts and throws with quick-fire upper-body movements. It was long, fast and very testing, not only of our abilities as dancers, but also as actors, in particular Jayne, who had to go completely against character, with vicious movements and displays of anger. That was new, not only for her: nobody to our knowledge had done <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> on ice <b>before.</b>|$|R
500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology. Christman told Morning Edition: [...] "It feels like we've been out in this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, {{and all of a}} sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..." [...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that <b>before.</b> <b>This</b> is incredible. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it on a Web cam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't {{he really}} too absurd for anything?" [...] said Miss Mannersley, yet {{with a certain}} {{comfortable}} anticipation in her voice. [...] "You know, I never saw <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> I wouldn't have believed such a creature could have existed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, doctor; I wish it 'ad. I shouldn't 'ave thought {{anything}} of that; there's something natural {{in a man}} talking about stocks and shares and trousers, but I've never 'eard 'im say <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> He was always a wonderfully steady man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} would," [...] she answered, {{without looking at}} him. [...] "As you know, I have lived, from my standpoints, an {{extraordinarily}} unconventional life, but that was because I knew myself and was safe. But--I have never done <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> in my life." ...|$|E
40|$|A writer {{approaching}} the American Festival Project (AFP) feels {{like one of}} the blind men trying to describe the elephant in the old fable: it’s vast, and one has never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it <b>before.</b> <b>This</b> multicultural alliance of a dozen accomplished artists and performing-arts companies from all over the U. S. is a kind of movable arts feast. For 16 years they have been coming to-gether in different configurations in cities and towns from coast to coast and border to border, producing a different festival in each location. In theatre circles, the AFP is legendary for its lofty and far-reaching mis-sion. Far from a traveling road show, the AFP thinks of itself as a cultural or-ganizing tool, working with each of these communities to create an arts project that will leave lasting social change in its wake. The AFP is worth watching, if only because of the merits of each of its member companies, all of whom bear bona fide community-arts credentials and are vital arts power-houses in their home communities. The combination of these talents can add up to some awesome potential. Wherever the AFP works, it draws many artists into its net, but the “core...|$|R

"Well," [...] {{he thought}} to himself, [...] "I have played a good many curious parts in my time, but I never {{had to do with}} <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> I only hope George is not much cut up. His eyes ought to be opened now. What a woman----" [...] but we will not repeat Sir Eustace's {{comments}} upon the lady to whom he was nominally half engaged.|$|E
6000|$|Scarcely any one was {{stirring}} on the streets. The {{wind was}} pitilessly cold, though not strong. The snow under their feet cried {{out with a}} note like glass and steel. The windows of the stores were thick with frost, and Albert shivered {{with a sense of}} homelessness. He had never experienced <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> [...] "I don't want much of this," [...] he muttered, through his scarf.|$|E

I have produced Nazimova. Nazimova never threw paper-knives at cats." ...|$|E

60|$|He was a {{great man}} to those villagers, with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways. Whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread, the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about, the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage, and the {{landlord}} brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank. Then he mounted his lofty box, swung his explosive whip, and away he went again, like a storm. I had not seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> since I was a boy, and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting.|$|E

60|$|Somehow, {{it seemed}} to Farmer Brown's boy {{that he must be}} dreaming. He never, never had seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> not even in the very driest weather of the hottest part of the summer. He looked this way and looked that way. The Green Meadows looked just as usual. The Green Forest looked just as usual. The Laughing Brook--ha! What was the matter with the Laughing Brook? He couldn't hear it and that, you know, was very unusual. He dropped his rod and ran over to the Laughing Brook. There wasn't any brook. No, sir, there wasn't any brook; just pools of water with the tiniest of streams {{trickling}} between. Big stones over which he had always seen the water running in the prettiest of little white falls were bare and dry. In the little pools frightened minnows were darting about.|$|E

On hearing this Miss Boncassen {{left the room}} without {{speaking}} another word, and Dolly Longstaff found himself alone. He saw {{what he had done}} as soon as she was gone. After that he could hardly venture to persevere again--here at Custins. He weighed it over in his mind for a long time, almost coming to a resolution in favour of hard drink. He had never felt <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> He was so uncomfortable that he couldn't eat his luncheon, though in accordance with his usual habit he had breakfasted off soda-and-brandy and a morsel of devilled toast. He did not know himself in his changed character. [...] "I wonder whether she understands that I have four thousand pounds a year of my own, and shall have twelve thousand pounds more when my governor goes! She was so headstrong {{that it was impossible to}} explain anything to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the effect}} was only momentary; a few steps further she found that she could walk with little {{difficulty}} between the ranks of stalks, which were regularly spaced, and the resemblance now changed {{to that of a}} long pillared conservatory of greenish glass, that touched all objects with its pervading hue. She also found that the close air above her head was continually freshened by the interchange of currents of lower temperature from below,--as if the whole vast field had a circulation of its own,--and that the adobe beneath her feet was gratefully cool to her tread. There was no dust, as he had said; what had at first half suffocated her seemed to be some stimulating aroma of creation that filled the narrow green aisles, and now imparted a strange vigor and excitement to her as she walked along. Meantime her guide was not conversationally idle. Now, no doubt, she had never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before?</b> It was ordinary wheat, only it was grown on adobe soil--the richest in the valley. These stalks, she could see herself, were ten and twelve feet high. That was the trouble, they all ran too much to stalk, though the grain yield was [...] "suthen' pow'ful." [...] She could tell that to her friends, for he reckoned she was the only young lady that had ever walked under such a growth. Perhaps she was new to Californy? He thought so from the start. Well, this was Californy, and this was not the least of the ways it could [...] "lay over" [...] every other country on God's yearth. Many folks thought it was the gold and the climate, but she could see for herself what it could do with wheat. He wondered if her brother had ever told, her of it? No, the stranger wasn't her brother. Nor cousin, nor company? No; only the hired driver from a San Jose hotel, who was takin' her over to Major Randolph's. Yes, he knew the old major; the ranch was a pretty place, nigh unto three miles further on. Now that he knew the driver was no relation of hers he didn't mind telling her that the buggy was a [...] "rather old consarn," [...] and the driver didn't know his business. Yes, it might be fixed up so as to take her over to the major's; there was one of their own men--a young fellow--who could do anything that COULD be done with wood and iron,--a reg'lar genius!--and HE'D tackle it. It might take an hour, but she'd find it quite cool waiting in the shanty. It was a rough place, for they only camped out there during the season to look after the crop, and lived at their own homes the rest of the time. Was she going to stay long at the major's? He noticed she had not brought her trunk with her. Had she known the major's wife long? Perhaps she thought of settling in the neighborhood? ...|$|E
