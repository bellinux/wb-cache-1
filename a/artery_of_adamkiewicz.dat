40|$|Adamkiewicz artery became {{important}} in clinical practice {{since it was}} noticed that its damage during aorta aneurysm repair surgery can sometimes lead to distal spinal cord ischemia.

The study was carried on 4 Batson’s resin corrosion casts and 24 formalin-fixed fetuses injected with dyed gelatin or latex aged 15 - 24 weeks gestational age. In fixed spec-imens vertebral canals were dissected, the anterior spinal artery was traced and Adamkiewicz artery localized. Arteries were photographed and digitally measured. Data were afterwards sta-tistically analyzed. Anterior spinal artery was duplicated in 3 / 28 cases. There were from 1 to 3 Adamkiewicz arteries per specimen, mean 1. 71. No relation was found between the number <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and age. In 37 / 48 cases Adamkiewicz artery emptied into the anterior spi-nal artery on the left side. Mean degree of narrowing in anterior spinal <b>artery</b> (diameter <b>of</b> the anterior spinal artery above junction with Adamkiewicz artery divided by its diameter under that junction) was 76. 74 %. The diameter <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> was also correlated linearly with the degree of narrowing <b>of</b> anterior spinal <b>artery</b> (r= 0. 68; p< 0. 05).

50|$|In human anatomy, the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> (also arteria radicularis magna) is {{the largest}} {{anterior}} segmental medullary artery. The artery is named after Albert Wojciech Adamkiewicz (August 11, 1850 - October 31, 1921) a Polish pathologist born in Żerków.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> {{supplies}} most <b>of</b> {{the blood}} to the anterior spinal artery, which perfuses the anterior {{two thirds of the}} spinal cord. During operations for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, detailed anatomic knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and its correlation with the intercostal and/or lumbar arteries is important to prevent postoperative paraplegia. Methods: Minute dissection was performed on 102 formol-fixed adult cadavers without any history of circulatory disorders. The Adamkiewicz artery was found in the epidural space after laminectomy of the vertebrae. The entire course between the Adamkiewicz artery and the intercostal and/or lumbar artery was dissected carefully. The vertebral level, laterality, and mean diameter <b>of</b> all <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>arteries</b> were investigated. The correlation between the diameter <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and that <b>of</b> the intercostal and/or lumbar arteries was also determined. Results: The mean number <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>arteries</b> per cadaver was 1. 3 ± 0. 65, and the mean diameter was 0. 77 ± 0. 24 mm (range, 0. 50 to 1. 49 mm). Approximately 70 % <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>arteries</b> originated from the intercostal and/or lumbar arteries on the left side, frequently at the T 8 -L 1 vertebral level. There was no statistically significant correlation between the diameter <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and that <b>of</b> intercostal and/or lumbar arteries. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that, during operations on the thoracoabdominal aorta, the intercostal and/or lumbar arteries should be preserved, regardless of their diameter, to prevent postoperative paraplegia.

40|$|ObjectivePreoperative {{localization}} <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and its segmental supplier {{in advance}} of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair is proposed to be useful to prevent postoperative paraplegia. The diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) was evaluated for the preoperative localization <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> in white TAAA patients. MethodsThirty-nine consecutive patients with a TAA(A) scheduled for elective open surgical aortic repair preoperatively underwent MRA and CTA. Objective image quality was assessed by measuring the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and was related to patient thickness. Two independent observers scored the location <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> and the subjective image quality of vessel-background contrast <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery,</b> image noise, spinal cord tissue enhancement, epidural venous enhancement, and overall image quality. ResultsAverage detection rate for Adamkiewicz artery localization was 71 % (67 % to 74 %) for CTA and 97 % (94 % to 100 %) for MRA. Interobserver agreement was 82 % for CTA and 94 % for MRA. Signal-to-noise ratio was significantly higher (P <. 001) and contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly (P <. 001) lower for CTA than for MRA. Contrast <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> (P <. 001) and overall image quality (P <. 004) were judged to be significantly better for MRA. Spinal cord tissue enhancement was judged stronger at CTA (P <. 03), with significantly less epidural venous enhancement (P <. 001). No {{significant difference was found}} in image noise. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise decreased significantly (P <. 001) with increasing patient thickness for CTA but not for MRA. ConclusionsLocalization <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> in white TAAA patients is possible with both CTA and MRA. Compared with CTA, MRA is more favorable because <b>of</b> the higher <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> detection rate, the higher contrast-to-noise ratio, and its independence of patient thickness...|$|R

50|$|In human anatomy, the {{anterior}} spinal artery is the artery that supplies {{the anterior}} portion of the spinal cord. It arises from branches of the vertebral arteries and courses along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. It is reinforced by several contributory arteries, especially the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} {{portion of}} the spinal cord is supplied by the anterior spinal artery. It begins at the foramen magnum where branches of the two vertebral arteries exit, merge, and descend along the anterior spinal cord. As the anterior spinal artery proceeds inferiorly, it receives branches originating mostly from the aorta. The largest aortic branch is the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to identify {{the location of the}} artery when surgically treating an aortic aneurysm to prevent damage which would result in insufficient blood supply to the spinal cord. In bronchial artery embolization for treatment of massive hemoptysis, {{one of the most serious}} complications is inadvertent occlusion of the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz.</b> Its location can be identified with computed tomographic angiography.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{retrospective}} study of 6 patients with spinal cord infarction {{in the territory}} <b>of</b> the <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery.</b> In all patients, the clinical picture was stereotyped: sudden onset of paraplegia and bilateral radicular pain, dissociated sensory loss {{below the level of}} infarction and sphincter dysfunction.

The {{signs and symptoms of}} the patients were not essentially different from findings encountered in other types of space-occupying thoracic intra-spinal lesions. The diagnosis by high resolution computed axial tomography provides more information and may eliminate future use of myelography. In their median localisation, the thoracic disc protrusions are equally accessible by either a right or a left transthoracic approach. Yet, the right lateral approach was preferred because of the overlapping aorta on the left. If, for some reason, a left lateral approach is considered, the level <b>of</b> entry <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> <b>artery</b> should be identified by preoperative spinal angiography.

5000|$|The {{anterior}} spinal cord, {{which makes}} up 2/3 {{of the entire}} spinal cord, gets its blood supply from the anterior spinal artery. This artery in turn receives its blood from the different radiculospinal branches, which are formed from the aorta and vertebral arteries. As {{the largest of the}} radiculospinal artery branches, the <b>Artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> provides a large amount of blood to the anterior spinal artery, thereby also supplying a good amount to the anterior spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|Vascular {{myelopathy}} (vascular {{disease of}} the spinal cord) refers to an abnormality of the spinal cord in regard to its blood supply. The blood supply is complicated and supplied by two major vessel groups: the posterior spinal arteries and the anterior spinal arteries—of which the <b>Artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> is the largest. Both the posterior and anterior spinal arteries run {{the entire length of}} the spinal cord and receive anastomotic (conjoined) vessels in many places. The anterior spinal artery has a less efficient supply of blood and is therefore more susceptible to vascular disease. Whilst atherosclerosis of spinal arteries is rare, necrosis (death of tissue) in the anterior artery can be caused by disease in vessels originating from the segmental arteries such as atheroma (arterial wall swelling) or aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta).|$|E
5000|$|The major {{contribution}} to the arterial blood supply of the spinal cord below the cervical region comes from the radially arranged posterior and anterior radicular arteries, which run into the spinal cord alongside the dorsal and ventral nerve roots, but with one exception do not connect directly {{with any of the}} three longitudinal arteries. [...] These intercostal and lumbar radicular arteries arise from the aorta, provide major anastomoses and supplement the blood flow to the spinal cord. In humans the largest of the anterior radicular arteries is known as the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz,</b> or anterior radicularis magna (ARM) artery, which usually arises between L1 and L2, but can arise anywhere from T9 to L5. Impaired blood flow through these critical radicular arteries, especially during surgical procedures that involve abrupt disruption of blood flow through the aorta for example during aortic aneursym repair, can result in spinal cord infarction and paraplegia.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Solitary aneurysms of spinal arteries lacking {{associated}} vascular malformations are rare. We report {{three patients}} with spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to rupture of such aneurysms, which regressed spontaneously, as confirmed on conventional angiography. One patient had spinal SAH with presumed spontaneous dissection of a segmental artery. In the other two, SAH resulted from ruptured fusiform aneurysms of the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz</b> immediately proximal to the anterior spinal artery. Solitary aneurysms of the spinal arteries {{appear to be}} etiopathologic entities completely different from intracranial aneurysms. Spon-taneous occlusion seems to be common, justifying a wait-and-see strategy rather than urgent treatment. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of spinal origin is a rare event and accounts for less than 1 % of all cases {{reported in the literature}} (1). The most com-mon etiology of spinal SAH is bleeding from a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (SCAVM), fol-lowed by hemorrhage from intraspinal neoplasms (predominantly neurinomas and ependymomas). An-eurysms of the spinal arteries are extremely rare. In more than 3000 spinal angiograms reviewed by Djind-jian et al (1), only one isolated aneurysm was found. Garcia et al (2) reported one case of a ruptured aneurysm of the <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adamkiewicz.</b> This aneu-rysm was discovered during postmortem examination in a pregnant 34 -year-old woman. Histopathologi-cally, inflammatory and infectious features were ob-served in this case. Intraspinal aneurysms are rarely found in association with SCAVM, Klippel-Trenau-nay-Weber syndrome, coarctation of the aortic artery, or (even more infrequently) aortic arch interruption (3). We report three patients with spinal SAH result-ing from rupture of a solitary intraspinal aneurysm...|$|E
