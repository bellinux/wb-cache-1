But, unlike other Scots of the pen, I got no harm from [...] "The Shorter Catechism," [...] of which I remember little, and neither then nor now was or am able to understand a single sentence. Some precocious metaphysicians comprehended and stood aghast at justification, sanctification, adoption, and effectual calling. These, apparently, were necessary processes in the Scottish spiritual life. But we were not told what they meant, nor were we distressed by <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had not passed through them.

6000|$|Hotel Wheeler, June 22d.--We {{arrived at}} this hotel last evening from Paris, and find {{ourselves}} on {{the borders of}} the Petit Quay Notre Dame, with steamers and boats right under our windows, and all sorts of dock-business going on briskly. There are barrels, bales, and crates of goods; there are old iron cannon for posts; in short, all that belongs to the Wapping of a great seaport. [...] . The American partialities of the guests [of this hotel] are consulted by the decorations of the parlor, in which hang two lithographs and colored views of New York, from Brooklyn and from Weehawken. The fashion of the house is a sort of nondescript mixture of Frank, English, and American, and is not disagreeable to us after our weary experience of Continental life. The abundance of the food is very acceptable in comparison with the meagreness of French and Italian meals; and last evening we supped nobly on cold roast beef and ham, set generously before us, in the mass, instead of being doled out in slices few and thin. The waiter has a kindly sort of manner, and resembles the steward of a vessel rather than a landsman; and, in short, everything here has undergone a change, which might admit of very effective description. I may now as well give up all attempts at journalizing. So I shall say nothing of our journey across France from Geneva. [...] . To-night, we shall take our departure in a steamer for Southampton, whence we shall go to London; thence, in a week or two, to Liverpool; thence to Boston and Concord, there to enjoy--if enjoyment it prove--a little rest and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are at home.|$|E

5000|$|We did it as a live recording, {{which was}} unusual {{for an artist}} so new ...

So we started talking about where we could do an album that would have a live feel to it. We thought about clubs, but the well-known ones like The Troubadour were toilets in those days. Then I remembered that Barbra Streisand had made a record at the old Record Plant Studios, when they were on 3rd Street near Cahuenga Boulevard ... There was a room there that she got an entire orchestra into. Back in those days they would just roll the consoles around to where they needed them. So Herb and I said let's see if we can put tables and chairs in there and get an audience in and record a show.|$|E

5000|$|Like Black's {{previously}} directed film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys takes {{inspiration from}} Brett Halliday, namely his novel Blue Murder. Black initially wrote {{a version of}} the script along with Anthony Bagarozzi in 2001 which established the characters but otherwise was vastly different. According to Black, each would start with one detective, he with March and Bagarozzi with Healy. Along the way, they swapped characters and eventually wrote a first draft. This version of the script failed to attract any buyers, and then Black reworked it into a 64-page version that would serve for a television pilot. CBS became attracted to it, but given the contents led to many objections by the Standards and Practices department, it eventually did not progress. Black would later, upon promoting the release of the final film, speak disparagingly of the idea of the television series, stating that such a show [...] "wouldnât have been any good". By 2009, Bagarozzi suggested changing the film from a contemporary setting to the 1970s. Black's producer friend Joel Silver was initially wary of the idea as he felt audiences would not be as welcoming to a period piece, but he changed his mind after producing Sherlock Holmes. Black stated the change in time period helped as in contrast to [...] "the divisiveness that we see now", the 1970s was full of multiculturalism and [...] "was the aftermath of the protests and you got <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all in it together". The contents also drew to risquÃ© films of the decade such as Vanishing Point and Five Easy Pieces. Bagarozzi noted how the title The Nice Guys aimed to be ironic and non-descriptive, as the two main characters were [...] "literally the two worst people that we could think of and then trying to make that fun,â given [...] "one breaks arms for a living and the other cons old ladies out of money." ...|$|E

In the case of Marx and Gramsci, a series of major works published in the Brill Historical Materialism series breaks new ground as well as returning to older controversies, both resolved and unresolved. Apart from remaining arguments concerning the status of materials unpublished in their own lifetimes, the major tension that emerges here is that between the task of immanent, contextual philology and the challenge of reading âMarx for todayâ or âGramsci for todayâ.

In recent work it was shown that the denotational semantics of determinate concurrent constraint programming languages forms a fibred categorical structure called a hyperdoctrine, which is used as the basis of the categorical formulation of first order logic.

In this paper we extend these ideas to the operational semantics of such languages and thus make available similar analogies for a much broader variety of languages including indeterminate CCP languages and concurrent block-structured imperative languages...|$|R
