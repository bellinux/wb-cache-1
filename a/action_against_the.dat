Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars.

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw <b>action</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> enemy.

5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not {{consent to}} lend {{his name to}} a relator action.

In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an <b>action</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Government. This makes a relator action an uncertain, and hence an unsatisfactory, means of obtaining relief.|$|E

Some historians believe that the Mary Rose turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports, whereas others argue that it sank due to its poor design.
