However, on the Pacifics the increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed. In 1935, number 2544 Lemberg received Trofimoff piston valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages.|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for texts of its kind.|$|E

30|$|First, {{cognitive}} radio allows for more affordable service to providers and subscribers. Previously, when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> communication <b>standard</b> comes out, service providers {{have spent a}} huge amount of expenditure for building <b>a</b> <b>new</b> infrastructure such as base stations and hardware systems corresponding to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> communication <b>standard.</b> Particularly in rural areas, it is a burdensome and time-consuming process for service suppliers to include rural areas to the new service coverage due to a low user density. However, {{cognitive radio}} must have multi-standard platforms in its hardware. Due to the dynamic property of cognitive radio, service providers can reuse the existing infrastructures when serving <b>a</b> <b>new</b> communication <b>standard.</b> Thus, service providers reduce the expensive cost and time for distributing the infrastructure for the <b>new</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|R
5|$|Carte {{had been}} {{planning}} {{to build a new}} theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).|$|E

With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
