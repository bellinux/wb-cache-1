This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension of novel sequences in an <b>artificial</b> <b>language,</b> Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror self-recognition, and Numerical values.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of <b>artificial</b> <b>language,</b> object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} gestural {{training}} like <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> techniques, Amerind, and American Sign Language {{have also been}} shown to reduce language impairment in aphasics; even in those with no grammatical or syntactical ability.

Ideally this will indicate that research into the pragmatics of <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> is of theoretical interest, and will show similarities and differences between artificial and natural languages: from a pragmatic point of view <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> do not seem very different from natural languages...|$|R
25|$|Similar work {{replicates}} {{the finding}} that learners are able to learn two sets of statistical representations when an additional cue is present (two different male voices in this case). In their paradigm, the two languages were presented consecutively, rather than interleaved as in Weiss et al.’s paradigm, and participants did learn the first <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> to {{which they had been}} exposed better than the second, although participants’ performance was above chance for both languages.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} study, Saffran found that adults and older {{children}} (first and second grade children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> {{which had no}} cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present. Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.|$|E

25|$|Answering {{the needs}} of the first {{successful}} <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> community, the Volapükists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name International Volapük Academy (Kadem bevünetik volapüka) at the second Volapük congress in Munich in August 1887. The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volapük, but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volapükists and those who wanted to reform Volapük to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major world languages. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volapük Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.|$|E

For example, words meaning 'river' appear to be unmarked with respect to words meaning similar, but smaller, bodies of water (e. g., 'brook'), since some <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> derive the latter from the former, but no languages in our sample derive the latter from the former.

25|$|A {{programming}} {{language is a}} machine-readable <b>artificial</b> <b>language.</b> Programming languages {{can be used to}} create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or as a mode of human communication. The first {{programming language}}s predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written as λ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, function application and recursion. It was invented by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has now emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability, recursion theory, and as a fundamental basis and a modern paradigm to computer programming and software languages.|$|E
25|$|When the United States later {{took control}} of Japan's South in World War II, Japanese {{officials}} tactically sought to exploit Kagoshima's more northern position, its advancement in shipping technology, and most notably the Satsugū dialect's mutual unintelligibility {{as a method of}} cryptographic communication between Japan and Germany. Dozens of international phone calls had been made using the Satsugū dialect, and despite being able to eavesdrop on the conversations being sent back and forth, the United States was unable to determine the language spoken. The use of the Satsugū dialect to further obfuscate communication during both the Second World War and possibly the period of the earlier Satsuma Domain has led to a popular belief that Satsugū was created as an <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> and promoted for the purpose of being unintelligible in order to thwart enemy spies.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{indicates}} that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities {{from a single}} set of input, suggesting {{that they are able}} to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this {{indicates that}} infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a variety}} of questions regarding the form and function of relative pronouns in <b>artificial</b> <b>languages.</b> In the first {{major part of the}} paper information about relative pronouns in natural languages is presented. From this part the prospective language designer will get an idea of the range of relevant possibilities occurring in natural languages. The second major part shows some of the choices which languages designers have made with respect to relative pronouns in their languages. Generally these choices have been within a narrow range, that is, not all of the possibilities of natural languages have been selected for <b>artificial</b> <b>languages.</b> Specifically, the morphology and syntax of relative pronouns quite often resembles that of Indo-European languages, which is not surprising, since most language designers have been native speakers of an Indo-European <b>language,</b> and many <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> have been based on {{one or more of these}} languages.

25|$|The first {{administration}} of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it {{was known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of definitions, arithmetic, classification, <b>artificial</b> <b>language,</b> antonyms, number series, analogies, logical inference, and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to Yale University and Smith College. The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. The raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale, although students could score more than 800 and less than 200.|$|E
