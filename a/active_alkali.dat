50|$|Conductivity {{measurement}} is {{a versatile}} tool in process control. The measurement is simple, fast and most advanced sensors require {{only a little}} maintenance. The measured conductivity reading {{can be used to}} make various assumptions on what is happening in the process. In some cases it is possible to develop a model to calculate concentration of the liquid. Concentration of pure liquids can be calculated when the conductivity and temperature is measured. The preset curves for various acids and bases are commercially available. For example, it is possible to measure the concentration of high purity hydrofluoric acid using conductivity based concentration measurement Quhua Fluorchemical, China Valmet Concentration 3300. Benefit of conductivity and temperature based concentration measurement is the superior speed of inline measurement compared to on-line analyzer. Conductivity based concentration measurement has limitations. The concentration-conductivity dependence of most acids and bases is not linear. Conductivity based measurement can’t determine on which side of the peak the measurement is and therefore the measurement is only possible on linear section of the curve. Kraft pulp mills use conductivity based concentration measurement to control alkali additions to various stages of the cook. Conductivity measurement won’t determine the specific amount of alkali components but it is a good indication on the amount of effective alkali (NaOH + ½ Na2S as NaOH or Na2O) or <b>active</b> <b>alkali</b> (NaOH + Na2S as NaOH or Na2O) in the cooking liquor. The composition of the liquor vary in different stages of the cook. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a specific curve to each measurement point or use commercially available products. The high pressure and temperature of cooking process combined with high concentration of alkali components puts a heavy strain on conductivity sensors that are installed in process. The scaling on the electrodes need to be taken into account, otherwise conductivity measurement drifts causing increased calibration and maintenance need.|$|E

40|$|Previously, we {{described}} a novel pH-responsive RNA element in Escherichia coli that {{resides in the}} 50 un-translated region of the alx gene and controls its translation in a pH-dependent manner. Under normal growth conditions, this RNA region forms a transla-tionally inactive structure, but when transcribed under alkaline conditions, it forms an active structure producing the Alx protein. We identified two distinct transcriptional pause sites and proposed that pausing at these sites interfered {{with the formation of}} the inactive structure while facilitating folding of the <b>active</b> one. <b>Alkali</b> increases the longevity of pausing at these sites, thereby promoting folding of the trans-lationally active form of alx RNA.

Our data illustrate the mech-anistic design of alx regulation, relying on precise temporal and spatial characteristics.

40|$|As an {{important}} chemical raw material, alcohols {{can be used}} as fuels, solvents and chemical feedstocks to produce a variety of downstream products. With limited fossil fuel resources, alcohol synthesis from syngas reactions can be a potential alternative to the traditional petroleum based alcohol synthesis. Among many catalysts active for syngas to alcohol processes, alkali promoted Mo 2 C has shown promising performance. More interestingly, the alkali promoter was found to play {{an important}} role in shifting the reaction selectivity from hydrocarbons to alcohols. However, limited understanding of the mechanism of this alkali promoter effect is available due to the complexity of syngas reaction mechanism and low content of alkali added to the catalysts. In this thesis, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the alkali promoter effect with density functional theory (DFT) calculations as our primary tool. We first examine various Mo 2 C surfaces to determine a representative surface structure <b>active</b> to <b>alkali</b> adsorption. On this particular surface, we develop a syngas reaction network including relevant reaction mechanisms proposed in previous literature. With energetics derived from DFT calculations and a BEP relation, we predict the syngas reaction selectivity and find it to be in excellent agreement with experimental results. The dominant reaction mechanism and selectivity determining steps are determined from sensitivity analysis. We also propose a formation mechanism of alkali promoters on Mo 2 C catalysts that shows consistency between experimental IR and DFT computed vibrational frequencies. Finally, the effect of alkali promoters on the selectivity determining steps for syngas reactions are investigated from DFT calculations and charge analysis. We are able to rationalize the role of alkali promoters in shifting the reaction selectivity from hydrocarbons to alcohols on Mo 2 C catalysts. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Thermal-optical {{evolved gas}} {{analysis}} (TOEGA) is a conventional method for classifying carbonaceous aerosols as organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). Its main source of uncertainty arises from accounting for pyrolized OC (char), which has similar behavior to the EC originally present on the filter. Sample composition can also cause error, at least partly by complicating the charred carbon correction. In this study, lab generated metal salt particles, including alkali (NaCl, KCl, Na 2 SO 4), alkaline-earth (MgCl 2, CaCl 2) and transition metal salts (CuCl 2, FeCl 2, FeCl 3, CuCl, ZnCl 2, MnCl 2, CuSO 4, Fe 2 (SO 4) 3), were deposited on a layer of diesel particles to investigate their effect on EC and OC quantification with TOEGA. Measurements show that metals reduce the oxidation temperature of EC and enhance the charring of OC. The split point used to determine classification of EC vs. OC is more dependent on changes in EC oxidation temperature than it is on charring. The resulting EC/OC ratio is reduced by 0 – 80 % {{in the presence of}} most of the salts, although some metal salts increase reported EC/OC at low metal to carbon ratios. The results imply that EC/OC ratios of ambient aerosols quantified with TOEGA have variable low biases due to the presence of metals. In general, transition metals are more <b>active</b> than <b>alkali</b> and alkaline-earth metals; copper is the most active. Copper and iron chlorides are more active than sulfates. The melting point of metal salts is strongly correlated with the increase of OC charring, but not with the reduction of EC oxidation temperature.

Among the chemical pulping processes, kraft process is the most extensively one used {{for the production of}} cellulosic pulps starting from eucalyptus wood. The anthraquinone (AQ) usage in the pulping has as main purposes to increase the delignification rate as well as to protect the pulp from the carbohydrate degradation.

Em seguida, as polpas não-branqueadas foram submetidas a uma pré-deslignificação com oxigênio e branqueadas através da seqüência D 0 EOPD 1. As polpas branqueadas foram refinadas em moinho PFI e analisadas quanto às resistências físico-mecânicas. Os resultados obtidos indicam que a madeira do clone G- 31 apresentou menor densidade básica e teor de holocelulose, e maiores teores de extrativos totais e lignina Klason comparativamente à madeira do clone C- 41. Os clones mostraram rendimentos bruto e depurado semelhantes. O clone G- 31 produziu polpa com menor número kappa na menor carga alcalina e polpa com maior número kappa na maior carga alcalina revelando uma importante interação significativa clone x álcali ativo. Os fatores álcali ativo, clone e interação clone x álcali ativo tiveram influências nos parâmetros avaliados na polpação. Os licores residuais dos clones apresentaram valores semelhantes de pH, teor de sólidos solúveis, densidade e álcalis residuais. O clone G- 31 consumiu mais álcali ativo residual. O fator que exerceu maior influência nestes parâmetros foi a carga de álcali ativo. O branqueamento mostrou para o clone G- 31 maior eficiência na prédeslignificação com oxigênio e menor número kappa. A viscosidade intrínseca da celulose branqueada e a alvura foram mais elevadas para o clone C- 41. O aumento da carga alcalina reduziu ligeiramente a alvura do clone G- 31 e elevou a alvura do clone C- 41. Os fatores álcali ativo, clone e interação clone x álcali ativo tiveram influências nos parâmetros avaliados no branqueamento. A fibra da polpa branqueada do clone G- 31 apresentou, significativamente, maiores comprimento, espessura da parede, índice de enfeltramento, fração parede e índice de Runkel; e menores diâmetro do lume, coeficiente de flexibilidade e coarseness. O menor valor de coarseness mostrou fibras mais leves na polpa do clone G- 31. O fator clone exerceu a maior influência nas propriedades físicas e mecânicas da polpa branqueada.

Then, the unbleached pulps were submitted to an oxygen delignification and bleached with the sequence D 0 EOPD 1. The bleached pulps were refined using PFI mill and the physical-mechanical properties were analyzed. The results showed that G- 31 wood clone presented lower specific gravity and holocellulose content and higher total extractives and Klason lignin contents when compared to C- 41 wood clone. Both of them showed similar pulp yield total and screening. The G- 31 clone produced pulp with lower kappa number in the lowest alkaline charge and pulp with higher kappa number in the highest alkaline charge showing an important significant interaction between clone and <b>active</b> <b>alkali.</b> The factors <b>active</b> <b>alkali,</b> clone and clone x <b>active</b> <b>alkali</b> interaction influenced in the evaluated parameters in the pulping. The clones residual black liquor showed similar values of pH, soluble solids content, density and residual alkalis. The G- 31 clone consumed more residual <b>active</b> <b>alkali.</b> The factor that exerted the highest influence in these parameters was the <b>active</b> <b>alkali</b> charge. The bleaching showed that the G- 31 clone has higher efficiency in the oxygen delignification and lower kappa number. The bleached pulp viscosity and brightness were higher for C- 41 clone. The increase in the alkaline charge reduced slightly the G- 31 clone brightness and elevated the C- 41 clone brightness. The factors <b>active</b> <b>alkali,</b> clone and clone x <b>active</b> <b>alkali</b> interaction influenced in the bleaching parameters evaluated. The fiber of the G- 31 bleached pulp showed, significantly, higher length, wall thickness, felting index, wall ratio and Runkel index, and lower lumen diameter, flexibility coefficient and coarseness. The lowest value of coarseness showed lighter fibers in the G- 31 pulp. The factor clone exerted the highest influence in the physical and mechanical properties of the bleached pulp. The G- 31 bleached pulp showed, significantly, lowest revolutions number in the PFI mill to reach tensile index of 70 N. m/g, low Schopper Riegler degree to reach this tensile index and generated sheets with higher values to bulk and opacity. These characteristics and properties allow to conclude that G- 31 pulp was the most attractive and indicated to produce printing and writing papers.

Adjusting the luminal pH to 7. 0 caused the maximal pH to rise to 7. 88 (range 7. 59 to 8. 08), a value which is significantly higher than either luminal or reported intraepithelial pH and suggests that <b>active</b> secretion of <b>alkali</b> is involved.

In addition, the effects of CoCl 2 on the pyrolysis of raw lignite have also been investigated with a spout-entrained reactor. The results suggest that impregnating 15 % CoCl 2 to lignite can increase the yields of total volatile matters more than 2 -fold. The catalytic effect of CoCl 2 impregnated to zeolite is lower than that directly impregnated to lignite. However, catalytic pyrolysis of lignite with Co-zeolite should be feasible in an industrial setting because it is easy to separate and recycle. The catalytic effects of five metal chlorides, including CaCl 2, KCl, NiCl 2, CoCl 2, and ZnCl 2, on the pyrolysis of lignite were investigated by thermogravimetry Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) analysis. The results showed that CaCl 2 and ZnCl 2 inhibited the conversion of organic matters into light species during pyrolysis of lignite samples, while KCl, NiCl 2, and CoCl 2 promoted the conversion. The catalytic effectiveness of these metal chlorides on the conversion of organic matters in lignite samples decreased in the following order: CoCl 2 > KCl > NiCl 2 > CaCl 2 > ZnCl 2. The yields of light species from lignite pyrolysis can be decreased by CaCl 2. The effect of NiCl 2 was similar to that of CaCl 2 except it increased the yield of CO 2. When CoCl 2 or ZnCl 2 was impregnated into lignite samples, the yields of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, phenol, and carboxylate increased but the yield of aliphatic hydrocarbon decreased. The effect of KCl was opposite to that of CoCl 2 and ZnCl 2. These chlorides were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) before and after pyrolysis.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} for disposition using an electrometallurgical technique results in two high-level waste forms: a ceramic waste form (CWF) and a metal waste form (MWF). The CWF is a composite of sodalite and glass, which stabilizes the <b>active</b> fission products (<b>alkali,</b> alkaline earths, and rare earths) and transuranic (TRU) elements. Reactive metal fuel constituents, including all the TRU metals {{and the majority of}} the fission products remain in the salt as chlorides and are processed into the CWF. The solidified salt is containerized and transferred to the CWF process where it is ground in an argon atmosphere. Zeolite 4 A is dried in a mechanically-fluidized dryer to about 0. 1 wt% moisture and ground to a particle-size range of 45 µ to 250 µ. The salt and zeolite are mixed in a V-mixer and heated to 500 °C for about 18 hours. During this process, the salt occludes into the structure of the zeolite. The salt-loaded zeolite (SLZ) is cooled and then mixed with borosilicate glass frit with a comparable particle-size range. The SLZ/glass mixture is transferred to a crucible, which is placed in a furnace and heated to 925 °C. During this process, known as pressureless consolidation, the zeolite is converted to the final sodalite form and the glass thoroughly encapsulates the sodalite, producing a dense, leach-resistant final waste form. During the last several years, changes have occurred to the process, including: particle size of input materials and conversion from hot isostatic pressing to pressureless consolidation, This paper is intended to provide the current status of the CWF process focusing on the adaptation to pressureless consolidation. Discussions will include impacts of particle size on final waste form and the pressureless consolidation cycle. A model will be presented that shows the heating and cooling cycles and the effect of radioactive decay heat on the amount of fission products that can be incorporated into the CWF...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. During this {{investigation}} {{it was found}} that the 8 wt% W 03 /SiO 2 catalyst was effective for the metathetical conversion of 1 -octene or 1 -heptene to longer chain internal olefins in the detergent range. Various factors were investigated and the following conclusions were drawn: (a) Characterisation of catalysts with different metal loadings showed that crystalline W 03 is the predominant species On catalyst with higher loadings. The W 03 is well dispersed at lower loadings and is present a surface species. The activity of the catalyst increase with loading up to 6 wt% and is independent of any further increase in metal loading. This gives an indication that crystalline material does not contribute significantly to the metathesis activity. The stability of the catalysts is greater at loadings of 8 wt% and higher which suggests that crystalline material may play a stabilising role by preventing over-reduction of the <b>active</b> species. (b) <b>Alkali</b> metal ion doping can be used to significantly reduce the formation of branched metathesis products and is thus useful for curbing skeletal isomerization activity. Excessive doping (> 0. 5 %) results in loss of Bronsted acidity and hence a dramatic loss of metathesis activity. (c) The 8 wt% WO 3 /Si 02 catalyst has a long lifetime (700 h) when operating in the recycle mode using the optimised conditions used (460 °C, 16 h-I and 1 : 5. 6 feed: recycle ratio). Regeneration of the catalyst results in a longer lifetime (1200 h) suggesting a decrease in acidity or better dispersion. Coke formation seems to be the cause of deactivation. The catalyst seems to coke from inside the pores and these act as reservoirs for the deposits. (d) Carbon maps (EFTEM) of the coked catalyst showed that carbon was located around the W 03 clusters and did not cover them. This explains why the catalyst is still active even after the accumulation of excessive amounts of coke (e) Coke formation is dependent on a number of factors including temperature, time online, LHSV and amount of olefin. Trace quantities of oxygenates (100 ppm) can CONCLUSIONS 117 be used as coke retarding additives. These may act by blocking acid sites that result in reactions that lead to coke formation. (f) The catalyst is sensitive to the typical oxygenates (300 ppm in the recycle mode) present in an FT-derived feed stream however the effect of these poisons is reversible upon reintroduction of a pure feed stream. The oxygenates lower the intensity of the yellow colour of the product which is believed to be caused by polyaromatics. This effect may prove to be beneficial in terms of the quality of the final product. Master...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} {{investigations of}} hydrogen incorporation in Zintl phases and transition metal oxides. Hydrogenous Zintl phases {{can serve as}} important model systems for fundamental studies of hydrogen-metal interactions, {{while at the same}} time hydrogen-induced chemical structure and physical property changes provide exciting prospects for materials science. Hydrogen incorporation in transition metal oxides leads to oxyhydride systems in which O and H together form an anionic substructure. The H species in transition metal oxides may be highly mobile, making these materials interesting precursors toward other mixed anion systems.   Zintl phases consist of an <b>active</b> metal, M (<b>alkali,</b> alkaline earth or rare earth) and a more electronegative p-block metal or semimetal component, E (Al, Ga, Si, Ge, etc.). When Zintl phases react with hydrogen, they can either form polyanionic hydrides or interstitial hydrides, undergo full hydrogenations to complex hydrides, or oxidative decomposition to more E-rich Zintl phases. The Zintl phases investigated here comprised the CaSi 2, Eu 3 Si 4, ASi (A= K, Rb) and GdGa systems which were hydrogenated at various temperature, H 2 pressure, and dwelling time conditions. For CaSi 2, a regular phase transition from the conventional 6 R to the rare 3 R took place and no hydride formation was observed. In contrast, GdGa and Eu 3 Si 4 were very susceptible to hydrogen uptake. Already at temperatures below 100 ºC the formation of hydrides GdGaH 2 -x and Eu 3 Si 4 H 2 +x was observed. The magnetic properties of the hydrides (antiferromagnetic) differ radically from that of the Zintl phase precursor (ferromagnetic). Upon hydrogenating ASi at temperatures around 100 oC, silanides ASiH 3 formed which contain discrete complex ion units SiH 3 -. The much complicated β – α order-disorder phase transition in ASiH 3 was evaluated with neutron powder diffraction (NPD), 2 H NMR and heat capacity measurements.   A systematic study of the hydride reduction of BaTiO 3 leading to perovskite oxyhydrides BaTiO 3 -xHx was done. A broad range of reducing agents including NaH, MgH 2, CaH 2, LiAlH 4 and NaBH 4 was employed and temperature and dwelling conditions for hydride reduction examined. Samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermal gravimetric analysis and 1 H NMR. The concentration of H that can be incorporated in BaTiO 3 -xHx was found to be very low, which is in contrast with earlier reports. Instead hydride reduction leads to a high concentration of O vacancies in the reduced BaTiO 3. The highly O-deficient, disordered, phases - BaTiO 3 -xHy□(x-y) with x up to 0. 6 and y in a range 0. 05 – 0. 2 and (x-y) > y – are cubic and may represent interesting materials with respect to electron and ion transport as well as catalysis.

40|$|The {{demand for}} mixed {{alcohols}} has grown since ether compounds were banned as gasoline octane improvers in North America. Molybdenum-based catalysts in sulfide form are an attractive catalyst {{system for the}} conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols, due to their excellent resistance to sulfur poisoning and high activity for the water-gas shift reaction. The higher alcohols activity over these catalysts is low, due {{to the formation of}} hydrocarbons and CO 2. Although a number of catalysts have been developed for this purpose, not any are used commercially at this time. The main objective of this Ph. D. research is to develop a catalyst system that is capable of selectively producing higher alcohols, particularly ethyl alcohols from synthesis gas. In the present series of studies, the investigation of an alkali-promoted trimetallic Co-Rh-Mo catalyst system has led to improvements in product stream composition. The effect of different loadings of <b>active</b> metal (Mo), <b>alkali</b> (K) promoter, and metal promoters (Co and Rh) on higher alcohol synthesis from synthesis gas were investigated using commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as the catalyst support. The role of support on higher alcohols synthesis was also studied using different supports, such as ã-Al 2 O 3, activated carbons with different textural characteristics, and MWCNTs. The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method and extensively characterized in both oxide and sulfide phases using different techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that the metal particles were uniformly distributed inside and outside of the carbon nanotubes, and that metal dispersions were higher on the alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst supported on MWCNTs. The existence of promoted and un-promoted MoS 2 sites was confirmed by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies of adsorbed CO over sulfided catalysts. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) tests showed that the addition of metal promoters improved the reduction behaviour of the catalysts. XRD patterns showed that alkali-promoted catalysts were less crystalline compared to that of the catalyst not promoted with K. The formation of Co (Rh) -Mo-S species was evident in the XANES spectra of bimetallic and trimetallic alkali-promoted MoS 2 catalysts. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts were assessed in a fixed-bed micro-reactor using temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity in the ranges of 275 to 350 °C, 800 to 1400 psig (5. 52 – 9. 65 Mpa), and 2. 4 to 4. 2 m 3 (STP) /(kg of cat.) /h, respectively. The Ni-promoted catalyst showed higher activity towards the formation of hydrocarbons over that of alcohols. The total alcohols space time yield (STY) and higher alcohols selectivities are significantly higher over the activated carbon-supported catalysts compared to those supported on alumina. With increased content of K, the formation of alcohols increased and hydrocarbons formation rate was suppressed. The total alcohols STY increased with increased Co content over the Co-promoted MoS 2 -K/MWCNTs catalysts, whereas, the maximum ethyl alcohol and higher alcohols selectivities were observed on the catalyst promoted with 4. 5 wt % Co. Over the Rh-promoted MoS 2 -K/MWCNTs catalysts, the maximum total alcohol yield, ethanol selectivity, and higher alcohols selectivity were observed on the catalyst with 1. 5 wt % Rh. The MWCNT-supported alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst with 9 wt % K, 4. 5 wt % Co, 1. 5 wt % Rh, and 15 wt % Mo showed the maximum higher alcohols STY and selectivity compared to other catalysts investigated. The textural properties of the support, such as average pore diameter, pore volume and surface area, could significantly influence the extent of reduction, morphology, adsorption and has direct influence on the synthesis of mixed alcohols from synthesis gas. The optimum higher alcohols STY and selectivity were obtained over the Co-Rh-Mo-K/MWCNT catalyst at 330 °C, 1320 psi (9. 1 Mpa), 3. 8 m 3 (STP) /(kg of cat. /h) using a H 2 to CO molar ratio value of 1. 25. To predict the reaction rate for higher alcohols synthesis, the power law model was used for the reaction between CO and H 2 on the catalyst surface and the data of this study are well fitted by the model. The activation energies of ethanol and higher alcohols obtained over Co-Rh-Mo-K/MWCNTs were low compared to those values reported in the literature. The sulfided alkali-promoted trimetallic Co-Rh-Mo catalyst supported on MWCNTs was stable over a period of 720 h of continuous reaction...|$|R

The chemical composition of the Uludag fir wood was determined and this wood was utilized as raw material in pulping experiments. Two sets of pulping experiments were conducted in this study. In the first set, six conventional kraft cookings were made to determine the optimum conventional kraft cooking conditions by altering the cooking time and <b>active</b> <b>alkali</b> taking into account the kappa number and the pulping yield.

40|$|The Kraft pulping {{process is}} the {{dominant}} chemical pulping process in the world. Roughly 195 million metric tons of black liquor are produced annually as a by-product from the Kraft pulping process. Black liquor consists of spent cooking chemicals and dissolved organics from the wood and can contain up to 0. 15 wt% nitrogen on dry solids basis. The cooking chemicals from black liquor are recovered in a chemical recovery cycle. Water is evaporated {{in the first stage}} of the chemical recovery cycle, so the black liquor has a dry solids content of 65 - 85 % prior to combustion. During combustion of black liquor, a portion of the black liquor nitrogen is volatilized, finally forming N 2 or NO. The rest of the nitrogen remains in the char as char nitrogen. During char conversion, fixed carbon is burned off leaving the pulping chemicals as smelt, and the char nitrogen forms mostly smelt nitrogen (cyanate, OCN-). Smelt exits the recovery boiler and is dissolved in water. The cyanate from smelt decomposes in the presence of water, forming NH 3, which causes nitrogen emissions {{from the rest of the}} chemical recovery cycle. This thesis had two focuses: firstly, to determine how the nitrogen chemistry in the recovery boiler is affected by modification of black liquor; and secondly, to find out what causes cyanate formation during thermal conversion, and which parameters affect cyanate formation and decomposition during thermal conversion of black liquor. The fate of added biosludge nitrogen in chemical recovery was determined in Paper I. The added biosludge increased the nitrogen content of black liquor. At the pulp mill, the added biosludge did not increase the NO formation in the recovery boiler, but instead increased the amount of cyanate in green liquor. The increased cyanate caused more NH 3 formation, which increased the NCG boiler’s NO emissions. Laboratory-scale experiments showed an increase in both NO and cyanate formation after biosludge addition. Black liquor can be modified, for example by addition of a solid biomass to increase the energy density of black liquor, or by separation of lignin from black liquor by precipitation. The precipitated lignin can be utilized in the production of green chemicals or as a fuel. In Papers II and III, laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to determine the impact of black liquor modification on NO and cyanate formation. Removal of lignin from black liquor reduced the nitrogen content of the black liquor. In most cases NO and cyanate formation decreased with increasing lignin removal; the exception was NO formation from lignin lean soda liquors. The addition of biomass to black liquor resulted in a higher nitrogen content fuel mixture, due to the higher nitrogen content of biomass compared to black liquor. More NO and cyanate were formed from the fuel mixtures than from pure black liquor. The increased amount of formed cyanate led to the hypothesis that black liquor is catalytically active and converts a portion of the nitrogen in the mixed fuel to cyanate. The mechanism behind cyanate formation during thermal conversion of black liquor was not clear before this thesis. Paper IV studies the cyanate formation of alkali metal loaded fuels during gasification in a CO 2 atmosphere. The salts K 2 CO 3, Na 2 CO 3, and K 2 SO 4 all promoted char nitrogen to cyanate conversion during gasification, while KCl and CaCO 3 did not. It is now assumed that cyanate is formed when alkali metal carbonate or an <b>active</b> intermediate of <b>alkali</b> metal carbonate (e. g. -CO 2 K) reacts with the char nitrogen forming cyanate. By testing different fuels (bark, peat, and coal), each of which had a different form of organic nitrogen, it was concluded that the form of organic nitrogen in char also has an impact on cyanate formation. Cyanate can be formed during pyrolysis of black liquor, but at temperatures 900 °C or above, the formed cyanate will decompose. Cyanate formation in gasifying conditions with different levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere was also studied. Most of the char nitrogen was converted to cyanate during gasification at 800 - 900 °C in 13 - 50 % CO 2 in N 2, and only 5 % of the initial fuel nitrogen was converted to NO during char conversion. The formed smelt cyanate was stable at 800 °C 13 % CO 2, while it decomposed at 900 °C 13 % CO 2. The cyanate decomposition was faster at higher temperatures and in oxygen-containing atmospheres than in an inert atmosphere. The presence of CO 2 in oxygencontaining atmospheres slowed down the decomposition of cyanate. This work will provide new information on how modification of black liquor affects the nitrogen chemistry during thermal conversion of black liquor and what causes cyanate formation during thermal conversion of black liquor. The formation and decomposition of cyanate was studied in order to provide new data, which would be useful in modeling of nitrogen chemistry in the recovery boiler...|$|R
