6000|$|... "You {{know you}} don't mean it, John! You wouldn't take me. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> you'd hate me afterward--you'd {{want to send}} me back!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maud Barrington. [...] "Dane, Macdonald, and Hassal know, too, but {{you will}} not ask them, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> they would not tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are then! <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> prevent," [...] his hostess maturely pursued, [...] "what wouldn't have been--well, good or nice, I'm quite on {{your side}} too." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{practise}} humility, truth, abstinence or self-discipline {{then what}} is in store for you: ...|$|R
60|$|Fail. O madam, {{follow me}} quickly; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not see sport, melancholy be upon my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would you}} like me to ask <b>you</b> questions? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mean to marry the widow? <b>And,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> what'll Mrs. Carbuncle say? <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean to do; and all the rest of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not you! <b>And,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> {{you would}} dream that I was there, and wake up. There are moments, young man, {{when you bring}} me pretty near to quitting and taking to honest work.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Luka {{shook his}} head. [...] "You might drive it down {{five or six}} feet, but you would never get {{it down to the}} roof, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> you could never pull it up again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't shout so," [...] said Locker; [...] "they {{will think}} we are quarreling. Didn't I say I am not the person to tell you anything, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} me I will say it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{am going}} to fight you for disobeying my orders; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not protect {{yourself}} I shall probably kill you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> NOT--eh?--you {{have not}} stop my mouth, but your own. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>DO,</b> <b>you</b> help {{her to marry}} the Baron, your rival. You are not wise, friend Hathaway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{hear any}} one behind, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not pull the horses up soon, you will ruin them, <b>if,</b> indeed, <b>you</b> have not <b>done</b> so already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is what}} fetched you to leeward," [...] McCoy went on. [...] "Well, you can't work {{up against}} this current today. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> there is no beach. Your ship will be a total loss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} keep them, Mr. Brownlow," [...] she said. [...] "The shell is her own, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not take it}} she is so {{tenacious}} {{that she would be}} sure to smash it to atoms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I believe I am {{cutting the}} last strand that connects you with common sense,’ he replied. ‘But {{that is the}} plain English of it. You are not even to write; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> I would not answer.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [Speaking {{with great}} {{deliberation}} and emphasis.] Ah! but I am. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> what I ask you, I [...] . will pay you very handsomely! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mustn't listen. Try {{and think}} you're {{a piece of}} furniture. See? <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> happen to overhear anything, you needn't go gassing about it. Follow?' ...|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Oh yes, yes. You {{are very}} sentimental, Caesar; but <b>you</b> are clever; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> as I tell you, you will soon learn to govern.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And as to your {{dear old}} Froggy,' {{continued}} Lance, 'she says {{he told her}} he did not in the least expect you back by this train, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come by it, he'll stay in town for the 8.50.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{plans were}} in my pocket when I reached your house," [...] said Dick, who saw he must be frank. [...] "I don't know that you took them, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> I wouldn't hold you responsible; but they were taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No,--not purposely. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> it 's over now. You have {{rejected}} me. I understand that. There's {{no reason why}} you shouldn't. And I can hold my tongue." [...] He did not turn, but looked steadily past her at the boat's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said my optimist to me, one morning, [...] "that {{you must}} soon come to water, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> I {{hope it will}} be hot water." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carnival, little carnival, {{give me a}} bit of salami, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} to give me that, I hope that it soon rots. {{translation}} of a nursery rhyme ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I care for them? I love {{you more than}} all the world together. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> really love me, why should we not be happy with each other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She let her charming gay eyes rest on me. [...] "You don't look humiliated a bit, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> I {{should let}} you off, {{disappointed}} as I am; for the mysterious quality {{you speak of}} is just the quality I came to see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not turn}} shoemaker? Because {{you have not}} learned the business. Farmer, indeed! You'd never get the farm, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> you would not keep it for three years. You've been in the army too long to be fit for {{anything}} else, Walter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] said Lucy, {{who took}} nothing by her move, simply {{because there was}} nothing to take; [...] "think over it--think over it, my dear life; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> set your mind on any one--why, then--then maybe I might help you to a sight of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For a {{very good}} reason, Heer Kenzie; because I have a gun {{in my hand and}} <b>you</b> have none, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not clear the road {{presently}} it may go off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite penny-dreadful, I declare. But I don't {{think you}} will come to that; you would be afraid, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I don't much care--I am pretty reckless, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Certainly. You {{ought not}} to let your garden get out of order; <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, <b>you</b> {{run the risk of}} all {{accidents}} that may prevent your working during the three days.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} for one week, Mr. Maraton," [...] she {{suggested}} softly, [...] "that you could bring your work with you. You {{could have a}} study in a quiet corner of the house, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not care to bring a secretary, I would promise you the services of an amateur one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said he, {{with his}} usual politeness and his unwavering smile, [...] "you will greatly oblige me by not caricaturing my {{personal}} peculiarities. I am so unfortunate as not to possess a sense of humor; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> my likeness, I am afraid I should not see the joke of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Farmer Rutledge, ma'am?" [...] {{said the}} clerk, {{as soon as}} his indignation {{permitted}} him to articulate, [...] "Farmer Rutledge is in as handsome enjoyment of his health as you are--it's all a bam, ma'am--all a bamboozle and a bite, that affair of his illness; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know as much before, you know it now, ma'am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{hope there}} aren't," [...] was the {{soothing}} reply. [...] "Mines are all Joss. You either hit 'em or <b>you</b> don't. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> they don't always go off. They scrape alongside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{was going}} on that western trip," [...] said Shadow, wistfully. [...] "You'll have barrels of fun, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> locate that Landslide Mine--well, {{it will be a}} big feather in your cap." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> pay {{the money}} as demanded, {{he will be}} {{returned}} to you safe [...] and well within three hours. These terms are final, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> [...] not accede to them no further communication will be attempted.|$|R
