5|$|In 2003, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) {{released}} a report entitled Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective. By studying the international company collapses {{as a result of}} <b>accounting</b> <b>issues,</b> it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on <b>accounting</b> <b>issues</b> related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations. The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the <b>accounting</b> <b>issues</b> had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the {{handling}} of some Voyager survivors' cases was investigated by the Law Institute of Victoria, after they made complaints about the discrepancies between what they were awarded and what was received: for example, one sailor only received $72,000 from a $412,000 settlement. All of the complaints were from cases handled by David Forster of Hollows Lawyers, who handled 89 of the 214 total cases; these resulted in a total settlement of $23 million. Investigations found major <b>accounting</b> <b>issues,</b> including apparent double-charging for work done, and charging full fees after they were discounted or completely written off. In 2010, receivers were called in, {{this was followed by}} the cancellation of Forster's law practising certificate in December 2011, and proceedings against Forster in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal were due to commence on 10 February 2014; the 50th anniversary of the collision.|$|E

Scharf, John W. Stanton, and Padmasree Warrior. Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system.

500|$|Because of the <b>accounting</b> <b>issues</b> {{from the}} option backdating, Comverse Technology {{was unable to}} file full or timely {{financial}} reports with the SEC. Its stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market on 1 February 2007, and removed from the S 500 and NASDAQ-100 at the same time. The stock then traded on the Pink Sheets. [...] In 2009, the SEC settled its case with Comverse Technology; the company would {{not be subject to}} penalty fines over the backdating matter, but would accept a permanent injunction against itself regarding any future violations of law regarding publicly traded companies. [...] A settlement in a similar case against Ulticom was also reached. [...] The failure to file timely financial reports put the company at risk of having its stock registration revoked; a process deciding this, involving the SEC and an Administrative Law Judge, is still active of 2011.|$|E
500|$|On August 15, Sherron Watkins, vice {{president}} for corporate development, sent an anonymous letter to Lay warning him about the company's accounting practices. One statement in the letter said: [...] "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode {{in a wave of}} accounting scandals." [...] Watkins contacted a friend who worked for Arthur Andersen and he drafted a memorandum to give to the audit partners about the points she raised. On August 22, Watkins met individually with Lay and gave him a six-page letter further explaining Enron's <b>accounting</b> <b>issues.</b> Lay questioned her as to whether she had told anyone outside of the company and then vowed to have the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, review the issues, although she argued that using the law firm would present a conflict of interest. Lay consulted with other executives, and although they wanted to dismiss Watkins (as Texas law did not protect company whistleblowers), they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit. On October 15, Vinson & Elkins announced that Enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as Andersen had approved each issue.|$|E

40|$|Percentage {{targets for}} {{conservation}} {{have become a}} popular tool (advocated in both the scientific literature and the conservation community) for setting minimum goals {{for the amount of}} land to be set aside as protected areas.

Moreover, most percentage targets have not taken into <b>account</b> <b>issues</b> of species persistence. A recent study of herbivores in Kruger National Park took into <b>account</b> <b>issues</b> of representation and persistence in setting conservation targets and found that results were consistently about 50 % and were unaffected by different permutations of the reserve selection process. Here, we carry out a similar analysis for representation of mammals within sites that are predicted to allow for their persistence, across eight ecologically defined regions in Canada to test whether we see similar consistent patterns emerging. We found that percentage targets varied with the different permutations of the reserve selection algorithms, both within and between the study regions. Thus, we conclude that the use of percentage targets is not an appropriate conservation strategy...|$|R
