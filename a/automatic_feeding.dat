50|$|Black soldier flies do not {{fly around}} {{as much as}} houseflies. They are very easy to catch and {{relocate}} when they get inside a house, as they do not avoid being picked up, they are sanitary, and they neither bite nor sting. Their only defense seems to be hiding. When using a wet grub bin that will collect or kill all the pupae, the black soldier fly population is easy to reduce by killing the pupae/prepupae in the collection container, before they become flies. They may be killed by freezing, drying, manually feeding to domestic animals, putting the collection container in a chicken coop for <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding,</b> or feeding to wild birds with a mouse/pest-proof feeder.|$|E

The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much less expensive than copper.

5000|$|Starting in 1977, Geoff Boothroyd, {{supported}} by an NSF grant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, developed the Design for Assembly method (DFA), {{which could be}} used to estimate the time for manual assembly of a product and the cost of assembling the product on an automatic assembly machine. [...] Recognizing that {{the most important factor in}} reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria {{which could be used}} to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts. These criteria, together with tables relating assembly time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint. For automatic assembly, tables of factors could be used to estimate the cost of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> and orienting and automatic insertion of the parts on an assembly machine.|$|E

One among the technologies, which has greater developments, is the solar powered <b>automatic</b> shrimp <b>feeding</b> system. For instance, the solar power which is a renewable energy can be an alternative solution to energy crisis and basically reducing man power by using it in an automatic manner. The researchers believe an <b>automatic</b> shrimp <b>feeding</b> system may help solve problems on manual feeding operations. The project study aimed to design and develop a solar powered <b>automatic</b> shrimp <b>feeding</b> system. It specifically sought to prepare the design specifications of the project, to determine the methods of fabrication and assembly, and to test the response time of the <b>automatic</b> shrimp <b>feeding</b> system.
