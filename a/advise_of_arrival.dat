30|$|Emitter {{localization}} using direction-of-arrival (DOA) measurements [1 – 3] {{has received}} significant attention {{because of its}} importance in fields such as radar, sonar, seismology, vehicle navigation, and wireless communications. In this type of localization system, a single moving observer or multiple stationary observers are {{used to determine the}} emitter position. Generally, each base station is equipped with an antenna array {{that can be used to}} estimate the angle <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the transmitted signals. With multiple DOA estimates from different observer locations, it is possible to locate the source [4 – 6]. This emitter localization procedure is called two-step location. In the first step, the signal parameters (e.g., DOA [1 – 6], time difference <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (TDOA) [7, 8], time <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (TOA) [9, 10], frequency difference <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (FDOA) [11, 12], frequency <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (FOA) [13], received signal strength (RSS) [14], gain ratios <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (GROA) [15]) are obtained independently from the intercepted signals by spatially separated sensors. In the second step, the measurements of all sensors are transferred to a central unit and the transmitter location is estimated.
