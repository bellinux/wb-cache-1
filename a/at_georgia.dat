5|$|Greek life <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech {{includes}} over 50 active {{chapters of}} social fraternities and sororities. All {{of the groups}} are chapters of national organizations, including members of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, National Panhellenic Conference, and National Pan-Hellenic Council. The first fraternity to establish a chapter <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech was Alpha Tau Omega in 1888, before the school held its first classes. The first sorority to establish a chapter was Alpha Xi Delta in 1954. Students with Greek affiliation make up around 26 percent of the undergraduate student body.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Georgia and Duke University, Boyd began in academia {{as a professor of}} physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H. Neely Research Reactor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{official}} student government during the first few decades <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial student government and proposed an Honor Code, modeled on that of West Point's, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up a more formal organization, the Student Council (later the Student Government Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it had over the student body.|$|E
5|$|Other student {{organizations}} ANAK {{claims to}} have established include a chapter of the YMCA in 1910 and the Ramblin' Reck Club in 1930. The former claim, however, contradicts evidence of a YMCA chapter existing before 1908, and possibly as early as 1901. In 1912, ANAK additionally formed the Koseme Society, a comparable honor society geared towards sophomores and juniors <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{there was}} little student {{reaction}} <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech to the Vietnam War and United States involvement in the Cambodian Civil War.

5|$|As the ANAK Society is ostensibly {{a student}} {{organization}} <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, it {{is subject to}} the same rules and regulations as other student organizations. The society files paperwork with Georgia Tech administration and the Student Government Association, holds elections for each of its four mandatory officer positions (president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary) and is formally advised by a Georgia Tech faculty member. The president's name must be kept on file in the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement, available to any student who seeks it. As of 2007, the society's current faculty advisor is Gary S. May, the dean of the College of Engineering and an ANAK member since 1985.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the book's initial print {{publication}} date, its editor Andrew Altman worked as Professor of Philosophy <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> State University and concurrently as Director of Research at the Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics.

Jens David Ohlin was employed as an Associate Professor of Law at Cornell Law School. Ohlin's work had been published in academic journals, including the American Journal of International Law, the Columbia Law Review, and the Harvard International Law Journal. He wrote the 2008 book Defending Humanity: When Force is Justified and Why with George Fletcher, which was also published by Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Boyd was {{promoted}} to Assistant Director of Research at the Engineering Experiment Station in 1954. He served {{as director of the}} station from July 1, 1957, until 1961. While <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of research centers at institutes of technology, which argued that research should be integrated with education; Boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day-to-day research. Boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research. He was influential {{enough to be able to}} override the wishes of Joseph Howey, director of the School of Physics, on occasion: for example, Boyd successfully hired physicist Earl W. McDaniel in 1954 over Howey's determined opposition.|$|E
