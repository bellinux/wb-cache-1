These <b>attitudinal</b> barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers. Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.|$|E

25|$|Organizational {{justice is}} {{conceptualized}} as a multidimensional construct. The four proposed components are distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Research also suggests {{the importance of}} affect and emotion in the appraisal of the fairness of a situation as well as one's behavioral and <b>attitudinal</b> reactions to the situation (e.g., Barsky, Kaplan, & Beal, 2011). Much literature in the industrial/organizational psychology field has examined organizational justice {{as well as the}} associated outcomes. Perceptions of justice influence many key organizational outcomes such as motivation (Latham & Pinder, 2005) and job satisfaction (Al-Zu'bi, 2010).|$|E
25|$|Job {{satisfaction}} is often thought {{to reflect the}} extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs. It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including <b>attitudinal</b> variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} {{fundamental}} differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the <b>attitudinal</b> differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E

Miguel said the mixture of ballads and uptempo music was done to [...] "keep a steady musical line" [...] {{because he did not}} want his music to be unrecognizable. The dance tunes [...] "Suave", [...] "Dame Tu Amor", and [...] "Que Nivel de Mujer" [...] are [...] "upbeat, brass-heavy, <b>attitudinal</b> numbers" [...] while [...] "Luz Verde" [...] incorporates Latin hip hop and R [...] "Suave" [...] features a saxophone solo by American musician Kirk Whalum and [...] "Que Nivel de Mujer" [...] is a Spanish-language adaptation of [...] "Attitude Dance" [...] by American band Tower of Power. The band members assisted with the horn section in the song, which was led by one of its lead members Emilio Castillo. Miguel said he included the band's song on the album because of his fondness for R in the 1970s, citing the group as one of his musical influences.|$|E

2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{that was}} performed indicates research {{studies conducted in}} PGD underscore future research. This is due to positive <b>attitudinal</b> survey results, postpartum follow-up studies demonstrating {{no significant differences between}} those who had used PGD and those who conceived naturally, and ethnographic studies which confirmed that those with a previous history of negative experiences found PGD as a relief. Firstly, in the <b>attitudinal</b> survey, women with a history of infertility, pregnancy termination, and repeated miscarriages reported having a more positive attitude towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis. They were more accepting towards pursuing PGD. Secondly, likewise to the first <b>attitudinal</b> study, an ethnographic study conducted in 2004 found similar results. Couples with a history of multiple miscarriages, infertility, and an ill child, felt that preimplantation genetic diagnosis was a viable option. They also felt more relief; [...] "those using the technology were actually motivated to not repeat pregnancy loss". In summary, although some of these studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and limited samples, the study's results indicate an overall satisfaction of participants for the use of PGD. However, the authors of the studies do indicate that these studies emphasize the need for future research such as creating a prospective design with a valid psychological scale necessary to assess the levels of stress and mood during embryonic transfer and implantation.|$|E
2500|$|Formulaic {{language}} (previously {{known as}} automatic speech or embolalia) is a linguistic term for verbal expressions that are fixed in form, often non-literal in meaning with <b>attitudinal</b> nuances, and {{closely related to}} communicative-pragmatic context. Along with idioms, expletives and proverbs, formulaic language includes pause fillers (e.g., [...] "Like", [...] "Er" [...] or [...] "Uhm") and conversational speech formulas (e.g., [...] "You've got to be kidding," [...] "Excuse me?"

The Brisbane Transportation Study, jointly commissioned in 1964 by the MRD and the Brisbane City Council, and undertaken by American transport planners Wilbur Smith and Associates, recommended {{a series of}} freeways, expressways and bridges, although only some of these were built. Under Barton, the MRD was also reshaped. Through operational and <b>attitudinal</b> changes he introduced a [...] "private sector" [...] business mode to achieve efficiency.

Some road safety authorities have been accused of having a deliberate policy of discouraging cycling as a means of reducing bicyclist casualty statistics.

2500|$|Because of {{the high}} mineralization, several mines have opened in the belt. Sherman Mine, {{northwest}} {{of the town of}} Temagami, was a major producer of iron ore. Mining operations began in 1968, and workings consisted of seven open pits: North Pit, East Pit, South Pit, West Pit and three relatively small open pits known as the Turtle Pits. A railroad was built from the Ontario Northland Railway to Sherman Mine in the 1960s to make transportation and shipping of iron ore easier and faster across Ontario. To the north, Temagami North was constructed as a resource town in the 1960s to supply Sherman Mine. With an average overall grade of 25% iron, the mine produced approximately 10,700tons of crude ore per day and its mill capacity was [...] of iron ore pellets per year. Operations at Sherman Mine ceased in 1990 after its owner Dofasco announced that they would be closing the mine. The municipality of Temagami made several approaches to Dofasco before the closer of Sherman Mine, offering a partnership in the community's future in terms of shared funding for a Sherman Park. However, it was informed during discussions with Dofasco's media executives that in the future they could not be counted on for maintenance funds for parks or anything else that was being done in partnership with the community. This caused a large <b>attitudinal</b> change from a few months earlier when the mine was associated with much of Temagami. The closure also {{had a significant impact on}} the economy of Temagami. There is still iron ore at Sherman Mine, but Dofasco were able to obtain it more cheaply elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|A {{critical}} factor of building brand loyalty {{is developing a}} connection or relationship between the consumer and the brand. When an emotional relationship is created between the consumer and the brand {{this leads to a}} strong bond and a competitive advantage for that particular brand.Loyalty consists of both <b>attitudinal</b> and behavioural components. <b>Attitudinal</b> loyalty relates to the customers willingness to purchase product or service from the brand at any reasonable cost. Behavioural loyalty is the re-purchasing.Both behavioral and <b>attitudinal</b> components are important. One example is that a consumer displays behavioural loyalty by buying Coke when there are few alternatives available and <b>attitudinal</b> loyalty when they will not buy an alternative brand when Coke is not available.The <b>attitudinal</b> component is psychological, this leads to the behavioural action of repeat purchase. It is the <b>attitudinal</b> loyalty that drives most loyalty behaviour and ensures loyalty over time not just with one purchase. “Brand loyalty is desired by firms because retention of existing customers is less costly than obtaining new ones. Firms profit from having loyal customers” (Melnyk & Bijmolt, 2015).|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} motivation approach of Viktor Frankl emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and <b>attitudinal.</b> Creative values {{are expressed in}} acts of creating or producing something.
