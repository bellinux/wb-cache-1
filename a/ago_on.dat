5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The {{results showed that the}} tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> the caldera's flanks despite their location {{are not part}} of the La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes that accompanied the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years <b>ago,</b> <b>on</b> July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The Kirtlandian faunal age {{was named}} by Lucas and Sullivan in 2003, and found by their {{original}} study to date from 74.9 to 72million years ago. In 2006, Sullivan and Lucas refined their estimate, {{stating that the}} Kirtlandian ranged from 75 to 72.8million years ago. Later that year, Sullivan changed the time range again, finding that the faunal age lasted only 2 million years, from 74.8 to 72.8million years ago. He said that the later part of the Kirtlandian, from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, dated to 73 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>on</b> the basis of ash layers dating to 73.04 and 73.37million years ago. This observation was based on findings by Sullivan and Lucas, who dated the two ash layers from 73.04 ± 0.25 and 73.37 ± 0.28million years ago. They also dated the earlier ashes from the Fruitland Formation, which dated to 75.56 ± 0.41, 74.55 ± 0.29, and 74.11 ± 0.62 million years ago. The first ash, called by them the Dog Eye Pond, was found slightly higher than {{the start of the}} Fruitland Formation, which meant that the start of the Fruitland Formation was older than 75.5 million years ago. More precise dating in 2010 by Longrich found that the second youngest ash can actually be dated more precisely than thought by Sullivan (2006), only having an error range of 0.18million years. Longrich also dated the two older ashes, finding a date {{the same as that of}} Sullivan in 2006. These ash datings are what Sullivan used to find the precise age of the Kirtlandian age.|$|E

Based on the similarities in their flora, botanist Ronald Good identified a separate Antarctic Floristic Kingdom that included southern South America, New Zealand, and some southern island groups. Good identified Australia as its own floristic kingdom, and included New Guinea and New Caledonia in the Paleotropical floristic kingdom, because of the influx of tropical Eurasian flora that had mostly supplanted the Antarctic flora.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary mission}} of the Viking probes of the mid-1970s was to carry out {{experiments}} designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil because the favorable conditions {{for the evolution of}} multicellular organisms ceased some four billion years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> Mars.

Of the four experiments, only the Labeled Release (LR) experiment returned a positive result, showing increased 14CO2 production on first exposure of soil to water and nutrients. All scientists agree on two points from the Viking missions: that radiolabeled 14CO2 was evolved in the Labeled Release experiment, and that the GCMS detected no organic molecules. However, there are vastly different interpretations of what those results imply.|$|E

25|$|The {{hand loom}} with the witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of dobby, with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can work up to 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for woven fabrics made today were developed and created long <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> similar narrow-width pattern looms.|$|E
25|$|The {{claim that}} the National Guard is older than the nation itself, with over {{three and a half}} centuries of service, is based on the {{claim that the}} modern-day 101st Field Artillery Regiment, 182nd Infantry Regiment, 101st Engineer Battalion and 181st Infantry Regiment of the Massachusetts Army National Guard are {{directly}} descended from Massachusetts Bay Colony regiments formed over 375 years <b>ago.</b> <b>On</b> December 13, 1636, the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony had ordered that the Colony's scattered militia companies be organized into North, South and East Regiments—with a goal of increasing the militias' accountability to the colonial government, efficacy, and responsiveness in conflicts with indigenous Pequot Indians. Under this act, white males between the ages of 16 and 60 were obligated to possess arms and {{to take part in the}} defense of their communities by serving in nightly guard details and participating in weekly drills. The founding date of 1636 refers to service of the colonial government; the Massachusetts Bay Colony regiments were formed by reorganizing local militias that preceded the 1636 date and dated back to the founding dates of the various Massachusetts towns of the time.|$|E
