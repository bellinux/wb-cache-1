The report presents data on the demographic composition and academic preparation of applicants, first-time enrollees, and total first-year enrollees during these two <b>application</b> <b>cycles.</b> The data indicate that the number of appli-cants has decreased modestly during this time, yet the number of first-time, first-year enrollees continues to rise mainly reflecting the opening of new dental schools and expansion of existing class sizes at some schools. Findings also indicate reduced gaps by gender in dental school applicants and enrollees. By contrast, the percentage of underrepresented minority applicants and en-rollees increased only slightly. The results highlighted in this study have important implications for health professions education advisors, dental educators, and members of the broader dental education community...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Studies {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} technological innovations on how an industry develops focus on the different effects produced by radical innovations versus incremental innovations. The studies either examine the technology cycles or the market development cycles in isolation without really explaining {{the interaction between the}} two. In this paper, we present a model of industry development that takes into account the dynamics of innovation in the industry accentuated by the interplay between technology development <b>cycles</b> and <b>application</b> development <b>cycles.</b> The model proposes that these two cycles go through a linked, predictable double helix pattern. The personal computer (PC) industry is used as an example of this model’s operation, as the PC industry has gone through three distinct technology cycles (8 -b, 16 -b, and 32 -b processors) and corresponding three distinct <b>application</b> <b>cycles.</b> We draw some important conclusions about how companies can use this understanding to develop better technology and market strategies to succeed in the various stages of the industry’s development...|$|R

The novelty of our contribution comes from (1) the adaptation of the well-known exponentially weighted moving average technique to wireless mesh network scenarios and (2) using this mechanism to control the behavior of sensor nodes so that they become synchronized in relevant time instants which are defined by their <b>application</b> duty <b>cycles.</b>|$|R
