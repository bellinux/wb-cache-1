40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} a three-year collaborative research project between the British Geological Survey (BGS), The Natural History Museum, London (NHM) and the Geological Survey Department, Cyprus (GSD). It was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Cyprus. The objectives of the programme were to develop new methodologies for the exploration and exploitation of cupriferous sulphide ore and re-establish metalliferous mineral exploration research on Cyprus and within the GSD. Initially the project only involved the BGS, the NHM and the GSD. However, early on, it became apparent that mining and mineral exploration companies held key datasets, needed to develop the new methodologies. Therefore, negotiations were conducted with the Hellenic Mining Company, Eastern Mediterranean Minerals and Hellenic Copper Mines. These established a framework for collaboration and all parties signed a confidentiality agreement. This allowed the BGS–NHM–GSD team to use proprietary data in their combined metallogenic–prospectivity analysis and the companies to have exclusive access to project results for six months after project completion. The project comprised five distinct components: •	Technology transfer and institutional strengthening. •	Development of new metallogenic models for ophiolite–hosted mineralization, including an examination of gold-rich epithermal-style mineralization associated with submarine basalts. •	Mineralogical and metallurgical analysis of low-grade copper mineralization, with a review of solvent extraction electro-winning (SX-EW) technologies. •	The use of legacy and new data at the regional to district scales for GIS-based prospectivity modelling. This included a reinterpretation of geophysical data. •	A pilot study, using the prospectivity analysis, to define and test the mineralization potential of prospectivity anomalies. To facilitate technology transfer and institutional strengthening the project delivered a number of office and field-based seminars and workshops. These included training in the use of GIS for prospectivity analysis, examination of potential epithermal style mineralization, lectures on: (i) epithermal mineralization in the Aegean, (ii) VHMS mineralization in the Urals and (iii) SX-EW hydrometallurgical techniques—these were given to the Cyprus Society of Geologists and Engineers to ensure the widest dissemination. In addition, to give the project an international dimension, the prospectivity analyses were presented at two international conferences in Thessaloniki and Beijing. The project produced, using ArcSDM and a variety of geological, geophysical and remote sensing datasets, two prospectivity investigations: (i) a regional prospectivity map covering all of the Troodos Massif. This identified eight separate areas of high mineralization potential. The areas are generally located within 10 km of the boundary between the Troodos ophiolite and the autochthonous sedimentary cover sequences draping the ophiolite. (ii) A more detailed map focussed on an area of the northern Troodos. This identified drilling targets in the Memi–Alestos area. Key components to the prospectivity analysis undertaken by the project team included: (i) The digitisation of mineral occurrences and gossan distribution. (ii) The analysis of remote sensing data using band ratio image processing techniques to highlight regional alteration trends. (iii) The modelling and interpretation of <b>airborne</b> magnetic <b>geophysics</b> comprised the amalgamation of three generations of data into a single data set and the identification of lineaments and regions with positive and negative magnetic anomalies. In addition to the development of an ophiolite-hosted prospectivity GIS for the Troodos, the project addressed two new metallogenetic concepts for Cyprus—namely (i) The investigation of potential epithermal style VHMS mineralization using infrared spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction techniques. This study identified high temperature advanced argillic alteration phases and concluded that sub-seafloor boiling was responsible for some of the gold enrichment recorded in Cyprus-type VHMS mineralization (ii) The development of low-grade supergene Cu mineralization associated with massive sulphide mineralization. This showed that the favourable interplay between the mineralization and topography {{played an important role in}} the development of the large secondary low-grade orebodies. A strategy for exploring for such a supergene copper target would be to assess all surface gossans developed in topographic highs and seek potential downslope areas of mineralization—the use of high resolution digital elevation models provided by techniques such as LiDAR could be a way forward in this respect Professor John Monhemius, Imperial College London, undertook a review of the use of SX-EW hydrometallurgical techniques as applied to Cyprus. This study concluded that the decline in copper recoveries in the heap leach process used at Skouriotissa is due to increasing amounts of primary chalcopyrite, a refractory mineral that is very resistant to dissolution by oxidation, in the run-of-mine ore as mining gets deeper. Recent processes developed for the hydrometallurgical treatment of chalcopyrite all involve the use of extreme conditions, such as high temperature pressure leaching, ultra-fine grinding, or intensified bacterial leaching—these may not be appropriate for Skouriotissa and the best option for extending the life of the plant may be the discovery and exploitation of further reserves of supergene altered copper ores containing leachable copper oxide and secondary sulphide minerals This will allow production to continue using the heap leaching technology currently in use. If necessary, the effectiveness of this leaching method towards secondary copper sulphide minerals could be improved by introducing tanks for bacterially pre-oxidising the leach solutions under optimum conditions, prior to being sprayed on to the ore heaps. One key component of the project was to formulate and implement a pilot project based on the results of the regional GIS. The goal of the pilot project was to site a borehole to test if prospectivity analysis had the capability to predict the location of unknown mineralization. The application of a detailed prospectivity GIS using public domain and proprietary geophysical data focussed on the northern Troodos identified a high prospectivity zone in the Memi–Alestos region. Two boreholes were sited to test for the presence of mineralization beneath Upper Pillow Lava cover and one of these encountered over 20 m of argillically and propylitically altered lavas containing minor amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite. This shows that prospectivity analysis approach used in this project could be a useful tool for locating buried VHMS mineralization on Cyprus. This is especially so when high-resolution geophysical data are available. In terms of future work, the project identified development in the following areas: •	The need for national high-resolution geochemical and geophysical datasets to provide pre-competitive information for mineral exploration and environmental assessment •	The development of fuzzy logic techniques for prospectivity mapping •	Processing and interpretation of high-resolution airborne remote sensing data...|$|R

The work involved compiling a mosaic of airborne gamma-radiometrics across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) and analysing this together with existing <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysics</b> and drilling data. A significant correlation was found between aeolian (wind-blown) materials, upland salts and the geophysical signatures of both airborne gamma-radiometrics and airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data. This is consistent with the conceptual model that much of the salt in the upland areas of the MDB is sourced from deposited aeolian materials that are derived from salt-bearing landscapes in the western arid part of the basin. Analysis of borehole data provided a characteristic gamma-radiometric signature for aeolian salt-sources. This signature was used to derive a continuous classification of upland salt-source from the airborne data mosaic. The major area of modelled aeolian salt-source materials forms a fragmented arcuate body stretching from northern Victoria to north-central NSW that is consistent with aeolian deposition from a dominant westerly dust path. The combined modelling and analysis of AEM and gamma-ray data provides a better understanding of salinity in relation to geological materials in the landscape.

These datasets were used to create a final prospectivity map using the fuzzy logic technique. The gold mineralization of Cascavel target is inserted in an orogenic system and occurs in two overlapping quartz veins systems, called Mestre-Cascavel and Cuca, embedded in quartzite with an average thickness 50 cm and guidance N 45 º- 60 ºW/ 25 ºSW with free coarse gold in grains 2 - 3 mm to 3 cm. The prospectivity map created for this prospect generated four first-order favorable areas for mineralization and new medium-favorability foci. The Tinteiro area, derived from studies conducted by Orinoco do Brasil Mineração Ltda., shows polymetallic mineralization associated with an iron oxide-copper-gold ore deposit (IOCG) system posterior to Cascavel target mineralization. Its prospectivity map generated 19 new target sites with the potential for Au, Cu and Ag mineralization, suggesting new directions for future prospecting programs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{variety of}} {{regional}} geoscience datasets from Nova Scotia have been co-registered and analyzed using a {{geographic information system}} (GIS). The datasets include bedrock and surficial geological maps, airborne geophysical survey data, geochemistry of lake-sediment samples, and mineral occurrence data. A number of line features, including structural lineaments, fold axes and formation contacts, have also been digitized. The GIS uses a quadtree structure, ideally suited to a mixture of polygonal-thematic (e. g., geological maps) and continuous "grey-scale " (e. g., remote sensing, <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysics)</b> raster images. The goal {{of the study was}} to create a map showing areas favorable for gold mineralization, based on the distribution of 70 known gold occurrences. Initially, a multi-element geochemical signature was generated using a regression analysis to find the linear combination of geochemical elements that best predict lake catchment bas ins containing a gold occurrence. A predicted gold occurrence map, based on the geochemistry alone, was produced. A method using Bayes ' rule was applied to combine other factors important for gold prediction with the geochemical signature. A unique conditions map shows all those areas where a unique set of overlap between the predictor maps occurs. For each unique condition, an a posteriors probability was calculated, resulting in a map depicting probability of gold mineralization. This map confirms that the major known gold districts coincide with areas of high probability. Several new areas of high potential are indicated by the model, although exploration follow-up has not yet been carried out...|$|E
