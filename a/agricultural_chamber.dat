50|$|At first, CZ.NIC had {{fulfilled}} {{the role of}} both registry administrator and the registrar. A fundamental change in this respect occurred in 2002, {{when there was a}} transition to more efficient decentralized domain administration. Thanks to this transition, other entities could enter the domain registration process. The aim of this measure was to separate the technical aspects of the operation of the registration system from the operation by domain names’ end holders and to introduce competitive environment, which would bring better services and lower prices, into the registration process. The decentralized domain administration system started its operation in autumn of 2003 and was immediately entered by first commercial registrars. Apart from commercial environment and price decrease, the decentralized system has brought other intriguing changes. The users have been enabled to register domains for a period longer than one year (up to 10 years), and the system have been further secured, in particular with respect to domain holder’s rights. Due to the decentralization and making domains accessible to public, domain disputes have become a frequent occurrence. That is why the association introduced an arbitration clause into the Registration Rules in 2004. This clause allows for resolving disputes through Arbitration Court attached to the Chamber of Commerce and the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Czech Republic. The registration now includes accepting the commitment to respect the decisions of the Arbitration Court, which has simplified and accelerated the dispute resolution.|$|E

In 1997 and 1999, he interned as an agro-economist at the European Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in Brussels, helping prepare the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD). In 1998-1999, he directed a local rural development programme in Argeș County, again cooperating with Savoie. From 1999 to 2001, he worked at two agricultural development agencies in France, coordinating joint programmes with Romania in that field. From 2002 to 2003, as part of the European Commission's delegation to Romania, he helped manage SAPARD's implementation in his native country. From January 2005 to May 2007, he was an adviser to Romania's Agriculture Minister, and a representative in the Council of the European Union's Special Committee on Agriculture. From May to October 2007, he was undersecretary of state for European affairs at the ministry. Following the resignation of Decebal Traian Remeș due to a corruption scandal, he was appointed Agriculture Minister in October 2007, serving until the following December, when Tăriceanu's National Liberal Party-led government left office after a parliamentary election.

50|$|The {{origins of}} Moredun {{go back to}} the years {{following}} World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and <b>Agricultural</b> Society’s <b>chambers</b> in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute.

Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.|$|R

In this study, {{an inventory of}} white grub (Melolontha melolontha, Amphimallon solstitiale and Phyllopertha horticola) damages in Austrian grassland including organic cultivation was performed by questioning plant protection consultants of 74 <b>Agricultural</b> County <b>Chambers.</b> Altogether, a cumulated 14. 800 hectares of white grub damages were recorded. From 2000 onwards, a steady increase of white grub damages occurred with a climax {{in the year of}} heat and drought 2003. The infested fields extended along the alpine main ridge from Vorarlberg up to the alpine foreland. Additionally, southern slopes of the Danube valley in Upper and Lower Austria were affected. Very likely, the damages were mainly due to the garden chafer P. horticola. From 2004 to 2006, the extent of damages decreased again all over Austria. By studying meteorological data, it became obvious that the damaged areas were mainly situated in regions with a strong precipitation deficit. On-farm investigations performed in 2007 strengthened the hypothesis that drought and elevated soil temperatures might be the decisive factors for a strong development of grub populations and subsequent feeding damages. Additionally, drought can increase the effects of grub damage by delaying the regeneration of the damaged sward. A strongly damaged sward on slopes can be dangerous for the farmers e. g. by slipping machines...|$|R

The book is divided into three main parts, following the pattern of the workshop. After the foreword by Robert Chambers, the co-author of the first book, Part 1 deals with theoretical reflections on knowledge, and power and practice, which is followed by a detailed discussion of methodological innovations, applications and challenges in Part II. The book concludes with an examination of processes for transforming institutions and changing policies (Part Ill). The book shows that since the time of Farmer first there has been a significant shift of emphasis and a radical rethinking of participatory approaches to farming systems, and in the application of both indigenous and western science-based technological knowledge.

40|$|Dual {{production}} specifications derived under certainty {{are typically}} randomized for econometric purposes with ad hoc error specifications. This article shows that such approaches can cause inte-grability conditions to fail. In particular, if errors in input demands represent errors in optimization that affect output, then typical dual approaches do not yield congruent supplies and demands. Key words: dual methodology, errors in optimization, {{supply and demand}} estimation, uncertainty. The application of profit functions to specify input demands and output supplies has become commonplace in <b>agricultural</b> eco-nomic research (<b>Chambers).</b> The typical sin-gle output application defines a restricted profit function of the form = Gwp z where G is monotonic, linearly homoge-neous, and convex in an n-vector of input prices w and a scalar output price p, and z represents conditioning of the production set on time, technology, and fixed factors. Consistent specifications for factor demands and output supplies follow by the envelope theorem. To rationalize random errors necessary for estimation, may be randomized as = Gwp z+p+w, where is a scalar dis-turbance and is an n-vector of disturbances both with zero means. 1 Thus, Hotelling’s Lemma applied to yields output sup-ply y ∗ =Gpwp z+ E = 0, and input demands x ∗ = −Gwwp z −, where sub-scripts denote differentiation (Shumway). 2 These common representations are attractive because they are straightforward and have given fairly sensible answers to meaning-ful questions of input substitution, functional structure, bias in technical change, productiv-ity growth, and supply response...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{flow-through}} chamber {{system has}} been developed {{in response to a}} need to measure emissions of nitrogen, sulphur, and carbon compounds for a variety of field applications. The cylindrical chamber system is constructed of chemically inert materials and internally lined with 5 mil thick transparent fluorinated ethylene polypropylene (FEP) Teflon to reduce chemical reactions and build up of temperature inside the chamber. The chamber (diameter = 27 cm, height = 42 cm, volume = 24. 05 L) is designed with an open-ended bottom that can penetrate either soil or liquid to a depth of ~ 6 - 8 cm, thus creating a completely enclosed system. Carrier gas (e. g. compressed zero-grade air) is pumped at a constant flow rate (~ 2 to ~ 5 lpm), depending on the season. The air inside the chamber is well mixed by a variable-speed, motor-driven Teflon impeller (~ 40 to ~ 100 rpm). Many different laboratory and field experiments have been conducted using this dynamic chamber system. Oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO 2, NOy) emissions have been measured from agricultural soils where nitrogen-rich fertilizers have been applied. Ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) and reduced organic sulphur compounds emissions have been measured using this same technique across a gas-liquid interface at swine waste treatment anaerobic storage lagoons, and <b>agricultural</b> fields. Similar <b>chamber</b> systems have also been deployed to measure uptake of nitrogen, sulphur, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide gases by crops and vegetation to examine atmospheric-biospheric interactions. Emissions measurements have been validated by a coupled gas-liquid transfer with chemical reaction model as well as a U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WATER 9 model...|$|R
