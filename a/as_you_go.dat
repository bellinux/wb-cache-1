25|$|Oyster Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> (PAYG) and {{contactless}} {{payments are}} accepted on journeys within London Travelcard zones.|$|E
25|$|The Oyster card is a {{contactless}} {{smart card}} system introduced for the public in 2003, {{which can be used}} to pay individual fares (pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go)</b> or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader. Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.|$|E
25|$|A further {{system failure}} {{occurred}} {{two weeks later}} on 25 July 2008, when pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> cards were not read properly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has he {{not come}} to search for new lands here, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to search for them there?" [...] asked Toolooha, {{pointing}} alternately north and south.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told our}} chauffeur that I was train-giddy," [...] said Fleur. [...] "Did you look pretty natural <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> out?" [...] "I don't know. What is natural?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At {{the top of}} {{the tree}} you will find two cocoa-nuts. You must not throw them down, but carry them in your hands; and <b>you</b> must descend <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> up, using your legs only.' ...|$|R
25|$|Alternatively, a new Oyster {{card with}} Auto top-up and {{a minimum of}} £10 pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> can be ordered via Oyster online.|$|E
25|$|The fantail stern {{describes}} a stern {{that has a}} stern that starts at the water and widens <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> upwards. This is famous on many 19th century tea clippers and the ill-fated RMS Titanic.|$|E
25|$|At the launch, TfL {{undertook}} {{to revamp the}} routes by improving service frequencies, staffing all stations, improving station facilities, introducing new rolling stock and allowing Oyster pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> throughout the network from the outset.|$|E
6000|$|Altamont stuttered and stammered and hemd, and hawd. [...] "O!" [...] says he, [...] "I was passing--passing <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> in and out." [...] And he {{instantly}} {{turned the}} conversation, and {{began talking about}} pollytix, or the weather, or some such stuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Lady Mary Maclean? I {{need not}} ask after her. She never misses, I know; {{and you must}} have seen her. She {{must have been in}} your own circle; for <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur, round the orchestra, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She give me {{this at the}} station--Miss Mannering did," [...] she gasped, [...] "and {{asked me}} {{to give it to}} you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see. I couldn't get a chanst when you was in, but <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> I slipped out by the porch door and {{followed}} <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>went</b> so fast I near died trying to head you off." ...|$|R
25|$|On 10 March 2005 an {{incorrect}} data table {{meant that the}} Oyster system was inoperable during the morning rush hour. Ticket barriers had to be left open and pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> fares could not be collected.|$|E
25|$|Leap card, a prepaid {{smartcard}} {{which can}} be used for pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> travel in the Dublin area. It offers discounts over standard on bus cash fares and can also be used on Iarnród Éireann and Luas services.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} {{alternative}} way {{to demonstrate the}} winner of the Schulze method. This method is equivalent to the others described here, but the presentation is optimized for the significance of steps being visually apparent <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> through it, not for computation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mistress Nellie, {{you have}} been deceived. This fellow is no lord. He is a hanger-on of the Court, one John Harvey, a disreputable blackguard whom I heard boasting to his boon-companions of his conquest. I implore you to return home <b>as</b> quietly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went.</b> None will know of this." ...|$|R
6000|$|Penelope's {{tears were}} all spent. [...] "Well, mother," [...] she said, [...] "you come back almost <b>as</b> cheerful <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> away. I needn't ask if 'Rene's in good spirits. We {{all seem to}} be {{overflowing}} with them. I suppose {{this is one way}} of congratulating me. Mrs. Corey hasn't been round to do it yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head. [...] "It {{would be the}} same again <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> away." [...] I could not conceal my distress, and she went on: [...] "Now, you mustn't mind what I say. I'm nothing but a silly old woman, and Eveleth would never forgive me if she could know what I've been saying." ...|$|R
25|$|We {{know that}} U.S. embassy {{officials}} were compiling lists {{of thousands of}} names of public figures in Indonesia and handing these to the army and saying, 'Kill everybody on these lists and check off the names <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> and give the lists back to us when you’re done'.|$|E
25|$|The Gables Guest House & Leisure Centre {{is located}} on Ryston, Kilcullen Road, Newbridge. It offers {{facilities}} such as indoor heated 20m swimming pool, modern gym, fully qualified fitness instructors and lifeguards, aerobic studio, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and ice cold plunge room. Annual membership is available as well as pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until the {{availability}} of Oyster pay-as-you-go on {{the whole of the}} National Rail suburban network in January 2010, the validity of PAYG was not consistent across different modes of transport within London, and this gave rise to confusion for Oyster pay-as-you-go users. Many passengers were caught out trying to use Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on rail routes where it was not valid.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} {{we arrived in}} time, Tim," [...] Ralph said. [...] "And it's lucky for you that you shouted 'Hurrah for old Ireland!' <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> down; for of course {{we had no idea}} you were a countryman and, {{although}} we were disgusted at the brutality of that cowardly mob, we could hardly have interfered between them and a German spy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't write <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> on hearsay evidence. Speak of proofs--irrefragable proofs--and {{then you}} convict him at once, without power of eluding you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The early U.S. rocket {{programs}} were named for enlisted {{ranks in the}} United States Army: Private, Corporal, and Sergeant. When, {{in the words of}} former JPL director William Hayward Pickering, researchers [...] "came along with this sounding rocket which really didn't fit the pattern" [...] of [...] "getting bigger <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> along", the rocket [...] "was named after the Women’s Army Corps (WAC)".|$|R
25|$|Whenever the pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> balance falls below £10, £20 or £40 {{is added}} to the balance {{automatically}} when the Oyster card is touched on an entry validator. A light on the Oyster reader flashes to indicate the Auto top-up has taken place and an email is sent to confirm the transaction. Payment is then taken from the registered debit or credit card.|$|E
25|$|By June 2010 over 34million cards {{have been}} issued of which around 7million are in regular use. More than 80% of all tube {{journeys}} and more than 90% of all bus journeys use Oyster. Around 38% of all Tube journeys and 21% of all bus journeys are made using Oyster pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> Use of single tickets has declined and stands at roughly 1.5% of all bus journeys and 3% of all Tube journeys.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of Oyster pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on the National Rail commuter rail network in London was phased in gradually {{over a period}} of about six years (see Roll-out history). Since January 2010, PAYG has been valid on all London suburban rail services which accept Travelcards. Additionally, PAYG may be used at a selected number of stations which lie just outside the zones. New maps were issued in January 2010 which illustrates where PAYG is now valid.|$|E
6000|$|... "N-no. I want to {{talk this}} over, Porter. I--that is--let us come to terms--that's the best way. It won't do you any good {{to try to get}} me into trouble. I--I haven't done {{anything}} wrong. I was out on the river by--by accident, that's all--got it into my head to have a lark that night, just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> out for a lark last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it 'bout {{time you}} made a move at the Canopus?" [...] he said. [...] "So far <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>gone,</b> <b>you</b> have only spoiled my hand. <b>You</b> didn't <b>go</b> there to build Devine flumes and dams." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, in my soul. But I'll admit my legs aren't {{as young}} <b>as</b> yours. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> {{and get some}} fresh air, Anne. You look pale lately." ...|$|R
25|$|Ticketing is {{intended}} to be integrated with the other London transport systems, and Oyster pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> will be valid. Travelcards will be valid within Greater London {{with the exception of the}} Heathrow branch, which will continue to be subject to special fares. Crossrail has often been compared to Paris' RER system due to the length of the central tunnel. Crossrail will be integrated with the London Underground and National Rail networks, and it is planned to include it on the standard London Underground Map.|$|E
25|$|Harmonic {{functions}} {{that arise in}} physics are determined by their singularities and boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet boundary conditions or Neumann boundary conditions). On regions without boundaries, adding the real or imaginary part of any entire function will produce a harmonic function with the same singularity, so {{in this case the}} harmonic function is not determined by its singularities; however, we can make the solution unique in physical situations by requiring that the solution goes to 0 <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to infinity. In this case, uniqueness follows by Liouville's theorem.|$|E
25|$|O you, my lovely boy, {{who hold}} in your power Time's {{hour-glass}} and his sickle—you who wane {{as you grow}} older and in that show your friends withering as you yourself grow up: if Nature, sovereign mistress over chaos, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> onwards will ever pluck you back, she keeps you to demonstrate her power to hold up time. Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E
