5|$|In 1882, Stainer {{was offered}} the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a {{position}} he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio Mary Magdalen. This was followed in 1887 by The Crucifixion, the work {{for which he is}} most remembered.|$|E
5|$|For {{his last}} two starts of the year, Fantastic Light was sent to East Asia. In November, in the Japan Cup he stayed on {{strongly}} in the closing stages to finish a close third, beaten a neck and a nose by T M Opera O and Meisho Doto. Dettori reportedly felt that the slow pace {{was the reason for}} his defeat. Despite three successive defeats, Fantastic Light still managed to end the season with a major victory. In December he was sent to Sha Tin for the Hong Kong Cup and justified favouritism by leading in the straight and staying on strongly to beat Greek Dance and Jim <b>and</b> <b>Tonic.</b> The win earned Fantastic Light top place in the Emirates World Series, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in a number of international races.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{origins of}} bitters {{can be traced}} back as far as the ancient Egyptians, who may have infused medicinal herbs in jars of wine. This practice was further developed during the Middle Ages, where the availability of distilled alcohol coincided with a renaissance in pharmacognosy, which made possible far more concentrated herbal bitters <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> preparations. Many of the various brands and styles of digestive bitters made today reflect herbal stomachic <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> preparations whose roots are claimed to be traceable back to Renaissance era pharmacopeia and traditions.|$|E

The traditional Napue gin <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> recipe that won at the IWSC is served with a Fever-Tree Indian Tonic Water, cranberries and rosemary. The rye gin is named after the Battle of Napue fought between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia close to the distillery's location in 1714 during the Great Northern War.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about {{its role in}} the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that ToM has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2017). Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.|$|E

25|$|Mixer drinks {{became popular}} {{in the second half}} of the century. Tonic water was {{originally}} quinine added to water as a prophylactic against malaria and was consumed by British officials stationed in the tropical areas of South Asia and Africa. As the quinine powder was so bitter people began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. The mixed drink gin <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin.|$|E
25|$|In Dubai, Sunline {{showed her}} {{customary}} pace {{to lead the}} field in the Duty Free (1,800 metres), but her breakaway tactics were not aided by a home straight of 600 metres.

Sunline returned to Australia to contest the All Aged Stakes against a sub-standard field, on a wet track at Randwick. Starting a hot favourite, Sunline was inexplicably - although narrowly - beaten by El Mirada and Final Fantasy, and immediately spelled.|$|E

500|$|In {{the brain}} {{the level of}} {{extracellular}} dopamine is modulated by two mechanisms: phasic <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> transmission. Phasic dopamine release, like most neurotransmitter release in the nervous system, is driven directly by action potentials in the dopamine-containing cells. Tonic dopamine transmission occurs when small amounts of dopamine are released without being preceded by presynaptic action potentials. [...] Tonic transmission is regulated {{by a variety of}} factors, including the activity of other neurons and neurotransmitter reuptake.|$|E

500|$|Whitby {{developed}} as a spa town in Georgian times when three chalybeate springs were in demand for their medicinal <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> qualities. Visitors were attracted to the town leading to the building of [...] "lodging-houses" [...] and hotels particularly on the West Cliff. Then, in 1839, the Whitby and Pickering Railway connecting Whitby to Pickering and eventually to York was built, and {{played a part in}} the town's development as a tourism destination. George Hudson, who promoted the link to York, was responsible {{for the development of the}} Royal Crescent which was partly completed. For 12 years from 1847, Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson, engineer to the Whitby and Pickering Railway, was the Conservative MP for the town promoted by Hudson as a fellow protectionist.|$|E

500|$|Other tools {{designed}} to help artists complete complicated effects included Spaces, which allowed Olaf's deconstructible parts to be moved around and rebuilt, Flourish, which allowed extra movement such as leaves and twigs to be art-directed; Snow Batcher, which helped preview the final look of the snow, especially when characters were interacting with an area of snow by walking through a volume, <b>and</b> <b>Tonic,</b> which enabled artists to sculpt their characters' hair as procedural volumes. Tonic also aided in animating fur and hair elements such as Elsa's hair, which contains 420,000 computer-generated strands, while the average number for a real human being is only 100,000. The number of character rigs in Frozen is 312 {{and the number of}} simulated costumes also reached 245 cloth rigs, which were far beyond all other Disney films to date. Fifty effects artists and lighting artists worked together on the technology to create [...] "one single shot" [...] in which Elsa builds her ice palace.

500|$|After {{living in}} a series of rented flats, in 1951 the couple moved to a house in St. John's Wood, where they sublet rooms to lodgers such as the actors Julian Mitchell and Tony Richardson. Fuelled by plenty of gin <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> to cover her shyness, Manning could be a witty {{participant}} in London's literary scene; as in childhood she was given to making boastful inventions, such as claiming a family relationship to Marie Belloc Lowndes and that she had received a marriage proposal from Anthony Burgess the morning after his wife's death. Her insecurities also showed in other ways: she was very anxious about finances, and always alert for ways to make and save money. After the war both she and Reggie were unfaithful. At parties, Reggie would regularly ask other women if they were interested in extramarital encounters, while Manning claimed to have had affairs with both William Gerhardie and Henry Green, and engaged in an unrequited pursuit of her lodger, Tony Richardson. Jerry Slattery, her doctor, became her long-term lover; her affair came as a shock to Reggie, who felt he must have disappointed his wife. However, after a difficult start, Reggie adjusted and soon became a close friend of Jerry. Manning's adultery in some ways made it easier for Reggie to justify his own frequent affairs, including his longstanding relationship with Diana Robson, who was to become his second wife. Manning never paid undue attention to his infidelities, usually responding, [...] "you know what Reggie's like". The two never contemplated divorce, believing that marriage was a lifelong commitment.|$|E
