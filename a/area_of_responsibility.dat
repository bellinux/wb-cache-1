Six other {{cyclones}} entered the CPHC <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> from the EPHC <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> In all, 17systems formed, which is two storms above normal. In addition, 9hurricanes were reported during the season, one more than average.

Shanshan made landfall on September 17 {{on the island of}} Kyūshū. The HKO issued their final track forecast on the weakening typhoon later that day as it passed out of their <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> with the peak intensity while within HKO's <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> set at 185km/h (115mph, 100kt).

5|$|Early in its duration, Isa caused light {{rainfall}} and moderate winds on Pohnpei. Later, a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation on Guam during its dry season.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere between the anti-meridian and 100°E are officially {{named by the}} Japan Meteorological Agency when they become tropical storms. However, PAGASA also names tropical cyclones that occur or develop into tropical depressions within their self-defined <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> between 5°N–25°N and 115°E-135°E. This often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two names.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. The proximity of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E
5|$|Although deep {{convection}} was displaced to {{the northwest}} of an exposed LLCC early on January 14, the JMA still upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Mekkhala, under moderate vertical wind shear offset by excellent poleward outflow. In post-season analysis, the agency upgraded the storm at 12:00 UTC on the previous day. Late on January 14, the PAGASA named the storm Amang right after it entered the Philippine <b>Area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Responsibility.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move northwestward, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 14W {{on the morning}} of September 10. Later that day, the tropical depression moved into the PAGASA <b>Area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Responsibility,</b> and was named Luis. As the system continued to strengthen, the JMA upgraded the depression to a storm at 1200 UTC and named it Shanshan, a girls' given name submitted by Hong Kong. The HKO did the same at the same time, upgrading the depression to a storm.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{tropical}} storms and hurricanes this season, {{there were four}} additional tropical depressions that {{did not make a}} landfall anywhere. Tropical Cyclone Four formed on July2 and dissipated the next day. It was {{the tropical}} cyclone to come closest to crossing 140°W and entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> this year. Tropical Cyclone Thirteen formed on September12 and lasted four days. Tropical Cyclone Seventeen formed October16 and dissipated a day later. Tropical Cyclone Nineteen, the penultimate system of the season, formed on November 1 and dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|During February 1, as Cyclone Gene {{was moving}} to the west, Gene {{recurved}} and started moving towards the south and missed Vanuatu. The next day cyclone Gene started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95km/h (60mph 10 min). This came as cyclone Gene approached 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> {{to the south of}} 25°S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand, monitors tropical cyclones, south of 25°S. As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington's <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> Cyclone Gene started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120km/h (105mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day. Gene slowly weakened {{over the next couple of}} days as it moved towards the south east. The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone Gene was finishing its extratropical transition, and had also become fully embedded within the baroclinic zone. TCWC Wellington continued to monitor the extratropical remnants of Gene until February 9, after the sustained windspeeds had dropped to below 65km/h (40mph).|$|E
