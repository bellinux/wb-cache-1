25|$|Upgrading of {{the first}} <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>plant</b> to use the 'Simplex' system took place between 1970 and 1973. Because of the {{proximity}} of the M60 motorway and the risk that deep excavations might damage it, seven of the final settling tanks were built above ground. Effluent from the <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>plant</b> was raised up {{to the level of the}} tanks by screw pumps, and the increased hydraulic head improved their performance. The upgrade also included five primary settlement tanks and eight sludge consolidation tanks. Two new sludge boats were purchased in 1971 and 1972, and a new dock was constructed on land which had formerly been used for secondary beds.|$|E
25|$|An early feature was a laboratory, where {{trials of}} various types of filter were carried out, and {{incoming}} effluent was analysed. Attempts to improve the treatment process proved successful in 1914, when two chemists, Ardern and Lockett, discovered the Activated Sludge Process, which was soon in use worldwide. A second deep level sewer, started in 1911, eventually reached the works in 1928, and {{to cope with the}} increased flows, half of the sewage was fed into a new <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>plant.</b> Three separate operating systems were installed, so that comparisons on their efficiency could be made.

25|$|A small <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>Plant</b> was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} in 1916, one of the septic tanks was converted between 1918 and 1921 to provide a larger test bed, and a permanent installation was built at Withington Sewage Works, in south Manchester. All proved to be successful, but a full-scale plant was not built at Davyhulme until {{more than ten years}} later. A second main intercepting sewer, which would link various districts in southern Manchester to Davyhulme had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1911, and construction began soon afterwards, but it took years to complete. It was extended by further Acts in 1914, 1920 and 1924, and sewage finally entered the works on 22 November 1928. To cope with the new flows, the size of the inlet works detritus tanks and screening chamber was quadrupled, and a decision was made to feed half of the output from the screening plant to a new <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>Plant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1974, the Rivers Committee, {{which had}} managed the site since its inception, ceased to be, when water and sewage {{treatment}} became {{the responsibility of}} the newly formed North West Water Authority. The organisation was subsequently privatised, and became part of United Utilities in 1995. In order to meet demands for better water quality, a pilot Biostyr plant was built in 1992, and a much larger one was completed in 1998. Innovation continued, with the commissioning of the world's largest thermal hydrolysis plant in 2013, using a new process to break down sludge, which generates methane as a by-product, enabling the site to be self-sufficient for gas and electricity. An upgrade to the <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>plant</b> began in 2014, and is expected to be completed in 2018.|$|E
25|$|The dumping of sludge {{in the sea}} {{ended in}} 1998, {{following}} a European Community Directive, and the remaining sludge boats were sold. The sludge pipeline was used to transfer sludge to Shell Green, near Widnes, where it is turned into ash, or used in agriculture. Parts of the old secondary beds became the Davyhulme Millennium Nature Reserve in 2000, and low-profile geodesic domes were built over the primary settlement tanks in 2003, {{as part of a}} £20 million odour control scheme. The works continues to be innovative. In 2013, the world's largest thermal hydrolysis plant was commissioned. Sludge is heated to 165 degrees Celsius under pressure, and the pressure is then released in a flash tank. This process breaks up complex organic substances, allowing it to be digested more easily. Large volumes of methane are a by-product, which enables the site to be self-sufficient for gas and electricity. A £200 million upgrade to the second <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> <b>Plant</b> began in 2014, and is expected to be completed in 2018. The works now handles sewage for a population of 1.2 million people, most of which is water. Income is generated from the processing of trade effluent, which accounts for 70 percent of the organic load. Its output forms around 40 percent of the ship canal below Barton Locks.|$|E

40|$|Not all {{phosphorus}} {{removed in}} <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> {{systems can be}} accounted for by polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO). A method for the qualitative and quantitative in situ characterization of PAO cell clusters and closely associated extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) is described. X-ray microanalysis was performed on samples from four <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>plants</b> situated in Pretoria, South Africa. Analyses were done by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS). Cell clusters with associated EPS on average contained between 57 and 59 % phosphorus, while EPS alone contained on average between 23 and 30 % phosphorus. Results suggest that phosphorus removal in <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> might be due not only to PAO, but also by EPS acting as a phosphorus reservoir.

25|$|So {{far there}} is limited planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} water in Morocco, given that only 21% of the collected wastewater undergoes any treatment. In 2009 {{there were more than}} 100 wastewater treatment plants in Morocco, mostly serving small and medium-sized towns located in the interior or the country. The first wastewater treatment plants in Morocco were built by small municipalities using a wide range of technologies. Because of the limited financial and technical capacities of those municipalities practically all of these 28 plants ceased functioning shortly after they were completed. This triggered a decision in 2000 to gradually transfer the responsibility for sanitation in small and medium-sized towns to the national utility ONEP. In 2009 the latter has built or {{was in the process of}} building 43 plants, mostly using the stabilization pond technology, but also one <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>plant</b> and a few trickling filter plants. The track record of operating these plants is better than for the plants operated by municipalities, partly because the predominant technology - stabilization ponds - does not require electricity. Its lower operating costs make it less vulnerable to disruptions in the case of strained operating budgets. In larger cities, only very few municipal utilities (Régies) operate wastewater treatment plants. Their track record at operating them is mixed: A plant operated by the Agadir utility works well, while plants operated by the utilities of Beni Mellal and Nador do not function. These plants use the activated sludge technology which requires electricity. The Marakkech utility was constructing a large plant in 2009, and the Fes utility was in the process of bidding for a plant. This process experienced a setback when the French development agency AFD and the European Investment Bank withdrew their financing for the plant, citing non-respect of tender procedures as the reason.|$|E
