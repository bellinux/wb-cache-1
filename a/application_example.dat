5000|$|Both {{large and}} small systems can be built using the SCADA concept. These systems can range from just tens to {{thousands}} of process loops, depending on the <b>application.</b> <b>Example</b> processes include industrial, infrastructure, and facility-based processes, as described below: ...|$|E
50|$|A famous <b>application</b> <b>example</b> is the Hilbert {{transform}}. Viewed as a multiplier, the Hilbert transform of {{a function}} f can be computed by first taking the Fourier transform of f, then multiplying by the sign function, and finally applying the inverse Fourier transform.|$|E

5000|$|As an <b>application</b> <b>example,</b> [...] {{could be}} IP packets {{received}} by a server. Each packet belongs {{to one of}} [...] IP flows [...] The weight [...] can be the load imposed by flow [...] on the server. Thus, [...] represents the total load imposed on the server by all the flows to which packets [...] belong.|$|E
50|$|Incompressible 2D flows {{were first}} studied in (Oñate, Sacco & Idelsohn, 2000) using a {{projection}} method stabilized through the FIC technique. A {{detailed analysis of}} this approach {{was carried out in}} (Sacco, 2002). Outstanding achievements from that work have given the FPM a more solid base; among them, the definition of local and normalized approximation bases, a procedure for constructing local clouds of points based on local Delaunay triangulation, and a criterion for evaluating the quality of the resultant approximation. The numerical applications presented focused mainly on two-dimensional (viscous and inviscid) incompressible flows, but a three-dimensional <b>application</b> <b>example</b> was also provided.|$|E
50|$|Image {{collection}} summarization {{is another}} <b>application</b> <b>example</b> of automatic summarization. It consists in selecting a representative set of images {{from a larger}} set of images. A summary {{in this context is}} useful to show the most representative images of results in an image collection exploration system. Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video. This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want to skip the boring or repetitive actions. Similarly, in surveillance videos, one would want to extract important and suspicious activity, while ignoring all the boring and redundant frames captured.|$|E

50|$|The MCSGP {{process can}} result in purities and yields {{comparable}} to those of purification using Protein A. The second <b>application</b> <b>example</b> for the MCSGP prototype is the separation of three MAb variants using a preparative weak cation-exchange resin. Although the intermediately eluting MAb variant can only be obtained with 80% purity at recoveries close to zero in a batch chromatographic process, the MCSGP process can provide 90% purity at 93% yield. A numerical comparison of the MCSGP process with the batch chromatographic process, and a batch chromatographic process including ideal recycling, has been performed using an industrial polypeptide purification as the model system. It shows that the MCSGP process can increase the productivity by a factor of 10 and reduce the solvent requirement by 90%.|$|E
5000|$|Pearce {{is adamant}} that CMM {{is not just}} an interpretive theory but is meant to be a {{practical}} theory as well. There is extensive literature involving the use of CMM to address family violence, intra-community relations, workplace conflict and many other social issues. A research employs CMM to understand the [...] "perceived acts of discrimination manifested within the context of everyday interactions." [...] By applying CMM into research, the researchers are able to explicate the rules of meaning-making that majority and minority groups followed in understanding the discrimination act. Another <b>application</b> <b>example</b> was done in 1994 when CMM was initially recognized by people. It believes that the framework of CMM provides an understanding of [...] "the structure and process of consumer decision making by placing those decisions {{within the context of a}} family's social reality".|$|E
5000|$|Specification 3.0 also {{describes}} how {{more than two}} devices can be connected by OpenTherm. Whilst OpenTherm is a point-to-point connection, an extra device (gateway) is added between the master and the slave. This gateway has 1 slave and 1 (or more) master interfaces. The gateway controls which data is passed to each slave.An <b>application</b> <b>example</b> is a room temperature controller connected to a heat recovery unit, which is connected to a boiler. The heat recovery unit is then functioning as gateway.In another possible configuration, a thermostat or room controller is connected to a sequencer with further Opentherm interfaces connected {{to more than one}} boiler. The room controller can be a standard unit, since it only 'sees' one heat-producer. The sequencer includes additional software to increase or decrease the number of running boilers to match the actual heat demand. The sequencer also needs a sensor to measure the temperature of the combined output from the boilers and usually would also control a main circulation pump. What happens after a fault occurs (resequencing remaining units, passing fault messages through for display on the room controller, etc.) is also part of the sequencer functionality. (The hydraulic design of such a system must also take account of different combinations of boilers running at the same time: a Low Loss Header / Hydraulic Separator is usually included to combine the flows from the boilers.) ...|$|E
