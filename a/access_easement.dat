40|$|Offers to Dedicate (OTDs) are {{required}} by the Coastal Commission {{as a condition of}} receiving a coastal development permit. These are only offers and the interest remains with the landowner until the OTDs are accepted by any government agency or a nonprofit agency. The purpose of the OTDs is to mitigate the impact of the proposed project on the public’s ability to access the coast. Since most of these easements were generated between 1980 and 1986 and court cases in 1987 - 89 challenged the relationship between the “exaction” and the development and have made it almost impossible for the Commission to require any more of these public <b>access</b> <b>easements,</b> the OTDs that the California Coastal Commission has now are very crucial. However, not all the OTDs have to be given the same priority in opening them to the public. This study creates a comprehensive GIS database whose need was identified in the Coastal Commission’s Public Access Action Plan. It also formulates a method of ranking the OTDs based on a scoring method that considers three criteria: date of expiration, proximity to an existing access point as well as topography of the location. These result in a feasibility score and subsequently a priority index that ranks the OTDs as highest, high, medium and low priority for opening as access for the public...|$|R
5000|$|By 2008 {{the city}} and the state were {{conducting}} a joint study researching whether the TDCJ should close the Central Unit and sell the land. Mayor of Sugar Land Dave Wallace said [...] "Let's just say that a prison is not the highest and best use for that land right now." [...] During that year the TDCJ granted the prison's <b>access</b> <b>easements</b> to the City of Sugar Land. By 2009 the City of Sugar Land had already zoned the land that the prison currently occupies to a light industrial commercial park zone. Allen Bogard, the City Manager of Sugar Land, said that he believed that the Central Unit property [...] "has a much higher purpose and value to the state of Texas to be utilized for economic development purposes." [...] Some Sugar Land residents supported the idea of the prison leaving. Some residents feared that sexually oriented businesses such as strip clubs could open in a light industrial commercial park zone formed by the absence of the prison. By 2009 the airport received a $2 million grant for airport expansion, and the grant could be used to buy the prison property. In 2009 the State of Texas authorized the purchase of the Smithville portion by the City of Sugar Land. If the prison closes, the TDCJ would lose the Central Unit's 1,060 prisoner beds.|$|R
40|$|Adopting {{land use}} {{regulations}} that encourage solar and other clean energy systems {{is an essential}} strategy for promoting clean power and one {{that focuses on the}} essential role that local governments play in mitigating climate change. This article explores efforts {{at the state and local}} level to reform zoning and land use regulations to permit, encourage, require, and incentivize rapidly-evolving clean energy systems, particularly solar, that, in the aggregate, have the ability to significantly increase power generation and decrease carbon emissions. The article illustrates how zoning, as it approaches its 100 th anniversary, is encrusted with provisions that prohibit or discourage clean and solar energy systems: barriers that are being removed by progressive communities, some more successfully than others. It describes these barriers, then provides a framework and best practice examples for revising zoning codes and other land use regulations, first to eliminate regulatory barriers to permitting clean energy systems, focusing on solar as an example, and then to require and incentivize clean energy system deployment. Included is a review of the common law of solar <b>access</b> <b>easements</b> that helps explain the importance of the legislative powers of local government to facilitate solar power generation. The article concludes with an endorsement of state and federal actions that increase the speed of local adoption of zoning reforms by providing critical support, consistent with new scholarly findings that demonstrate how top down governmental influences can facilitate bottom-up progress, charting a strategy applicable to many other local initiatives to accommodate a wide array of emerging clean energy systems...|$|R
5000|$|The Nollans owned beachfront {{property}} in Ventura County, and wished {{to replace a}} 504 sq ft bungalow which had fallen into disrepair with a 2500 sq ft house. As a condition for permits to do so, the California Coastal Commission required that the Nollans dedicate for 20 years a strip of land along the beach {{in front of their}} house to allow the public the right of pass and re-pass along the beach (to be enacted only when a public agency agreed to accept management of the ambulatory lateral-access easement). 43 neighbors had granted such easements without litigation; the Nollans, however, believed that the demand was an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation, and filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus asking the Ventura County Superior Court to invalidate the easement stipulation. The CCC argued that the new house would increase blockage of the ocean view and contribute to a “wall of residential structures” which would prevent the public “psychologically from realizing a stretch of coastline exists nearby that they have every right to visit". The Nollans could offset this burden to the public, the CCC argued, by providing additional access to the beach {{in the form of a}} dedicated <b>access</b> <b>easement</b> along the beachfront side of their property. The Superior Court ruled in favor of the Nollans, declaring “the Commission could impose access conditions on development permits for replacement homes only where the proposed development would have an adverse impact on public access to the sea, and this requirement was not met" [...] (Mandelker 124).|$|E

40|$|Firestone, Jeremy M. The {{cornerstone}} of public beach access {{in the state}} of Texas is the Texas Open Beaches Act (OBA). Enacted in 1959, it guarantees the public the right to access the public beaches of the state. The OBA also relies upon a dynamic public <b>access</b> <b>easement</b> that shifts along with the line of vegetation, often known as a ???rolling easement???. A 2010 challenge to the OBA involving a dispute between government action and private property rights, Severance v. Patterson, resulted in a Texas Supreme Court decision that limits the application of the rolling easement to the Gulf of Mexico coastline and potentially impacts the state???s ability to consistently manage beach access for the public. A review of the legal and regulatory framework of public beach access in Texas provides a background for an analysis of beach access provision in three states that have been identified as potential alternatives for applying the rolling easement in Texas to the entire Gulf of Mexico coastline under common or constitutional law. The development and application of these methods in each state was reviewed, and the application of these methods to the regulatory framework in Texas was assessed for their potential to serve as a valid state defense against Fifth Amendment takings claims from private property owners. The analysis of the alternative beach access methods shows that none of these methods will be successful at applying the rolling easement to the entire Gulf of Mexico coastline under the OBA, but would rather serve as tools for providing beach access to individual parcels affected by the Severance v. Patterson decision. When combined with proactive public policy designed to mitigate development in hazard prone areas, these methods could close some of the gaps in beach access provision that were opened by the Severance v. Patterson decision. University of Delaware, Department of Marine StudiesM. S...|$|E

40|$|Disputes about {{easements}} {{can have}} a huge emotional and financial cost to Tasmanians. This is highlighted by {{the way in which}} this project {{came to the attention of}} the Institute. In suggesting a review of the law of easements, a member of the public detailed the significant emotional, personal and financial costs involved in a dispute about the use of a right of way. Ultimately, this dispute led the dominant owner to sell their property and move. Underlying this dispute is a stark reminder of the need for rights attaching to land to be easily identifiable and clearly understood. This paper highlights a number of problems associated with easements in Tasmania. First, it asks whether the law on <b>access</b> to an <b>easement</b> should be clarified. Good neighbourly relations can be destroyed if the expectation of the dominant and servient owner in respect of use of the easement differ greatly. A clearer delineation of when and how an easement can be used may well eliminate many of the disputes that presently occur. In addition, the paper asks whether an inexpensive dispute resolution mechanism should be formalised within the legislation...|$|R
