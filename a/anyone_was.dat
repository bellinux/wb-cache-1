5|$|Alston's Dodgers {{teams of}} the 1960s {{benefited from the}} strong {{pitching}} by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more money than <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games. Koufax retired after the season {{on the advice of}} doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if <b>anyone,</b> <b>was</b> {{in charge of}} the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E

Among other questions, they were attempting to find out what training Abdulmutallab received, who else (if <b>anyone)</b> <b>was</b> in the training program, were others preparing to launch similar attacks, was the attack part of a larger plot, was it a test run, and who assisted him.|$|E

5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

25|$|In early Islamic history, after Muhammad's death, the {{declaration}} of Prophethood by <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> automatically deemed to be proof of apostasy.

25|$|In {{the view}} of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the {{province}} of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals {{with a set of}} learned skills.

The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.|$|E

25|$|On 18 March 1861, the {{congregation}} moved permanently {{to the newly}} constructed purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, Southwark, seating 5000 people with standing room for another 1000. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the largest church edifice of its day. Spurgeon continued to preach there several times per week until his death 31 years later. He never gave altar calls {{at the conclusion of}} his sermons, but he always extended the invitation that if <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> moved to seek an interest in Christ by his preaching on a Sunday, they could meet with him at his vestry on Monday morning.

25|$|On 29 November 1996, the CBI {{issued the}} first final report. The {{author of the}} report, A.K. Ohri, stated {{that he could not}} {{determine}} whether Abhaya's death was suicide or homicide. The report was not accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court. On 9 July 1999, the CBI issued a second final report authored by Surinder Paul. Paul concluded that Abahya's death was a homicide, but he could not establish the identity of the perpetrators. Paul's report was also not accepted by the court. On 25 August 2005, the CBI issued yet another report, authored by R.R. Sahay. Sahay concluded that there was no indication that <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> involved in Abahya's death. The report was again not accepted. On 4 September 2008, the court turned the investigation over to the Kerala branch of the CBI.|$|E
25|$|The Social Credit {{government}} {{did away with}} the Instant-runoff voting system, {{that had been in}} place in the rural constituencies, and the Single Transferable Vote system in Edmonton and Calgary, both of which had been in place since 1924. The move was made to standardize and simplify voting results across the province. Under single transferable vote and instant-runoff voting, results would take up to five days to count all the possible vote transfers, before <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> declared elected. This was especially problematic, in Edmonton that elected seven members. As well, the government in 1955 had lost a few members in rural constituencies due to IRV, when they had received the largest portion of the vote in the constituency but were not elected to the seat after re-distribution of the ballots in the second round. The cancellation of IRV system was meant to prevent this in the future.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} teams set, the {{logistics}} of hosting the first American football game in the Soviet Union proved challenging. Soviet officials {{were not used to}} the requirements of major American football teams: i.e., the locker rooms in the stadium were designed for 16-player soccer teams, not football teams with over 75 personnel, and Soviet stadiums did not have communications between booths and the field commonly used by coordinators. Some Soviets were even interested if <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> ever killed during the games. In addition, Dynamo Stadium's grass field was 10 yards too short to meet football specifications. Plans were made in case any unexpected flare-up in the fading Cold War prevented the game from being played in the Soviet Union; the contingency plan had the game to be moved to Los Angeles and USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, with Illinois still splitting the gate.|$|E

25|$|Bazaine took {{no part in}} {{the earlier}} battles, but after the defeats of Marshal MacMahon’s French Forces at Wörth and Marshal Canrobert’s at Forbach, Napoleon III (who was in {{increasingly}} poor health) was swift to give Bazaine the title of Commander-in-Chief of the French Army on 13 August 1870. At the time, Napoleon’s choice {{was considered to be}} a wise one. It was widely believed by French politicians and soldiers alike, that if <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> capable of saving France from the Prussian onslaught, it was “notre glorieux Bazaine” ("our glorious Bazaine"). He was the only remaining Marshal of France not to have suffered defeat at the hands of Prussian forces in the early weeks of the war. However, being the youngest of the French Marshals, Napoleon’s choice was met with suspicion and jealousy by the older, socially superior Marshals. Hence it was with reluctance that he took up the chief command, and his tenure became the central act in the tragedy of 1870. He found the army in retreat, ill-equipped and numerically at a great disadvantage, and the generals and officers discouraged and distrustful of one another. Bazaine's solution was to bring back his army to Metz. The day after assuming command of the Army, on 14 August at Borny he was badly wounded by a shell on the left shoulder, a fact which was to be excluded from his service roll presented at his Court Martial in 1873.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} and still {{by the end}} of the war, {{considerable}} controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if <b>anyone,</b> <b>was</b> to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to review all the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a 'staff appreciation' of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I 'read it with increasing wonder till at last I felt it my duty to convey to the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict'. The account was classified as 'secret' and yet another version was commissioned, the 'Admiralty Narrative'. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty's, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.|$|E
