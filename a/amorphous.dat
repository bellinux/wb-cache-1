5|$|The <b>amorphous</b> form {{of boron}} nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any long-distance {{regularity}} in {{the arrangement of}} its atoms. It is analogous to <b>amorphous</b> carbon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amorphous</b> boron {{is used as}} {{a melting}} point {{depressant}} in nickel-chromium braze alloys.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} green flame, <b>amorphous</b> boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic flares.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is {{employed}} to saturate broken ("dangling") bonds of <b>amorphous</b> silicon and <b>amorphous</b> carbon that helps stabilizing material properties. It {{is also a}} potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including ZnO, SnO2, CdO, MgO, ZrO2, HfO2, La2O3, Y2O3, TiO2, SrTiO3, LaAlO3, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrSiO4, HfSiO4, and SrZrO3.|$|E
5|$|Sources: <b>amorphous</b> BN, {{crystalline}} BN, graphite, diamond.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an <b>amorphous</b> structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully <b>amorphous,</b> while others have a partially crystalline/partially <b>amorphous</b> structure. Both <b>amorphous</b> and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium carbonate, Dy2(CO3)3, and {{dysprosium}} sulfate, Dy2(SO4)3, {{result from}} similar reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy2(C2O4)3·10H2O) are both insoluble in water. Two {{of the most}} abundant dysprosium carbonates, tengerite-(Dy) (Dy2(CO3)3·2–3H2O) and kozoite-(Dy) (DyCO3(OH)) are known to form via a poorly ordered (<b>amorphous)</b> precursor phase with a formula of Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O. This <b>amorphous</b> precursor consists of highly hydrated spherical nanoparticles of 10–20nm diameter that are exceptionally stable under dry treatment at ambient and high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|However, {{further studies}} of the visible and near {{infrared}} spectra suggest a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1:1 mixture of <b>amorphous</b> and crystalline ice, together {{with no more than}} 8% organics. The absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and the observations confirm that the collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago, in agreement with the dynamic studies.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a {{team at the}} North Carolina State University {{announced}} the development of another allotrope they have dubbed Q-carbon, created by a high energy low duration laser pulse on <b>amorphous</b> carbon dust. Q-carbon is reported to exhibit ferromagetism, fluorescence, and a hardness superior to diamonds.|$|E
5|$|In appearance, {{all forms}} of this {{coenzyme}} are white <b>amorphous</b> powders that are hygroscopic and highly water-soluble. The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD are colorless and stable {{for about a week}} at 4°C and neutral pH, but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis. Upon decomposition, they form products that are enzyme inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Layers of <b>amorphous</b> {{boron nitride}} (a-BN) {{are used in}} some {{semiconductor}} devices, e.g. MISFETs. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of trichloroborazine with caesium, or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.|$|E
5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, <b>amorphous</b> aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in {{a substantial part of}} the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{selenide}} was {{the first}} material for blue LEDs, but gallium nitride is dominating the market now. Cadmium selenide was an important component in quantum dots. Sheets of <b>amorphous</b> selenium convert X-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel X-ray cameras. Ionized selenium (Se+24) {{is one of the}} active mediums used in X-ray lasers.|$|E
25|$|Important polymer glasses include <b>amorphous</b> and glassy {{pharmaceutical}} compounds. These {{are useful}} because the solubility {{of the compound}} is greatly increased when it is <b>amorphous</b> compared to the same crystalline composition. Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline forms.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the same}} atoms {{may be able}} to form noncrystalline phases. For example, water can also form <b>amorphous</b> ice, while SiO2 can form both fused silica (an <b>amorphous</b> glass) and quartz (a crystal). Likewise, if a {{substance}} can form crystals, it can also form polycrystals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amorphous</b> silica {{consists}} of kieselgur (diatomite), from the skeletons of diatoms, and vitreous silica, produced by heating and then rapid cooling of crystalline silica. <b>Amorphous</b> silica is less toxic than crystalline, but not biologically inert, and diatomite, when heated, can convert to tridymite or cristobalite.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amorphous</b> silicon is {{the most}} {{well-developed}} thin film technology to-date. An <b>amorphous</b> silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. <b>Amorphous</b> silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).|$|E
25|$|Under {{extremes}} of pressure and temperature solids may exhibit large structural and physical changes {{that can lead}} to polyamorphic phase transitions. In 2006 Italian scientists created an <b>amorphous</b> phase of carbon dioxide using extreme pressure. The substance was named <b>amorphous</b> carbonia(a-CO2) and exhibits an atomic structure resembling that of silica.|$|E
25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of <b>amorphous,</b> crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an <b>amorphous</b> oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The <b>amorphous</b> oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E
25|$|A {{parameter}} {{of particular}} interest in synthetic polymer manufacturing is the glass transition temperature (Tg), at which <b>amorphous</b> polymers undergo a transition from a rubbery, viscous liquid, to a brittle, glassy <b>amorphous</b> solid on cooling. The glass transition temperature may be engineered by altering the degree of branching or crosslinking in the polymer or {{by the addition of}} plasticizer.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the more}} unusual body {{materials}} are <b>amorphous</b> silicon, polycrystalline silicon or other <b>amorphous</b> semiconductors in thin-film transistors or organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) {{that are based}} on organic semiconductors; often, OFET gate insulators and electrodes are made of organic materials, as well. Such FETs are manufactured using a variety of materials such as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Amorphous</b> oxide has a {{dielectric}} {{ratio of}} ~ 1.4nm/V. Compared to crystalline aluminum oxide, {{which has a}} dielectric ratio of ~1.0nm/V, the <b>amorphous</b> variety has a 40% lower capacitance at the same anode surface. The disadvantage of crystalline oxide is its greater sensitivity to tensile stress, which may lead to microcracks when subjected to mechanical (winding) or thermal (soldering) stressors during the post-forming processes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{plastics}} {{are completely}} <b>amorphous,</b> such as: all thermosets; polystyrene and its copolymers; and polymethyl methacrylate.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of large}} {{crystals}} include snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt. Most inorganic solids are not crystals but polycrystals, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused {{together into a}} single solid. Examples of polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. A third category of solids is <b>amorphous</b> solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of <b>amorphous</b> solids include glass, wax, and many plastics.|$|E
25|$|Microcrystalline silica {{consists}} of minute quartz crystals bonded together with <b>amorphous</b> silica. Examples include flint and chert.|$|E
25|$|Polyamorphism is {{a similar}} {{phenomenon}} where the same atoms can exist {{in more than one}} <b>amorphous</b> solid form.|$|E
25|$|Polymers with {{microcrystalline}} {{regions are}} generally tougher (can be bent more without breaking) and more impact-resistant than totally <b>amorphous</b> polymers.|$|E
25|$|When {{allowed to}} cool slowly, the molten polymer forms a more {{crystalline}} material. This material has spherulites containing many small crystallites when crystallized from an <b>amorphous</b> solid, rather than forming one large single crystal. Light tends to scatter as it crosses {{the boundaries between}} crystallites and the <b>amorphous</b> regions between them. This scattering means that crystalline PET is opaque and white in most cases. Fiber drawing is among the few industrial processes that produce a nearly single-crystal product.|$|E
25|$|Glass is an <b>amorphous</b> solid. It {{exhibits}} {{an atomic}} structure {{close to that}} observed in the supercooled liquid phase but displays all the mechanical properties of a solid. The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over {{extended periods of time}} is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see viscosity of <b>amorphous</b> materials). Laboratory measurements of room temperature glass flow do show a motion consistent with a material viscosity on the order of 1017–1018 Pa s.|$|E
25|$|Ovshinsky {{opened the}} {{scientific}} field of <b>amorphous</b> and disordered {{materials in the}} course of his research in the 1940s and 50s in neurophysiology, neural disease, the nature of intelligence in mammals and machines, and cybernetics. <b>Amorphous</b> silicon semiconductors have become the basis of many technologies and industries. Ovshinsky is also distinguished in being self-taught, without formal college or graduate training. Throughout his life, his love for science and his social convictions were the primary engines for his inventive work.|$|E
25|$|The Sanyo HIT (Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer) {{solar cell}} is {{composed}} of a mono thin crystalline silicon wafer surrounded by ultra-thin <b>amorphous</b> silicon layers.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{some authors}} {{have claimed that}} <b>amorphous</b> solids, such as glass and many polymers, are {{actually}} liquids with a very high viscosity (greater than 1012Pa·s).|$|E
25|$|Product is an <b>amorphous</b> re-granulate of an {{intrinsic}} viscosity {{in the range}} of 0.55–0.7 dℓ/g, depending on how complete pre-drying of PET flakes has been done.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic olefin {{copolymers}} {{are prepared}} by copolymerization of ethene and cycloolefins (usually norbornene) produced by using metallocene catalysts. The resulting polymers are <b>amorphous</b> polymers and particularly transparent and heat resistant.|$|E
25|$|His {{research}} {{focuses on}} cuprate superconductivity, conceptual issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, superfluidity in highly degenerate atomic gases, low temperature properties of <b>amorphous</b> solids and topological quantum computation.|$|E
25|$|When the {{temperature}} {{is higher than the}} glass transition temperature, , the activation energy of viscosity is low because <b>amorphous</b> materials are melted and have most of their joining bonds broken, which facilitates flow.|$|E
