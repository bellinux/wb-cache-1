25|$|It is {{possible}} that sea lice survive on fish that remain in the estuaries or that they transfer to an as yet unknown <b>alternate</b> <b>host</b> to spend the winter. Smolt get infected with sea lice larvae, or even possibly adults, when they enter the estuaries in the spring. It is also not known how sea lice distribute between fish in the wild. Adult stages of Lepeophtheirus spp. can transfer under laboratory conditions, but the frequency is low. Caligus spp. transfer quite readily and between different species of fish, and are regularly found in the plankton.|$|E
25|$|At its {{meeting in}} February 2009, the ICC board {{decided to move}} the tournament out of Pakistan on {{security}} concerns. At the time, Sri Lanka was the favoured <b>alternate</b> <b>host.</b> In March 2009, the ICC Chief Executives' Committee recommended to the ICC board that the tournament be held in South Africa as there were concerns that the weather in Sri Lanka during September and October could result in too many games being washed out. The ICC board ratified the recommendation, and the event took place in South Africa between 22 September and 5 October 2009. Matches will be played at Wanderers Stadium and Centurion Park, both in the Johannesburg area.|$|E

25|$|Mortality {{from white}} pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50–80% {{during the early}} 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on {{alternate}} hosts of the Ribes genus, the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the <b>alternate</b> <b>host</b> plants were removed that {{white pine blister rust}} might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants. The ramifications for wildlife and habitat ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.|$|E

40|$|White pine blister rust disease, {{caused by}} the {{introduced}} pathogen Cronartium ribicola, has severely disrupted five-needled pine ecosystems in North America. A 100 -year effort to manage this disease was predicated {{in part on the}} premise that the pathogen utilizes only species of Ribes (Grossulariaceae) as <b>alternate</b> <b>hosts</b> on this continent. The current study presents the first conclusive demonstration that some species in the family Orobanchaceae (Pedicularis racemosa and Castilleja miniata) are functioning as <b>alternate</b> <b>hosts</b> in a natural ecosystem of North America. This finding has implications for improving our understanding of epidemiology, pathogen adaptation and host–pathogen interac-tions within white pine blister rust. ...|$|R

50|$|Puccinia graminis is a macrocyclic {{heteroecious}} fungus {{that causes}} wheat stem rust disease. The repeating stage in this fungus occurs on wheat {{and not the}} <b>alternate</b> <b>host,</b> barberry. The repeating stage allows the disease to persist in wheat even though the <b>alternate</b> <b>host</b> may be removed. Planting resistant crops is the ideal form of disease prevention, however, mutations can give rise to new strains of fungi that can overcome plant resistance. Although the disease cannot be stopped by removal of the <b>alternate</b> <b>host,</b> the life cycle is disrupted {{and the rate of}} mutation is decreased because of reduced genetic recombination. This allows resistance bred crops to remain effective {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
