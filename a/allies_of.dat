50|$|Kaunitz was {{the mastermind}} of the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, that {{involved}} her dramatic shakeup of traditional military alliances in Europe. Austria went from an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Britain to an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> France and Russia. Prussia became an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain, along with Hanover. The result was the basic lineup of forces in the Seven Years' War.|$|R
5000|$|The Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 was the {{reversal}} of longstanding alliances in Europe between the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. [...] Austria went from an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Britain to an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> France, while Prussia became an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Britain.

5|$|The <b>Allies</b> <b>of</b> World War II held {{a series}} of {{military}} tribunals and trials, beginning with a trial of the major war criminals from November 1945 to October 1946. Hess was tried with this first group of 23 defendants, all of whom were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity, in violation of international laws governing warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Cripple Creek strike also {{transformed}} the Western Federation of Miners enormously {{as a political}} entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners throughout the West. Thousands of workers joined the union {{over the next few}} years. Politicians and labor officials throughout the country became steady <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the union, and the WFM became a political force throughout much of the Rocky Mountain West.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon London, called Lundenwic, {{was located}} a mile west of Roman Londinium, but Lundenwic was undefended, and the {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} inside {{the walls of the}} old Roman city, especially an area close to the River Thames now called Queenhithe, but which was then known as Æthelred's Hythe after its Mercian ruler. Æthelred moved quickly to restore the area; in 889 he and Alfred granted property there to the Bishop of Worcester, and in 899 they made another grant to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both bishops were, like Æthelred, Mercians and strong <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> King Alfred, who had the right to all tolls from markets along the river bank.|$|E

50|$|In 1787, the Mysore {{captured}} Iruvazhinadu by murdering Kurungothu Nair, {{the ruler}} of Iruvazhinadu and an old <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the French. The French then became the closest <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Mysore, continuing to supply arms to the kingdom. In the meantime, Arakkal Beebi allied with the English and Kolathiri replaced them as the <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Mysore. Kolathiri captured Randattara and Darmadom from the English. Later in 1789, however, the company recaptured Darmadom.|$|R
50|$|In 1534, the Danish Count's Feud {{spilled over}} into the Low Countries where the Guelders Wars were raging, when Habsburg {{supported}} Enno II, Count <b>of</b> East Frisia, <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Christopher of Oldenburg and Charles, Duke of Guelders supported Balthasar Oomkens von Esens, <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Christian III of Denmark.|$|R
5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption and soaring debt, became dependent on {{aid from the}} US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a palace guard with leftist sympathies. He {{was the first of}} a series of authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the US. His reversal of the reforms of his predecessors sparked a series of leftist insurgencies in the country after his death, culminating in the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960 to 1996.|$|E
5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages {{it is unlikely that the}} tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the K'iche' Maya. The growing {{power of the}} Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.|$|E
5|$|Four {{centuries of}} {{stagnation}} during Ottoman rule {{came to an}} end during World War I by the 1916 Arab Revolt; driven by long-term Arab resentment towards the Ottoman authorities, and growing Arab nationalism. The revolt was launched by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, a member of the Hashemite clan of Hejaz who claim descent from Muhammad. Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian Bedouin tribes, Circassians and Christians. The <b>Allies</b> <b>of</b> World WarI, including Britain and France, offered support.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|In 211 BC an Aetolian {{assembly}} was convened {{for discussions}} with Rome. Laevinus {{pointed out the}} recent capture of Syracuse and Capua {{in the war against}} Carthage as evidence of Rome's rising fortunes, and offered to ally with them against the Macedonians. A treaty was signed. The Aetolians would conduct operations on land, the Romans at sea. Rome would keep any slaves and other booty taken and Aetolia would receive control of any territory acquired. Another provision of the treaty allowed for the inclusion of certain <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the League: Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.|$|E
5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The <b>Allies</b> <b>of</b> World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E

Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the Uí Néill and their subjects and <b>allies.</b> <b>Of</b> the Uí Néill kings, Áed mac Ainmuirech of the Cenél Conaill, Columba's first cousin once removed, {{was the most important}} during Áedán's reign.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|In total, 43 {{individuals}} in the military of <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> Nazi Germany were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes), the highest award in the military of Nazi Germany during World War II. Eight of these men were also honoured with the next higher grade, the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, and one senior naval officer, Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was additionally awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves. Among the recipients were eighteen Romanians, nine Italians, eight Hungarians, two Slovaks, two Japanese, two Spaniards, two Finns, and one Belgian.|$|E
