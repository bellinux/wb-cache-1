The introduction of such ‘intelligent’ technologies on distribution networks, where investment in dedicated condition monitoring equipment remains difficult to justify, presents an opportunity to capture constant streams of operational data which can offer a useful insight into underlying circuit conditions if utilised and managed appropriately. The primary function of the NOJA Pole-Mounted <b>Auto-Recloser</b> (PMAR) is to isolate distribution circuits from detected faults, while attempting to minimise outages due to transient faults.

This paper details the design and development of an automated decision support system for fault diagnosis and prognosis, which can detect and diagnose evolving faults by analysing PMAR data and corresponding SCADA alarm data.

40|$|Abstract: The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) has {{implemented}} an Incentive- Based Regulation (IBR) {{scheme that}} either rewards or penalizes distributors on the System- Average Interruption-Duration Index (SAIDI) and other network performance indices [1]. The optimal placement of automatic reclosers (auto-reclosers) {{is seen as}} a cost-effective measure to reduce the system-average interruption-duration index (SAIDI) impact along a medium voltage (MV) feeder. An <b>auto-recloser</b> {{is seen as a}} function of distribution automation (DA), thus reducing customer impact. A great advantage of a correctly implemented and operated DA system can improve network reliability significantly. This dissertation evaluates the empirical relationship between recloser placement and reliability from the perspective of control and instrumentation within ESKOM. It also puts forward an additional performance-improvement framework that can be implemented to achieve RAM (Reliability, Availability and Maintainability) management. Loop automation functionality is also under discussion; this is a Distribution-System Automation-scheme that restores the supply to the fault-free sections of a network, if they have been disconnected, because of a fault in another section of the network. Loop automation can also restore the normal network configuration automatically, when the faulty section is repaired. The process of isolating the faulty section and re-configuring the network to restore supply back to the fault-free sections is the first capability of Loop Automation. This research investigation assesses two different scenarios, namely: A conventional implementation of auto-reclosers on MV networks using Eskom reliability standard; and (ii.) the findings of a case-study using this recloser implementation (loop automation) to improve the reliability and the system’s performance.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{effectiveness}} of a phase overcurrent protection philosophy has been assessed by only considering a fault level versus protection operating time graph (only selectivity). In this research, an improved method was created to evaluate different phase overcurrent protection philosophies for medium-voltage feeders. A focus was placed on reliability, sensitivity, selectivity, speed of operation, performance and minimising risk. The hypothesis stated {{that it is possible to}} develop a method that allows for the evaluation of {{the effectiveness}} of phase overcurrent protection. To test this hypothesis, an application was created that allows for the analysis of an overcurrent protection philosophy. This application made provision for changes in source impedance, evaluation of protection backup contingencies, different conductor types, user-definable protection equipment, the placement of protection equipment, user-definable protection settings, primary plant equipment damage information, user-definable safety margins and source transformer protection information. The application provides graphs that allow the user to evaluate the protection philosophy in terms of the following criteria:  The protection operating time at specific positions in the network. The PU sensitivity of the feeder-installed protection equipment.  The PU sensitivity of the source transformer protection (backup function).  The let-through energy and associated equipment damage criteria.  The energy-area over the analysed path.  To classify the busbar voltage dip.  To determine the position of the fault on the analysed path for the associated busbar voltage dip.  To quantify the occurrence of a specific voltage dip category on the analysed path. The graphs that were generated by the application allowed for the analysis and optimisation of the applied protection settings. This optimisation includes determining operating time, operating curve selection and the number of <b>auto-reclose</b> attempts. It is possible to determine the preferred protection philosophy using the application. The application does not prescribe how settings are to be calculated, or the placement of the devices; it evaluates if the applied philosophy is protecting the feeder and how well it is protecting it.

30|$|The {{performance}} of the proposed strategy is evaluated in the VSC-based DC grid electromagnetic transient model under typical faults including pole-to-ground and pole-to-pole short-circuit faults. These two typical faults are set in the middle position of OHL 34 at t[*]=[*] 2  s. About 3  ms later, HHB 34 and HHB 43 receive protection-action orders from their local line-protection systems and perform their breaking operations. At about t[*]=[*] 2.006  s, the fault current begins to decrease from the peak value to zero in 10 – 20  ms. It {{should be noted that}} there is no MMC blocking in this procedure. After the predetermined deionization period of 300  ms, HHB 34 starts its sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> operation. If this is successful, then HHB 43 implements its sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> operation, referring to the sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategies of the AC circuit breaker. The simulation results based on these two kinds of sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategies under the typical faults are analyzed.|$|E
30|$|Using the {{proposed}} strategy, {{it is obvious}} that the DC voltage source −u 0 is gradually connected to the DC system in series at time intervals between t 0 and tn- 1 under a temporary fault.

Section  2 describes the overall protection-operation sequence for the DC line and the sequential operation sequence of the HHB, and analyzes the energy dissipated by the metal oxide varistor (MOV) in each unit. In Section  3, based on the traditional sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy, the novel sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy is proposed. Theoretical analysis of the two strategies is discussed in Section  4. The PSCAD/EMTDC simulation verification is performed in Section  5. Section  6 makes concluding remarks.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{concluded}} from the additional state shown in Fig.  5 d {{that the larger}} DC voltage source −u 0 suddenly connected to the DC system in series at t 0 {{will result in a}} larger du/dt under a temporary fault, which will negatively influence the whole VSC-based DC grid. Specifically, the larger du/dt may cause erroneous protection. Moreover, the resultant voltage oscillation may cause line-insulation failure and even damage to power electronic devices. To eliminate these potential adverse impacts, it is necessary to redesign the sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy and propose an optimal sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy.|$|E

The literature survey shows that no research work has been carried out to investigate a fault identification and phase selection algorithm suitable to be used in a novel single-phase <b>auto-reclosing</b> (SPAR) scheme, specifically suitable to distribution networks with DGs, for maintaining the continued operation of DGs during fault conditions. The work in this PhD has focused on investigating feeder protection requirements for continued operation of DGs in radial and ring overhead distribution networks with DGs, particularly the new requirements for operating an <b>auto-reclosing</b> scheme in networks with DGs. Simulation results obtained from this investigation have revealed that it is a possible to maintain continued operation of DGs that are based on DFIG and FSIG during temporary SLG faults in radial and ring operated networks.

In Fig.  14 b, an obvious current oscillation occurs in the same HHB 34 branch currents with the traditional strategy, while {{there is almost no}} current oscillation with the proposed strategy. As shown in Fig.  14 c, a large voltage oscillation, with a maximum value up to about 1.55 p.u. of the rated DC voltage, occurs in the fault line with the traditional strategy, yet there is almost no voltage oscillation with the proposed strategy. In Fig.  14 d, the current waveforms of the fault line with the corresponding <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy are the same as in Fig.  14 e because the HHBs are connected with the DC lines in series.

In Fig.  16 a, a larger oscillation in the port-voltage of HHB 34 at the positive-pole line is observed after the voltage decreases to zero vertically with the traditional strategy, while with the proposed strategy, a smaller voltage oscillation is discovered due to the voltage caused by the triggered MOVs that have not been bypassed. In Fig.  16 b, the fault current flowing through the same HHB 34 is detected somewhat earlier with the traditional strategy. The current occurring in the reclosing procedure is much smaller than the peak current in the breaking procedure.

In Fig.  16 d, the current waveforms of the fault line with the corresponding <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy are the same as those in Fig.  16 b, again because the HHBs are connected with DC lines in series.

30|$|Synchronous {{operation}} of the transfer branch in a hybrid HVDC breaker (HHB) [36] has been proposed to reduce the adverse effects on the VSC-based DC grid from a DCB reclosing operation under a permanent fault [37]. Specifically, all fully-controlled fast-power electronic switches in the transfer branch are energized {{to carry out the}} reclosing operation synchronously. Then the main branch is conducted if no fault is detected. Conversely, once a permanent fault is detected, all the fully-controlled fast-power electronic switches in the transfer branch will be immediately de-energized synchronously to interrupt the fault current. We call this the traditional sequential <b>auto-reclosing</b> strategy in this paper, and with its help, the fault current can be interrupted immediately if a permanent fault is detected. However, potential negative impacts such as erroneous protection, line-insulation failure, and even damage to power electronic devices will occur when the fault is temporary.|$|E

Power system protection {{concerns the}} detection of faults in the system from measured voltages and currents. However, non-fault voltage and current disturbances {{may lead to the}} inadvertent detection of a fault {{in the same way as}} voltage disturbances may lead to the tripping of end-user equipment. Starting from the principles (algorithms) of the relays, a quantification approach is developed to assess the isturbance impact on the relays. The quantification is based on the relay response after processing the disturbance signals by relay filters. This makes it possible to quantify the disturbance impact by the consequences caused by the disturbances, other than by the signal waveforms of the disturbances. Power transmission lines protection is one of the most important concerns for power utilities. Different types of faults occur on Transmission Line. From the transient phenomena, faults on transmission lines need to be detected, classified, located accurately, and cleared as fast as possible. Identification and classification of faults on transmission line are essential for relaying decision and <b>auto-reclosing</b> requirements. This dissertation presents a novel Wavelet-Fuzzy combined approach for digital relaying. An algorithm based on wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is used for classification of transmission faults for quick restoration of power supply and for improving the transient stabilit...|$|E
