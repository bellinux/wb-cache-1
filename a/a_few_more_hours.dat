5|$|In Mauritius, a {{total of}} 200people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters due to the cyclone. The island was under a Cyclone Warning Class III for 36hours, and for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> it was under a Cyclone Warning Class IV, the latter meaning wind gusts of 120km/h (75mph) were reported or expected. Prior to the storm affecting the area, officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban. Due {{to the threat of}} the storm, several flights in and out of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were canceled. Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the newly upgraded Erick tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico. A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July5, with tight banding noted on satellite. In addition, microwave imagery indicated the formative stages of an eyewall. Initially vertically decoupled, the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours. A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite, and Erick was upgraded to Category1 hurricane status at 0600UTC, located approximately 105mi (170km) west-southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983mb (hPa; 29.03inHg) at 1200UTC. Shortly thereafter, its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend. At 1800UTC on July7, Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated. Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July9 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur, leading to degeneration into a remnant low-pressure area at 0600UTC. The remnant vortex persisted for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours,</b> before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10.|$|E
25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours,</b> {{the strikers}} {{attempted}} {{to burn the}} barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|E

Christopher Livingston (PC Gamer) thought that [...] "attacking settlements, especially your own, is good fun, but there's hours of chores to complete {{before you can}} really become a raider." [...] Bob Fekete (iDigitalTimes) believed {{exploring the}} map of Nuka-World {{is some of the}} best gameplay in Fallout 4. Davide Ambrosiani (IGN) said Fallout 4s last expansion pack added some interesting mechanics and expands the world further. Juan Garcia (IGN) wrote about how he believed the expansion added a [...] "great new location" [...] which added <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> of gameplay, although it was more limited and repetitive than he wanted. Andrew Webster (The Verge) enjoyed exploring the map and discovering every detail of Fallouts world. He regarded it as a [...] "superb piece of worldbuilding." ...|$|E

I would not hesitate to claim that if one Spray was wrecked on a lee shore it was because her crew needed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> of sailing lessons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people have}} a {{temporary}} drop in alertness in the early afternoon, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "post-lunch dip." [...] While a large meal can make a person feel sleepy, the post-lunch dip is mostly an effect of the circadian clock. People naturally feel most sleepy at two times of the day about 12 hours apart—for example, at 2:00a.m. and 2:00p.m. At those two times, the body clock [...] "kicks in." [...] At about 2 p.m. (14:00), it overrides the homeostatic buildup of sleep debt, allowing several more hours of wakefulness. At about 2 a.m. (02:00), with the daily sleep debt paid off, it [...] "kicks in" [...] again to ensure <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> of sleep.|$|E

2500|$|He {{said that}} {{on the morning of}} 9 October, he took a scented bath and that soon after, Yahweh Elohim (an extraterrestrial) {{presented}} Claude Vorilhon to a machine which maximized his faculties. Yahweh Elohim then gave advice to him, the one who has become Claude Raël. [...] Claude Raël then spent <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> on the planet, doing Yoga and being given a long guided meditation session, and enjoyed what that world had to offer while he was there, including meeting with the past messengers of the Elohim. [...] By midnight of 10 October (Julian Date 2442695), 666 days after the first meeting with the Elohim and minutes after the last one, Claude Raël is back on Roc Plat. [...] His entire experience has taken exactly 72 hours.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be {{replaced}} by a new governor, General Baldissera, [...] met with his brigadiers Matteo Albertone, Giuseppe Arimondi, Vittorio Dabormida, and Giuseppe Ellena, concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note, [...] revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as Asmara. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale. Dabormida exclaiming, [...] "Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat." [...] Baratieri delayed making a decision for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours,</b> claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00. His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the storm}} was moving through southeastern Virginia, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) [...] issued a tornado watch for areas around Delaware Bay on September 28. The threat for tornadoes was {{possible}} as the moist air mass brought northward from the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne encountered cooler air in a region with high-level wind shear. The combination of these factors produced conditions favoring the development of tornadic thunderstorms. Several hours later, a second tornado watch was issued for areas along the northern shore of Delaware Bay through southern New Jersey. Flood watches were also extended northward into Massachusetts as Jeanne continued moving through the eastern United States. Several hours after Jeanne moved just offshore of the southern New Jersey coastline on September29, the National Weather Service discontinued all flood and flash flood watches associated with the storm; however, one county in New Jersey remained under a flood warning for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

60|$|However, {{while holding}} death at bay for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>more</b> or less {{we might as}} well have our faces turned in the right direction, and I was ready to do {{whatsoever}} the scout suggested, for, as I have said, fear had fled from me now that our position was so desperate.|$|R
60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>more,</b> Kascambo was {{in safety}} among his brother officers.

He was even then scarcely twenty years old, and peculiarly quiet and soft in manners.|$|R
2500|$|Jeanne-Claude was a {{firm believer}} in the {{aesthetic}} beauty of works of art; she said, “‘We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we believe it will be beautiful.’” However, {{that does not mean that}} Jeanne-Claude and Christo’s artworks were without larger political connotations. Jeanne-Claude and Christo created a piece in response to the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1962. They blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a wall of oil drums. The 4-meter-high wall built with oil barrels completely closed the street and blocked all communication between Rue Bonaparte and Rue de Seine. They said, [...] "This 'iron curtain' can be used as a barricade during a period of public work in the street, or to transform the street into a dead end. Finally its principle can be extended to a whole area or an entire city." [...] As the police approached, Jeanne-Claude firmly stood her ground and guarded the art piece, arguing for it to stay in place just for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

60|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>more</b> and {{the poor}} duckling's life had been ended.

He had on thick wooden shoes, and he went and stamped so hard on the ice that it broke, and then he picked up the duckling and tucked him under his sheepskin coat, where his frozen bones began to thaw a little.|$|R
60|$|The baronet, himself, {{appeared}} to be perfectly conscious of his situation; as was apparent by the anxiety he expressed to get his friends together, and more especially the concern he felt to make a due disposition of his worldly affairs.

6000|$|They alighted {{from the}} train in the chilly midnight air, and found {{their way through the}} crowd to the eating-room of the station.

Squire Gaylord stalked beside them with a demoniac vigor. [...] "A few more hours, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours,</b> sir!" [...] he said. He made a hearty supper, while the rest scalded their mouths with hot tea, which they forced with loathing to their lips.|$|E
60|$|He {{will then}} travel {{for a few}} hours to the German frontier. There he will be bundled out again. The French will {{investigate}} him closely to see that he is not carrying gold or large sums of money out of France. Then he will be handed over to the Germans. He will go through the same business with the customs and the same business with the money. His French money is no further use to him and he must get German. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> and he will arrive on the frontier of Bohemia. Same search for gold. Then customs' examination and change of money again. A few hours more and he will be in Poland. Search for gold, customs, fresh money.|$|E
6000|$|And the man promised, {{and went}} his way, till {{he came to}} a spring of water. And he drank a great draught and then lay on the bank and slept quietly.

So I will do her bidding, and seek out her native town and the man for whom the message was given.' ...|$|R

25|$|Soon de Leyva {{realized}} {{the attack was}} producing far more harm to his galleys and frigates and hardly any on the English.

Most of them had sustained some form of damage and some were fighting to stay afloat, while the English edging away from the coast still in convoy formation, headed West.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{had been}} looking about him during the long exhortation of the Moolah, and he had {{observed}} that the Dervishes were cleaning their guns, counting their cartridges, and making all the preparations of men who expected that they might soon {{be called upon to}} fight. The two Emirs were conferring together with grave faces, and the leader of the patrol pointed, as he spoke to them, in the direction of Egypt. It was evident that there was at least a chance of a rescue if they could only keep things going for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours.</b> The camels were not recovered yet from their long march, and the pursuers, if they were indeed close behind, were almost certain to overtake them.|$|E

60|$|Howard came up at noon {{with his}} division, and until sunset {{the fire was}} maintained, by which time almost the last {{cartridge}} was spent, and the crews worn our by their incessant labour.

Had the English ammunition lasted but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> the whole of the Armada would have been either driven ashore or sunk; but when the last cartridge had been burned the assailants drew off to take on board the stores which had, while the fighting was going on, been brought up by some provision ships from the Thames.|$|E
