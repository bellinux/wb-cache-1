5|$|Bunnell drafted {{an article}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> but {{destroyed}} it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his 1,500-foot (460m) height estimate for the valley's walls in half; {{the walls are}} in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised. The first published account of Yosemite Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854, issue of the Mariposa Chronicle, establishing the modern spelling of Yosemite. Bunnell described his awestruck impressions of the valley in his book, The Discovery of the Yosemite, published in 1892.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E

25|$|He died at {{the mission}} on 3 September 1870. While in Warrnambool in 1867, Dick-a-Dick was {{introduced}} to Christianity by Lawrence and appeared strongly affected by the life of Jesus. He was not worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to England as he knew the captain had prayed for a safe arrival. Just before his death, he confessed his faith in Christianity and was baptised on 30 July 1870. Minutes before his death, Dick-a-Dick claimed to have seen the face of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|In August 1989, Ethel meets a {{new love}} {{interest}} named Reggie Thompson (John Rutland). He invites {{her to go}} on a coach trip to Clacton for a dancing competition. Ethel is so excited that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Doré) find out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'. In 1992, Ethel's adored pug Willy succumbs to old-age and she has to make the heart-breaking decision to put him down. Regulars at The Queen Victoria pub raise money to buy Ethel a new dog, but she refuses to accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable. By the mid 1990s Ethel is seen much less frequently. She is seen occasionally however, usually when a big event is occurring or to celebrate Christmas and New Year with her old friends on the Square. After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing.|$|E

Until 1910 he was an editor of the journal. During this period he climbed many of the peaks in the Pannonian Basin. He was an active climber in the Southern Carpathians, in the Alps and also in the Făgăraș Mountains. He usually wrote notes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> which were also published along with his amateur panoramic photos.|$|R

500|$|... "Booze Cruise" [...] {{was written}} by Greg Daniels, making it his fourth writing credit, and his second season two credit, after [...] "Halloween" [...] earlier in the year. The episode was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis, making it his sixth directing credit for the series. Greg Daniels referred to this episode as [...] "our Scranton version of James Cameron's Titanic." [...] The idea came from B. J. Novak because {{a friend of his}} went on a booze cruise. Novak told Daniels <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> and Daniels then proceeded to write an episode about it.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Carver, a {{shoemaker}} from Massachusetts, {{visited the}} area in 1767 as part of another expedition. [...] He {{and the rest of}} the exploration party were only able to stay for a relatively short period, due to supply shortages. [...] They headed back east to Fort Michilimackinac, where Carver wrote journals <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> though others would later claim the stories were largely plagiarized from others. [...] The stories were published in 1778, but Carver died before the book earned him much money. [...] Carver County and Carver's Cave are named for him.|$|E
500|$|When Stewie and Brian return home, Lois asks Stewie <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> and Stewie covers up for Brian {{by saying}} the trip was [...] "Smooth sailing through calm seas". Lois leaves and Brian tells Stewie that he is thankful to Stewie for {{covering}} for him, and asks Stewie if there's anything he can do to repay him. At first, it appears that Stewie wishes to make him his servant by providing an example with an episode of The Brady Bunch, although {{it turns out that}} Stewie wants Brian to tape that episode for him.|$|E

500|$|After {{his mission}} in Iran in 1957–1958, Juskalian visited Kharpert, his father's birthplace. In an article he later wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> {{entitled}} [...] "Harput Revisited", {{which appeared in}} the April 1959 issue of the Armenian Review, Juskalian wrote: [...] "I tried in vain to locate my parents' home. Mezireh, as a community, was alive and well. Harput (Kharpert), on the other hand was dead, a bleak landscape of debris where once proudly stood a college, schools, churches, shops and homes. There was not even a grave over which to weep and pray for the souls of those from whom I came." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to one of}} these incidents, a friend of Lead Belly's, variously identified as either Lomax or Mary Elizabeth Barnicle joked that Washington was a [...] "bourgeois town." [...] Though Lead Belly did not know what the word [...] "bourgeois" [...] meant, he was fascinated by the sound of it, and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b> The song came together quickly; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead Belly to write it. Lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to her sister {{and when she got}} to the afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E

50|$|Unprocessed events queued {{up after}} the alarm system failure and the primary server failed within 30 minutes. Then all {{applications}} (including the stalled alarm system) were automatically transferred to the backup server, which itself failed at 14:54. The server failures slowed the screen refresh rate of the operators' computer consoles from 1-3 seconds to 59 seconds per screen. The lack of alarms led operators to dismiss a call from American Electric Power <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>tripping</b> and reclosure of a 345 kV shared line in northeast Ohio. But by 15:42, after the control room itself lost power, control room operators informed technical support (who were already troubleshooting the issue) of the alarm system problem.|$|R
500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Booze Cruise" [...] was {{inspired}} by a friend of B. J. Novak's who had gone on a booze cruise. Novak told Daniels <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> and Daniels then proceeded to write an episode about it. The episode featured the third and final appearance of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. The filming of the episode was a departure from the norm of the series; filming took place on an actual boat and because of this, many cast members got sea sick. [...] "Booze Cruise" [...] received largely positive reviews from critics. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 4.5 in the 18–49 demographic and was viewed by 8.7 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{travelled}} to Great Britain in 1845 {{for a third}} fundraising tour, giving {{speeches and}} sermons. [...] Wherever he travelled, Jones drew huge crowds, but inwardly he was depressed. [...] He felt the crowds were only there to see the exotic Indian Kahkewāquonāby and his native costume, and did not appreciate all the work he had put into becoming a good Christian. [...] Despite his misgivings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> he raised £1000, about two thirds of that total in Scotland, and one third in England. On August 4, 1845 in Edinburgh Jones was photographed by Robert Adamson and David Octavius Hill. [...] These were the first photographs taken of a North American Indian.|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} settled or uncontested <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> {{agreement}} and <b>the</b> global governance {{of intellectual property}} rights (iprs). This suggests that the provision of training and technical assistance to build capacity is itself part of the reproduction of <b>the</b> dominant (<b>trips</b> constituted) view of iprs and is therefore a political project rather than merely technical provision. On one side many developing countries' elites and governments are keen to join the international trading community and see the need to adopt the increasingly universalised rules of the system {{as part of this}} process. On the other hand, there are vocal constituencies less supportive of an unqualified adoption of trips‐related standards of legal protection for iprs. Given the continuing importance of legal structures to underpin and constitute markets (and this is most especially the case in markets for knowledge and information), the processes by which <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> solution to <b>the</b> question of knowledge ownership is being globalised through technical training needs to be understood and analysed...|$|R

500|$|Although most of {{the reviews}} were positive, some film experts were {{critical}} about the film. Amaresh Datta, in his book The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, criticised the film for [...] "following the neo-realistic style" [...] and showcasing [...] "same old love story without any freshness added". Poet and journalist C. P. Surendran called the film [...] "disturbing" [...] {{in one of his}} articles, criticising Gopalakrishnan and his films. Shyam Benegal, a film director and a well-known admirer of Gopalakrishnan's films, also mentioned that he was not particularly pleased with Swayamvaram. Some critics have pointed out its resemblance to Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha (1965). Gopalakrishnan agreed on influences of Ghatak and Satyajit Ray but pointed that Swayamvarams treatment is different from Ghatak's Subarnarekha as Swayamvaram is more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b>|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{recommended}} {{his friend}} George Harrison {{to be the}} lead guitarist. Lennon thought that Harrison—then 14 years old—was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played Raunchy for Lennon and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became [...] "The Beatles" [...] in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany and were desperately {{in need of a}} drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them. Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when he told her <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug, as well as amphetamines, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.|$|E
500|$|On Tuesday 27 February 2007, Saprang led a 13-member {{delegation}} to Europe, {{on what was}} {{claimed to be a}} week-long trip to study safety and security measures at major European airports. [...] Many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname, and the trip, which cost 7.2 million baht was attacked for [...] "squandering" [...] state funds for personal pleasure, disbursing unrealistic expenses, and inflating costs. [...] The travel agent along received a 500,000 baht commission fee for booking the trip. [...] Saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign. [...] He also noted that [...] "If you knew my character, you would know that even if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard." [...] He also noted that instead of being a viewed as a defendant, he should be viewed as a hero for bringing down the Thaksin government. [...] Saprang then summoned the leader of the AoT labor union in order to identify who leaked information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to his accusers.|$|E
