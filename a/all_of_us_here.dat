25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

She gave insight into the [...] "heart" [...] of the story. [...] "It was so successful," [...] she said. [...] "We did not tell a story about a lesbian. We told a story about a young girl coming out and her life around it. That was a big lesson to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> It's really all about the story. If you can make people care on a human level, it's not sexual preference. It's about the human experience." ...|$|E

Speeches were given by his friends, {{and one on}} behalf of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Those who could not get into the church due to overcrowding stood in the street with candles. Morley's friend said, [...] "This is the second time he was {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time, but for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts."

2500|$|While President Obama {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the decision, stating [...] "I think <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in the United States were surprised, disappointed and angry about the release", the U.S. government was aware that a release was possible. The deputy head of the U.S. embassy in London, Frank LeBaron, {{wrote in a letter}} to the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond that the U.S. believed al-Megrahi should remain in prison for his role in downing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988, and continued: [...] "Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose." [...] This same letter stressed the importance to the United States of America of a 3-months prognosis, despite it not being a legal requirement in Scotland: [...] "any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months".|$|E

This was the opinion of the majority, although a few sided with the captain, being induced to do so by the fact that he offered to give up all his share of the booty, if they would do so.|$|E

It is by the application {{of the power of the}} purse, and by the application of the power of the purse almost alone, that we have moved forward, slowly and prosaically, no doubt, during the last two hundred years, but without any violent overturn such as has rent the life and history of almost every other considerable country, from a kind of mediæval oligarchy to a vast modern democratic State based on the suffrages of six million or seven million electors, loyal to the Crown, and clothed with all the stately forms of the venerable English monarchy. Finance has been the keystone.

2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the enemy's retreat, the Wei general Zhuge Dan ordered his subordinate Jiang Ban (蔣班) to lead 4,000 troops to pursue and attack Liu Zan. As Liu Zan was ill at the time, {{he could not get}} up and direct the troops to fight the enemy. Knowing that they would lose the battle, he passed his ceremonial umbrella and his official seal to his subordinate(s) and told him, [...] "As a commander, I have defeated enemies and captured their flags, but I have never lost a single battle. Now, I am sick and outnumbered by the enemy. You should quickly leave while you still can. It won't do our State any good if <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> die <b>here</b> today; it'll only benefit the enemy."

Frankly, this man as an open enemy today could bring more harm upon us than if any neutral Power you could name were to join the Triple Alliance. Remember, too, Major Thomson, that there may be advantages to us in this waiting attitude. Since your warning, his letters can be admitted to censorship. You have the control of a great staff of military detectives; the resources of Scotland Yard, too, are at your service. Have him watched day and night, his letters opened, his every movement followed, but don't provoke him to open enmity. We don't want him in the Tower. The scandal and the shock of it would do us enormous harm, apart from the terrible financial panic which would ensue. We will see to it that he does no further mischief than he may already have done. We make an appeal to you, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> to-night. Be guided entirely by us in this matter. You have rendered the country great service by your discovery.

The former is golden and the latter, amid these innumerable mountains and great forests and frequent lakes, a magnificence of crimson and orange, a mixture of flames and gems.

This man with his dark handsome face sealed with the stamp of intellect, his powerful-looking form (ill dressed, according to their standard) and his great and growing reputation, was a person with whom they had no sympathy, and who, they felt, had no sympathy with them.

60|$|I {{have seen}} your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening {{recruiting}} stations near your camps. An act of Congress authorizes this, giving {{the appointment of}} agents to the States, {{and not to the}} Executive Government. It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain or modify the law, in its execution, further than actual necessity may require. To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending at the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the field as you now cause me to fear. Many of the States were very anxious for it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions, they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which, unlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they go to.
