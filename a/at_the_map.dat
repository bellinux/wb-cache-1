Loweswater does not therefore represent any watershed between the fells on either side of its valley, as might be supposed from a quick glance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> A low ridge circuiting the western end of the lake joins Burnbank Fell to Low Fell and Fellbarrow, confirming them as the last outpost of the Western Fells.|$|E

2500|$|The imaged {{part of the}} Bach region covers about 1,570,000km2. Its surface {{consists}} of craters {{of a wide variety}} of sizes and morphologies, as well as plains units, fault scarps, and ridges. It includes three double-ring basins that range from 140 to 200km in diameter: Bach (after which the region is named), Cervantes, and Bernini. Another large crater, Pushkin, is 240km in diameter and occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> boundary at latitude 65° S., longitude 25° [...] Both Bach and Bernini display extensive fields of secondary craters. An unusual area between lat 69° and 80° S. and long 30° and 60° {{consists of}} young, relatively smooth plains marked by many flat-topped ridges unlike any seen in other areas of Mercury. Scarps similar to Discovery Rupes (in the Discovery quadrangle adjacent to the north) are relatively common throughout the Bach region. The most common terrain units in the region are the plains units, which display a wide range of small-crater densities.|$|E
2500|$|The Committee of Public Safety {{believed}} Léchelle combined [...] "audacity {{with the}} necessary talents to end the war". Unfortunately, {{he turned out to}} be worse than Rossignol who, though brave, was generally understood to be incompetent. When Léchelle arrived at headquarters at Montaigu, Kléber placed a map in front of him and explained the strategy of his predecessor Canclaux. Without bothering to glance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> Léchelle replied, [...] "On this terrain it is a question of display. One must march majestically and in mass". As Kléber quietly put away the map, the representative Antoine Merlin de Thionville declared that the government was appointing the most ignorant generals possible. After discussion, it was agreed that the Nantes and Mayence divisions would continue to march from the west toward Cholet where it would meet converging columns from Luçon and Les Sables d'Olonne in the south and from Bressuire in the east. After starting at La Châtaigneraie, Chalbos and François Joseph Westermann devastated the countryside as far as Bressuire where they were joined by columns from Saumur and Thouars, making a body of 20,000 soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, the Map {{is simply}} a blank piece of parchment; but when the user points his wand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Map</b> and says, [...] "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good", the message [...] "Messrs.

Saying, [...] "Mischief managed!" [...] while pointing one's wand on the parchment returns the map to its original blank state. The map displays the location of everyone within the castle and its grounds, and includes the location of secret passageways and {{instructions on how to}} access them. Several locations like the Room of Requirement and the Chamber of Secrets do not appear on the map, either as the Marauders did not have any knowledge of them, or, {{in the case of the}} former, they are not a fixed location. Furthermore, Animagus disguises, Polyjuice Potion, and Invisibility Cloaks cannot fool the map, as shown in Goblet of Fire when Barty Crouch, Jr., using a Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Moody, and in Prisoner of Azkaban when Peter Pettigrew, who is supposed to be dead [...] but as an Animagus has transformed into a rat, are both displayed on the map.|$|E
