His forces repeatedly defeated, {{but were}} not able to destroy, the forces of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949. In October Peng's forces, led directly by Wang Zhen, invaded Xinjiang. Most of Xinjiang's defenders surrendered peacefully, and were incorporated as a new unit in Peng's army, but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years. After the People's Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and <b>Administrative</b> <b>Commission</b> and Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of Xinjiang, with Wang Zhen as his deputy. This appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, an area of over five millionsquare kilometres (1.9million square miles) but under thirty million people. Peng's forces continued their gradual occupation of Xinjiang, which they completed in September 1951.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the Bangladesh civil service for further development. There is {{widespread}} recognition that administrative reform is a priority in many countries. There is a long history of <b>administrative</b> reform <b>commissions</b> in Bangladesh and almost every administration in Bangladesh has instituted <b>administrative</b> <b>commissions</b> since its independence. However, the work of these commissions often remains limited to keeping the basic structure unchanged. These commissions do not always delve deeper into the issues. Yet, the cumulative problems of poor administration have now become so apparent in Bangladesh that hardly anyone remains to be convinced that something of more fundamental nature needs to be done. Accordingly, this paper first briefly reviews global public administration trends, followed by a discussion of the structural dimensions of civil service in Bangladesh. After that, civil service reform in Bangladesh will be examined in three dimensions: past efforts, recent initiatives, and a new vision...|$|R
