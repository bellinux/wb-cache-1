5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>few</b> strongholds in the {{northeast}} remained unconquered and in Christian hands, the fall of Taormina marked the effective end of Byzantine Sicily, and the consolidation of Muslim control over the island. However, it did not signal the end of Arab–Byzantine warfare on and around the island.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>few</b> {{people come}} in contact with fermium, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual {{exposure}} limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 107 becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 105 Bq; for fermium-257, at 105 Bq and 4000 Bq respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>few</b> {{people come}} in contact with mendelevium, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual {{exposure}} limits for the most stable isotope. For mendelevium-258, the ingestion limit was set at 9×105 becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 6000 Bq.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Skopje had 26,056 firms {{but only}} 145 {{of them had}} a large size. The large {{majority}} of them are either small (12,017) or very small (13,625). A large share of the firms deal with trade of goods (9,758), 3,839 are specialised in business and real estate, and 2,849 are manufacturers. <b>Although</b> <b>few</b> in number, large firms account for 51% of the local production outside finance.|$|E
5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and <b>although</b> <b>few</b> have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, {{but then}} {{handed it over}} to a Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000. In 2002 the company claimed that an American woman {{underwent}} a standard cloning procedure {{that led to the}} birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). <b>Although</b> <b>few</b> believe the claim, it nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status.|$|E

50|$|Plant species {{growing in}} Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest {{typically}} number upwards of 70, <b>although</b> <b>fewer</b> species {{are found in}} the smaller surviving pockets, and some may not be visible above ground, awaiting climatic conditions favourable for seed germination.|$|R
5|$|We {{know the}} titles of several lost works because of a list in Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, 6.13.1-3. They include the Outlines, in eight books, and Against Judaizers. Others are known only from {{mentions}} in Clement's own writings, including On Marriage and On Prophecy, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> are attested by other writers {{and it is difficult}} to separate works which he intended to write from those which were actually completed.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and <b>although</b> <b>few</b> have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, <b>although</b> <b>fewer</b> {{opinions}} are satisfied, some communities sound a single series of Tashrat-Tashat-Tarat without trebling. This may also fulfill the required total of thirty blasts, if tekiah is counted as one note, shevarim three, and teruah nine.|$|R
50|$|Today's head of {{household}} staff in a great house lives {{in much the same}} manner, <b>although</b> <b>fewer</b> households can afford large retinues of servants with an elaborate hierarchy. In some countries {{this is due to the}} minimum wage.|$|R
30|$|OnabotulinumtoxinA is {{the only}} agent {{specifically}} approved {{for the prevention of}} chronic migraine (Silberstein et al. 2013). It is extremely well tolerated. A comparative trial versus topiramate in chronic migraine (Cady et al. 2011) showed similar results, <b>although</b> <b>fewer</b> adverse events were recorded in the onabotulinumtoxinA group.|$|R
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs, such as {{the poison}} dart frogs, are {{especially}} toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> species are toxic enough {{to be used for}} this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (Eleutherodactylus gaigei and Lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection. Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, {{such as the}} Australian corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree and Pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves. The chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.|$|E
5|$|The AIF relinquished {{control over}} the men and {{responsibility}} for them while {{they were part of}} the NRRF, but undertook to repatriate them to Australia after they returned from Russia. Their motivations for joining were diverse, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> seemed have been political. Some had arrived in Britain as reinforcements too late to see any fighting during the war, and wanted to experience active service before returning to Australia. Others were decorated veterans and may have been motivated by a desire to see Russia, whilst some may have been unable to settle down after their wartime experiences, and could have viewed service as a means of postponing their return to civilian life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>fewer</b> than 100 {{cases are}} {{documented}} in English language literature, pseudoporphyria {{is most likely}} underreported in the literature because {{it is only a}} symptom of some other affliction, e.g. side effect of medicine or symptom of liver problems.As the symptoms of pseudoporhphyra have other names, those symptoms are mentioned.|$|R
5000|$|After {{his success}} as a used car {{salesman}} and with Kaiser-Frazer dealerships in Los Angeles and New York City, Muntz founded the Muntz Car Company, which made the [...] "Muntz Jet", a sports car with jet-like contours. The car was manufactured between 1951 and 1953, <b>although</b> <b>fewer</b> than 400 were produced.|$|R
25|$|The most {{significant}} population of trojans are the Jupiter trojans. <b>Although</b> <b>fewer</b> Jupiter trojans {{have been discovered}} as of 2010, {{it is thought that}} they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt. Trojans have been found in the orbits of other planets, including Venus, Earth, Mars, Uranus, and Neptune.|$|R
5|$|The genetic {{sequence}} information from A.bisporigera {{has been used}} to identify molecular polymorphisms in the related A.phalloides. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be used as population genetic markers to study phylogeography and population genetics. Sequence information has also been employed to show that A.bisporigera lacks many of the major classes of secreted enzymes that break down the complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls, like cellulose. In contrast, saprobic fungi like Coprinopsis cinerea and Galerina marginata, which break down organic matter to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. <b>Although</b> <b>few</b> ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|Upon ML Pin's {{return from}} Europe in 1931, Public Instruction Minister Prince Dhani Nivat {{appointed}} {{him as a}} government official under Krom Vichakan, a department of the ministry. He also served the Prince in a somewhat unofficial capacity, assisting the Prince's work and observing the ministry's various goings-on. Under the Prince's directions, ML Pin became an instructor in mathematics, Thai, and English at Chulalongkorn University, {{in addition to the}} various duties he performed for the ministry. In 1934, he became head of the university's teacher-preparation programme and headmaster of the Horwang Secondary School of Chulalongkorn University, which served as the country's first demonstration (teacher training) school. He began developing projects for the school, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> of them were realised at the time. One such project was the creation of the country's first school workshop.|$|E
5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E
25|$|Intra-Palestinian {{violence}} {{was also a}} prominent feature of the Intifada, with widespread executions of an estimated 822 Palestinians killed as alleged Israeli collaborators, (1988–April 1994). At the time Israel reportedly obtained information from some 18,000 Palestinians who had been compromised, <b>although</b> <b>fewer</b> than half had any proven contact with the Israeli authorities.|$|R
50|$|In 1878, John Moses Browning {{patented}} {{arguably the}} greatest single-shot rifle ever produced: after Browning sold his design to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company {{it was brought}} out as the Winchester Model 1885 Rifle. <b>Although</b> <b>fewer</b> than 200,000 Model 1885 Single Shots were built, it remained in production from 1885 to 1920.|$|R

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife indicate that arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, beginning in the seventh century BCE, as elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced. Some of these forts in southern Scotland are associated with cultivation ridges and terraces. Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and <b>although</b> <b>few</b> have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products. Aerial photography reveals extensive prehistoric field systems that underlie existing boundaries in some Lowland areas, suggesting that the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of what is now northern England, and occasional advances into Southern Scotland, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for five centuries, suggesting that the Roman invasions had a negative impact on the native population and the extent of agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver {{supplies}} and aid in {{search and rescue}} missions. On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E
5|$|King Henry {{continued}} {{to support the}} young duke, but in late 1046 opponents of William came together in a rebellion centred in lower Normandy, led by Guy of Burgundy with support from Nigel, Viscount of the Cotentin, and Ranulf, Viscount of the Bessin. According to stories that may have legendary elements, {{an attempt was made}} to seize William at Valognes, but he escaped under cover of darkness, seeking refuge with King Henry. In early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and were victorious at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes near Caen, <b>although</b> <b>few</b> details of the actual fighting are recorded. William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William's efforts, but earlier accounts claim that King Henry's men and leadership also played an important part. William assumed power in Normandy, and shortly after the battle promulgated the Truce of God throughout his duchy, in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted. Although the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes marked a turning point in William's control of the duchy, it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility. The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare, with lesser crises continuing until 1060.|$|E
