5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> {{she was an}} {{excellent}} student, but needed to quit school {{at the age of}} 11 to care for her ill grandmother. At 15, she taught school and a year later joined an academy in Providence, Rhode Island, where she earned her way through school by making and selling needlework. She graduated with highest honors and established a school that she operated for years. Paine gave the profits to her family, and she helped support them throughout most of her life.|$|E
5|$|Born to Cheryl and Doug McLeod in St. Albert, Alberta, a city near Edmonton, Erin {{was raised}} with her younger sister, Cara, and older sister, Megan. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> McLeod {{fell in love}} with hockey and the Edmonton Oilers. At the age of five, her family moved to Calgary, where she {{channelled}} her obsession into soccer. She quickly climbed the local soccer ranks and found herself a midfielder on a Calgary select team. At the age of 12, the goalkeeper on the team was injured and she stepped up for the spot. She has been a goalkeeper ever since.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelmina FitzClarence, Countess of Munster (née Kennedy-Erskine; 27 June 1830– 9 October 1906) was a British peeress and novelist. Her mother, Lady Augusta FitzClarence, was {{an illegitimate}} {{daughter}} of William IV of the United Kingdom; Wilhelmina, {{also known as}} Mina, was born the day after William's succession as monarch. She travelled <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> throughout Europe, visiting the courts of France and Hanover. In 1855, Mina married her first cousin William FitzClarence, 2nd Earl of Munster; they would have nine children, including the 3rd and 4th Earls of Munster.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix, who was of French origin, met {{the king}} in Paris <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> {{when she was}} only 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living as a prostitute. They soon {{embarked}} upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (“the Queen of Congo”).|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

5|$|Born Anna Louise Mohan, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> {{she began}} using {{the last name}} of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, instead of her father's name. She grew up in rural Nevada and {{attended}} the University of Nevada in Reno and the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating {{with a degree in}} history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During her years in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers outside of marriage, and during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) these included playwright Eugene O'Neill and painter Andrew Dasburg.|$|E

Below, in the street, a taxi passed with grinding of brakes and noisy horn. The rail against which she leaned looked very flimsy. Sir Timothy stretched out his hand and held her arm.|$|R
