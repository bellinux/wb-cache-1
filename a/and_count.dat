40|$|A precise, {{accurate}} and well documented method for the sizing <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> of microbubbles {{is essential for}} all aspects of quantitative microbubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging. The efficacy of (a) electro-impedance volumetric zone sensing (ES) also called a Coulter counter/multisizer; (b) optical microscopy (OM); and (c) laser diffraction (LD), for the sizing <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> of microbubbles was assessed.

Statistical analyses of intra-method variability for the SonoVue™ mean diameter showed that the best microbubble sizing reproducibility was obtained using OM with a mean diameter sizing variability of 1. 1 %, compared with a variability of 4. 3 % for ES and 7. 1 % for LD. The best microbubble counting reproducibility was obtained using ES with a number concentration variability of 8. 3 %, compared with a variability of 22. 4 % for OM and 32 % for LD.

While steaming in the English Channel on 31 May, König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of between 269 and 276 men. Her loss spurred a series of investigations into the circumstances of the collision, which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of both Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, <b>and</b> <b>Count</b> Alexander von Monts, the captain of Grosser Kurfürst. Political infighting over the affair led to ouster of Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner from the navy.|$|E
