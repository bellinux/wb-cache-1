25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} oxytocin {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the Oxytocin Challenge Test (OCT) fail.

It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent <b>atosiban</b> (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, salbutamol, and terbutaline).|$|E
50|$|In a {{systematic}} review of <b>atosiban</b> for tocolysis in preterm labour, six clinical studies — two compared <b>atosiban</b> to placebo and four <b>atosiban</b> to a β agonist — {{showed a significant}} increase in the proportion of women undelivered by 48 hours in women receiving <b>atosiban</b> compared to placebo. When compared with β agonists, <b>atosiban</b> increased the proportion of women undelivered by 48 hours and was safer compared to β agonists.

50|$|Multicentre, {{controlled}} {{trial of}} <b>atosiban</b> vs. ritodrine in 128 women shows a significantly better tocolytic efficacy after 7 {{days in the}} <b>atosiban</b> group than in the ritodrine group (60.3 versus 34.9%), but not at 48 hours (68.3 versus 58.7%). Maternal adverse events were reported less frequently in the <b>atosiban</b> group (7.9 vs 70.8%), resulting in fewer early drug terminations due to adverse events (0 versus 20%).

50|$|A {{clinical}} trial (Salim R et al., 2012) compared tocolytic efficacy and tolerability of <b>atosiban</b> {{with that of}} nifedipine.

50|$|<b>Atosiban</b> is a nonapeptide, desamino-oxytocin analogue, and a {{competitive}} vasopressin/oxytocin receptor antagonist (VOTra). <b>Atosiban</b> inhibits the oxytocin-mediated release of inositol trisphosphate from the myometrial cell membrane.

50|$|In human pre-term labour, <b>atosiban,</b> at the {{recommended}} dosage, antagonises uterine contractions and induces uterine quiescence.

At randomization, women were stratified by gestational age (≤ 28 weeks and > 28 weeks). <b>Atosiban</b> (i. v. bolus dose of 6. 75 mg, then 300 μg/min for 3 h and 100 μg/min for up to 48 h) and salbutamol (2. 5 – 45 μg/min) were administered by i. v. infusion for up to 48 h. Retreatment with study drug or an alternative tocolytic agent was allowed. Main outcome measures included tocolytic effectiveness which was assessed {{in terms of the number}} of women undelivered after 48 h and 7 days. Tocolytic efficacy and tolerability were assessed in terms of the proportion of women undelivered and who did not require alternative tocolytic therapy at 48 h and 7 days of starting treatment.

Results: Tocolytic effectiveness at 48 h was 93. 3 versus 95. 0 % (P= 0. 67) and after 7 days was 89. 9 versus 90. 1 % (P= 0. 93) in the <b>atosiban</b> and salbutamol groups, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Atosiban</b> is a {{selective}} oxytocin receptor antagonist capable of inhibiting oxytocin-induced contractility of the uterus. Trials of this agent in intact animals {{and women as}} a tocolytic agentfor preterm labor have shown <b>atosiban</b> to be devoid of cardiac effects. This {{is in contrast to}} other tocolytic agents, which have profound hemodynamic effects. We conducted this study to determine the cardiac effects of <b>atosiban</b> in the isolated, perfused rat heart model. METHODS: Hearts were excisedfrom 60 female Sprague-Dawley rats and attached to a Langendorff apparatus. Left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate, and contractility were measured. Heartsfrom haff of the animals were exposed serially to 300 pug/min, 600 pig/min, and 1200 pug/min of <b>atosiban.</b> The remaining hearts formed the control group and were exposed to aerated Krebs solution. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences between}} hearts exposed to <b>atosiban</b> and hearts within the control group for heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, and contractility. P values rangedfrom 12 to. 73.

Patients were randomized to receive either <b>atosiban</b> (n = 23) or ritodrine (n = 22). Tocolytic efficacy of the drug was assessed as the proportion of women who did not deliver and did not need alternative tocolytic treatment at 7 days after therapy initiation.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of tocolytics {{is central}} in delaying birth; however, {{therapeutic}} options vary in effectiveness and adverse events profiles, {{which in turn}} could have consequences for medical resource use and cost of treatment. Betamimetics are commonly used tocolytic agents, but their mechanism of action affects multiple organ systems leading to numerous adverse events. The availability of an oxytocin receptor antagonist, specific for prevention of preterm labour, offers a treatment option that merits further evaluation. We aimed to compare economic implications of tocolysis using <b>atosiban</b> and betamimetics, considering treatment efficacy and safety, as well as cost consequences of treatment of associated adverse events. Methods A systematic literature review identified six randomised clinical trials, three of them double-blinded, comparing <b>atosiban</b> with betamimetics, in which tocolysis was initiated within 48 hours of admission. Cost of drug treatment was calculated based on trial protocols and German hospital drug purchase costs. G-DRG Grouper was used to obtain cost per case. The drug regimen was concordant with the German guidelines {{for the management of}} preterm labour, with two alternative modalities of fenoterol analysed: continuous or bolus administrations. Results According to the results of the meta-analysis of the three double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials, <b>atosiban</b> and betamimetics have similar efficacy (RR = 0. 99, 95 %CI: 0. 94 – 1. 04, p = 0. 772). Compared to betamimetics, use of <b>atosiban</b> was associated with a significantly lower frequency of adverse events for tachycardia, palpitation, vomiting, headache, hyperglycaemia, tremor, dyspnoea, chest pain, hypocalemia and foetal tachycardia. In our economic analysis, cost savings from using <b>atosiban</b> versus continuous, or bolus, fenoterol was 423 € per patient from the payer's perspective. From the hospital's perspective, savings from using <b>atosiban</b> versus continuous fenoterol ranged from 259 € for 18 hours of tocolysis to 105 € for 48 hours; the respective values for bolus fenoterol were 244 € and 55 €. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis <b>atosiban</b> was cost saving versus both continuous and bolus fenoterol in 87 %– 100 % of scenarios. Conclusion In a German setting, <b>atosiban</b> is cost saving versus betamimetics in the treatment of preterm labour from the payer, hospital and combined perspectives.
