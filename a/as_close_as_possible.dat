5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (<b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible),</b> It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, {{this would not be}} guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps {{across the face of}} the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{requires}} {{each species}} {{to be represented}} by a type collection. The destruction of Burret's type collections left many species only known from his original descriptions, which generally lacked illustrations. Other specimens (called neotypes) were designated to replace these, either by Rodrigo Bernal and colleagues in 1989 or by Borchsenius and Bernal in their 1996 monograph of the genus.

In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, San José de Chiquitos, Concepción, San Miguel de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, these churches have undergone meticulous restoration. In the 1960s, the San Ignacio de Velasco church was replaced with modern construction; in the 1990s, Hans Roth and his co-workers brought the restoration <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to the original edifices. In addition to the churches, Roth constructed {{more than a hundred}} new buildings, including schools and houses. He also founded museums and archives.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's {{interest}} in baroque music {{was not limited}} to the Bach St Matthew Passion which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether for performance or for publication, to be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to the original intentions of the composers, including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel, or to add parts for trombones. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach's works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} in English law {{is an element}} of trusts law dealing with charitable trusts. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French cy près comme possible (<b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible),</b> but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine law.|$|E

5|$|The characters' {{body and}} facial {{movements}} were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided {{the basis for}} their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts. Something that both in-house and external staff contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to the center of a gray square target.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, {{and one of}} the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended to be part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E

5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct open market operations so that both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to their desired values.|$|E
