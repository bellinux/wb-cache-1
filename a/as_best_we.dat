25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few {{women and children who}} told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.|$|E
500|$|In September, the new five-piece b{{and began}} rehearsals in Notting Hill Gate {{and began to}} modify its sound. Banton, {{influenced}} by the effects pedals popularised by Jimi Hendrix, used his electronic skills to modify a Farfisa organ, giving it {{a wider variety of}} sounds. Jackson took his jazz influences, particularly Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and began to play multiple saxophones (usually alto and tenor) simultaneously. Hammill, for his part, elected to sing in received pronunciation, exploring the full range of his vocal capabilities. [...] "We were all megalomaniacs," [...] said Banton. [...] "We grabbed our own space <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could." [...] The band started to gig regularly, including the first of several live appearances at the Friars Aylesbury in November.|$|E

5000|$|The band cite Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly, plus metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Skid Row, Def Leppard, and Dokken, as influences. Discussing their anthem rock style, {{band member}} Alex Necochea said, [...] "We're really not heavy metal. I think {{our focus is}} more on writing great singles, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can make them. That's just {{something}} Bryn and I grew up on.

500|$|On May 7, 2013, Lambesis {{was arrested}} in Oceanside, California, US after {{allegedly}} hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report {{was made by the}} San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: [...] "The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can." [...] They also stated that their thoughts were [...] "with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation." [...] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that [...] "we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded [...] "not guilty" [...] and his lawyer stated: [...] "His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use." [...] On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from [...] "not guilty" [...] to [...] "guilty" [...] and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.|$|E

2500|$|The F8-VII was {{described}} by the team as a solid base on which to build, as they had {{a relatively short period}} of time to produce the new F1 car. James Key, the technical director of Spyker F1, said, [...] "We also tried to second guess <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could what the 2007 tyres were going to do, and we worked hard on aero, which is of course always the fundamental thing. That way we could concentrate all our efforts on performance related areas." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a radio {{interview}} with the Will Anderson Radio Show, Brooks stated his opposition to undocumented immigrants serving in the military, saying, [...] "These individuals have to be absolutely 100 percent loyal and trustworthy, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can make them, ‘cause they’re gonna have access {{to all sorts of}} military weaponry—even to the point of having access to weapons of mass destruction like our nuclear arsenal.

60|$|Then, a man {{having been}} {{transferred}} to my canoe, we once more started on in very low spirits and not feeling at all comfortable as to the future, but fondly hoping {{to arrive at the}} 'Highlands' station by night. To make matters worse, within an hour of sunrise it came on to rain in torrents, wetting us to the skin, and even necessitating the occasional baling of the canoes, and as the rain beat down the wind we could not use the sails, and had to get along <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could with our paddles.|$|R

Only a small remnant will remain. We must reconstruct <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can. We find buried silver in good quantities and plenty of grain, so that our people have plenty to eat and to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{a recent}} film like Robot Jox (1990) ... revels in {{exploring}} the technical complexities of its central conceit–nations warring vicariously through giant robots piloted by gladiator-type [...] "jockies"–it repeatedly emphasizes {{how much of}} the human has been surrendered to the technological and concludes with its chief antagonists abandoning their mechanical mounts to live in peace. Robot Jox, though, is just one of a great many such films to depict the attractions and promises of science and technology as essentially fictions, dangerous illusions from which we eventually have to pull back <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can if we are to retain our humanity.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Obama's {{speech on}} Tuesday was a {{brilliant}} effort to deflect attention away from what remains the core issue: what did Obama hear, when did he hear it, {{and what did he}} do about it? The answers, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can tell at this stage, is that Obama heard some very harsh things said from the pulpit of Trinity United Church of Christ; that Obama heard them said {{a long time ago and}} probably repeatedly; and that he did little or nothing about it. This from a man who tells us at almost every stop along the campaign trail that he has the [...] "judgment to lead." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept and}} {{development}} for Pirate Warriors began with a meeting between Tecmo Koei producer Hisashi Koinuma and Namco Bandai producer Koji Nakajima. Nakajima read the One Piece manga and also played the Dynasty Warriors video games during his youth.

Koinuma said that the developers wanted to [...] "express the charm of author Eiichiro Oda's manga art <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can".

2500|$|After {{the murder}} of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, Johnson went on {{television}} to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klansmen implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a [...] "hooded society of bigots," [...] and warned them to [...] "return to a decent society before it's too late." [...] Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since Ulysses S. Grant about 93 years earlier. He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South. At the Howard University commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both {{the government and the}} nation needed to help achieve goals, [...] "To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice, but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin.

2500|$|... "Window Seat"'s {{official}} {{music video}} was premiered on March 27, 2010 at 3:33a.m. on Badu's website. Circulating throughout several Internet blogs, the music video was received with controversy and a divided reaction from fans, Internet critics, and media outlets. On March 30, 2010, {{it became the}} ninth most popular search on Google. The music video also prompted attention from Dallas city officials for Badu's public nudity and filming without city permits. Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway expressed concern for stricter laws to prevent similar incidents, stating [...] "None {{of this would have}} occurred had she stayed clothed. But since she didn't, it elevated the need for making sure that we have policies in place that will protect folks and the integrity of the city <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> possibly can ... What if there is another take to her bizarre activity? What if there is a part two and we don't take some type of action or put it up for discussion and she comes out and really gets with it and does a Michael Jackson-type video and have 15, 20 people and all of them take their clothes off?" ...|$|E

30|$|Some {{limitations}} though {{need to be}} recognised. This particularly {{applies to}} the labour data, where sometimes, the precise classification of occupations differs {{from one country to}} another (or over time within countries). In addition, while the question about labour force participation is the same everywhere, this is not a labour force survey and it remains possible that the interpretation of what “working” means might not have been consistently applied everywhere. These issues are important and need to be recognised. Here, we take care to analyse this data in a way to ensure consistency across countries and over time <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can. This means for example choosing not to use some questions or occupational categories where we cannot be confident of comparability.|$|R
