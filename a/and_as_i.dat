And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second. The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him.|$|E

25|$|Metalcore is {{a fusion}} genre that merges heavy {{hardcore}} punk with extreme metal. Metalcore has screaming, growling, heavy guitar riffs, breakdowns, and double bass drumming. Heavy metal-hardcore punk hybrids {{arose in the}} mid-1980s and would also radicalize the innovations of hardcore as the two genres and their ideologies intertwined noticeably, resulting in two main genres one being metalcore. The term {{has been used to}} refer to bands that were not purely hardcore nor purely metal such as Earth Crisis, Integrity and Hogan's Heroes. Metallica and Slayer, pioneers of the heavy metal subgenre thrash metal, were influenced by a number of hardcore bands. Metallica's cover album Garage Inc. included covers of two Discharge and three Misfits songs, while Slayer's cover album Undisputed Attitude consisted of covers of predominately hardcore punk bands. During the 2000s, many more metalcore bands became known. Bullet for My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, Shadows Fall, <b>and</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Lay Dying all had some popularity during the 2000s.|$|E

Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net described the album as [...] "a well-rounded and often thrashy metalcore album, as the band has struck an effective balance between aggression and accessible melodies." [...] Thom Jurek of Allmusic praised the band for expanding its musical range by including melodic singing and choruses, as they had previously done on [...] "Confined" [...] from Shadows Are Security.

500|$|Beyond {{his role}} in the Senate, Adams played a minor role in the {{politics}} of the early 1790s. During his two vice-presidential terms, Adams attended few cabinet meetings, and the president sought his counsel only infrequently. Nonetheless, the two men, according to Ferling, [...] "jointly executed many more of the executive branch's ceremonial undertakings than would be likely for a contemporary president and vice-president." [...] Overall, while Adams brought energy and dedication to the office, he found the task [...] "not quite adapted to my character...too inactive, and mechanical." [...] He often lamented what he viewed as the [...] "complete insignificance" [...] of his situation. To his wife Abigail he once wrote, [...] "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man [...] [...] [...] or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate." ...|$|E
