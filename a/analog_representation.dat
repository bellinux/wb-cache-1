If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens' law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes...|$|R

In particular, psychologists have documented a range of approximate numerical capacities that are possessed by human beings of various ages, 1 {{and in order to}} explain those capacities, many have posited a system of analog magnitudes, arguing that a digital system of representation could not account for the experimental data. 2 However, there are certain aspects of the analog-digital distinction that have gone largely unnoticed, and yet their clarification may affect the contours of debate. My aim, therefore, is to clarify those aspects of the distinction. In doing so, I argue for three claims. The first is that, while it is commonly held that <b>analog</b> <b>representations</b> are continuous and that digital representations are discrete, properly understood the distinction concerns the format and not the medium of representation.

Gibbs' claim that abstract concepts arise by metaphor from embodied reality is sometimes hard to distinguish from the traditional empiricist view. For the most part same evidence {{can be used to}} support both views. Gibbs admits that the metaphor, which forms an abstract concept, does not preserve all aspects of the original bodily experience; so abstraction from experience might be a better term. The real originality of the embodied metaphor view is the claim that something of the embodied nature of the original experience still operates whenever an abstract concept is used. Gibbs states that the original experience persists in a schematic form called an image schema. He defines image schemas as <b>analog</b> <b>representations</b> of spatial relations and movements in space. For example, Gibbs lists a number of bodily experiences of the form [...] "Some part of the body is too hot/cold/etc.": My head is too hot My hand is too cold My mouth feels too dry. He states that these are all instances of a single image schema, the balance schema. This image schema is claimed to be used in many kinds of abstract thought. For instance, in Hamlet's speech [...] "To be or not to be", Gibbs says that [...] "one quickly recognizes" [...] is an allusion to the balance schema because it involves making a difficult decision.|$|R
