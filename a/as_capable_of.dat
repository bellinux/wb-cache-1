5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

Five responded: a consortium led by Rockwell International of the United States, Plessey of the United Kingdom, Signaal of the Netherlands, Sintra Alcatel of France, and a collaboration between the German Krupp Atlas Elektronik and the British Ferranti. Each tender was required to offer a system with a distributed architecture, {{despite the absence of}} an accepted definition for 'distributed computing' at that time, and had to show the cost of programming the software in Ada, although they could offer additional cost breakdowns for other programming languages.|$|E

After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> leading a team to success, and he was seen as one of the league's premier players.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, {{numerous}} scholars {{think that}} tefillin also play an apotropaic function. For instance, Yehudah B. Cohn {{argues that the}} tefillin should be perceived as an invented tradition aimed at counteracting {{the popularity of the}} Greek amulets with an “original” Jewish one. In fact, some more anthropologically inclined scholars like Joshua Trachtenberg, considered every ornament worn on the body (whatever its declared function) as initially serving the purpose of an amulet. In addition to this the early Rabbinic sources furnish more or less explicit examples of the apotropaic qualities of tefillin. For instance, Bamidbar R. 12:3 presents tefillin <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> defeating “a thousand demons” emerging on “the left side,” rabbis Yohanan and Nahman used their sets to repel the fiends inhabiting privies in BT Berakhot 23a-b, whereas Elisha the Winged, who was scrupulous in performing this mitzvah, was miraculously saved from the Roman persecution in BT Shabbat 49a. Also, tefillin are believed to possess life-lengthening qualities, as suggested in BT Menahot 36b, 44a-b and in BT Shabbat 13a-b and they are often listed in one breath among various items which are considered amuletic in nature, {{as is the case in}} M Kelim 23:1, M Eruvin 10:1 or BT Eruvin 96b-97a.|$|E
5|$|Based at Nui Dat in the III Corps Tactical Zone {{as part of}} US II Field Force, Vietnam, 1 ATF {{included}} two infantry battalions plus armour, aviation, engineers and artillery support, with total Australian troop strength in Vietnam reaching 6,300 men. Logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group based {{at the port of}} Vung Tau. Meanwhile, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units operating in the province in early-1967 included Main Forces from the 5th Division, which consisted of the 274th and 275th Regiments, each of three infantry battalions under the command of Senior Colonel Nguyen The Truyen. Supporting this force were a number of artillery, engineer, medical and logistic units. Group 89 (Artillery) was equipped with recoilless rifles, medium mortars and heavy machine-guns. Local Forces included D445 Battalion, a provincial unit normally operating in the south of the province and in Long Khanh, while guerrilla forces {{included two}} companies in the Chau Duc district, one in Long Dat and a platoon in Xuyen Moc; in total around 4,500 men. Australian intelligence assessed the division <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> conducting a regimental-sized harassing raid against Nui Dat, {{while at the same time}} using its second regiment for ambushes, decoys or other supporting tasks. 274th Regiment was believed capable of inflicting heavy casualties on units up to a battalion, while 275th Regiment was assessed as only having the capability to attack isolated outposts or conduct limited ambushes and was unlikely to attempt a major attack without the support of 274th Regiment. Overall, it lacked the ability to conduct a protracted division-sized operation, although one regiment could likely reinforce the other within a period of eight hours. Yet even while the possibility of a divisional attack against Nui Dat was considered remote, the threat of raids up to regimental strength forced Graham to maintain a defensive posture. Yet lacking a third infantry battalion, 1 ATF's operational strength was limited. D445 Battalion was thought capable of mortaring, harassing fire and quick raids and was likely to be able to inflict heavy casualties on forces up to company size.|$|E

25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether {{we are concerned}} with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E

25|$|Several {{contrary}} {{claims have}} been made against that the flight capabilities of Confuciusornis. The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In Senter's {{of the position of}} the shoulder joint, a normal upstroke would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that {{due to the lack of}} a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the Musculus pectoralis minor could not serve as a M. supracoracoideus lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a foramen triosseum. This, coupled with a limited upstroke caused by a lateral position of the shoulder joint, would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors therefore proposed that Confuciusornis used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like a squirrel. Daniel Hembree however, while acknowledging that tree climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25° relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the antitrochanter in the hip joint. Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that Confuciusornis climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees Confuciusornis <b>as</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.|$|E
