25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{is caused}} by the dispersion of the lens material—the variation of its refractive index, n, with the wavelength of light. Since, from the formulae above, f is dependent upon n, it follows that light of different wavelengths is focused to different positions. Chromatic aberration of a lens is seen as fringes of colour around the image. It can be minimised by using an achromatic doublet (or achromat) in which two materials with differing dispersion are bonded together to form a single lens. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. The use of achromats was an important step {{in the development of the}} optical microscope. An <b>apochromat</b> is a lens or lens system with even better chromatic aberration correction, combined with improved spherical aberration correction. Apochromats are much more expensive than achromats.|$|E
2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or <b>apochromat.</b> Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

50|$|Abbe {{numbers are}} used in the design of {{achromatic}} lenses, as their reciprocal is proportional to dispersion (slope of refractive index versus wavelength) in the wavelength region where the human eye is most sensitive (see graph). For different wavelength regions, or for higher precision in characterizing a system's chromaticity (such as in the design of <b>apochromats),</b> the full dispersion relation (refractive index as a function of wavelength) is used.|$|R
5000|$|Doublets {{can come}} in many forms, though most {{commercial}} doublets are achromats, which are optimized to reduce chromatic aberration while also reducing spherical aberration and other optical aberrations. The lenses are made from glasses with different refractive indices and different amounts of dispersion. Often one element is made from crown glass and the other from flint glass. This combination produces a better image than a simple lens. Some Trilobites, which are now extinct, had natural doublet lenses in their eyes. [...] <b>Apochromats</b> can also be made as doublets.|$|R

We present an efficient approach to choose a couple of low-cost glasses to obtain a low aberration double prism. The doublet prisms were made of two lead-free glasses. The relative partial dispersion of the two lead-free glasses is identical and their Abbe numbers are different greatly. The proposed design aims to minimize chromatic aberration, such as in <b>apochromats,</b> for paraxial ray tracing.

40|$|The {{design of}} apochromatic systems is {{difficult}} because of two problems: the glass sorts compatibility and the c 1 /ca arbitrary input ratio. The optical glass manufacturers offer {{a wide range of}} sorts, so that the choice of triplet compatible glasses becomes itself an important separate problem. The paper provides a solution of mathematical modeling for the glass compatibility and, practically, analyses the sorts presented by Schott GmbH. The original software provided 22 compatible glass triplets. The authors explored the possibilities of enlarging the c 1 /ca ratio from the value 0. 6 indicated in the literature to a range of [0. 5 … 0. 8]. Therefore, they designed and analyzed a set of 88 triplets.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} information on how microscopes work and discusses some of the microscope issues {{to be considered in}} using a video camera on the microscope. There are two types of microscopes in use today for research in cell biology-the older finite tube-length (typically 160 mm mechanical tube length) microscopes and the infinity optics microscopes that are now produced. The objective lens forms a magnified, real image of the specimen at a specific distance from the objective known as the intermediate image plane. All objectives are designed to be used with the specimen at a defined distance from the front lens element of the objective (the working distance) so that the image formed is located at a specific location in the microscope. Infinity optics microscopes differ from the finite tube-length microscopes in that the objectives are designed to project the image of the specimen to infinity and do not, on their own, form a real image of the specimen. Three types of objectives are in common use today-plan achromats, plan <b>apochromats,</b> and plan fluorite lenses. The concept of mounting video cameras on the microscope is also presented in the chapter...|$|R
50|$|The Iscorama {{range of}} lenses offer {{higher levels of}} optical {{performance}} than comparable consumer-grade anamorphics. All models feature outstanding edge to edge sharpness, and demonstrate very low levels of chromatic aberration, {{although it is not}} certain whether or not the lenses are true achromats or <b>apochromats.</b> The only weakness in the Iscorama optical design appears to be the relatively high levels of complex cylindrical perspective distortion, which is most apparent when the adapters are attached to lenses with focal lengths shorter than 60mm. This deficiency is a notable shortcoming of the 2000 series sealed anamorphics, which suffer from significantly higher levels of cylindrical perspective distortion than the original 1960s Iscorama. It {{should also be noted that}} optical performance is remarkably consistent across the Iscorama range, and reports that the Iscorama 54’s optical characteristics are significantly inferior to other Iscorama models are not accurate. Ironically, this confusion probably results from the superior flexibility of the Iscorama 54 design, which allows it to be attached to a wider range of lens classes than other Iscoramas. Some of these lens categories are optically incompatible with anamorphic adapters; a classic example being wide-angle primes, which create intrusive distortion effects when matched with an anamorphic adapter.|$|R

50|$|Process and <b>apochromat</b> lenses are {{normally}} of small aperture, {{and are used}} for extremely accurate photographs of static objects. Generally their performance is optimized for subjects {{a few inches from}} the front of the lens, and suffers outside this narrow range.|$|E
5000|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is {{the phenomenon}} of different colors focusing at different distances from a lens. In photography, chromatic aberration produces soft overall images, and color fringing at high-contrast edges, like an edge between black and white. Astronomers face similar problems, particularly with telescopes that use lenses rather than mirrors. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. Apochromatic lenses are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (secondary spectrum) can be up to {{an order of magnitude}} less than for an achromatic lens of equivalent aperture and focal length. <b>Apochromats</b> are also corrected for spherical aberration at two wavelengths, rather than one as in an achromat.Telescope objective lenses for wide-band digital imaging in astronomy must have apochromatic correction, as the optical sensitivity of typical CCD imaging arrays can extend from the ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and into the near infrared wavelength range. Apochromatic lenses for astrophotography in the 60-150 mm aperture range have been developed and marketed by several different firms, with focal ratios ranging from [...] to 7. Focused and guided properly during the exposure, these apochromatic objectives are capable of producing the sharpest wide-field astrophotographs optically possible for the given aperture sizes.|$|R

50|$|Some glasses have a {{peculiar}} property called anomalous partial dispersion. Their use in long-focal-length lens assemblies was pioneered by Leitz. Before their availability, calcium fluoride {{in the form}} of fluorite crystals were used as material for these lenses; however the low refraction index of calcium fluoride required high curvatures of the lenses, therefore increasing spherical aberration. Fluorite has poor shape retention and is very fragile. Abnormal dispersion is required for design of <b>apochromat</b> lenses.|$|E
5000|$|Light of {{different}} wavelengths travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes chromatic aberration. Reducing this to acceptable levels usually involves {{a combination of}} two or three aperture sized lenses (see achromat and <b>apochromat</b> for more details). The cost of such systems therefore scales significantly with aperture size. An image obtained from a mirror does not suffer from chromatic aberration to begin with, and the cost of the mirror scales much more modestly with its size.|$|E
50|$|Apochromatic designs require {{optical glasses}} with special {{dispersive}} properties to achieve three color crossings. This is usually achieved using costly fluoro-crown glasses, abnormal flint glasses, and even optically transparent liquids with highly unusual dispersive {{properties in the}} thin spaces between glass elements. The temperature dependence of glass and liquid index of refraction and dispersion must be accounted for during <b>apochromat</b> design to assure good optical performance over reasonable temperature ranges with only slight re-focusing. In some cases, apochromatic designs without anomalous dispersion glasses are possible.|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} setup {{was described}} elsewhere [27]. Briefly, {{it is based}} on a home-made CARS microscope with compact laser source (EKSPLA Ltd., Vilnius, Lithuania). The laser consists of a picosecond (6  ps) frequency-doubled Nd:YVO 4 pump laser with a pulse repetition frequency of 1  MHz and equipped with a travelling wave optical parametric generator (OPG) with a turning range from 690 to 2, 300  nm. For CARS implementation, the OPG radiation was coupled with a fundamental laser radiation (1, 064  nm) used as pump and Stokes excitation beams, respectively. Such mixing provides probing within the 700 to 4, 500  cm- 1 range of vibration frequencies. Both Stokes and pump beams were collinearly combined and directed to an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 71, Center Valley, PA, USA). A spatial filter was used to improve the beam profile before directing into the microscope. The excitation light was focused on the sample with an oil immersion objective (Plan <b>Apochromat,</b> × 60, NA 1.42, Olympus). In the forward detection scheme, the CARS light was collected by another objective with NA 0.4. Long-pass and short-pass filters were used as blocking tools for spectral separation of the CARS signal. CARS radiation was detected using the avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQRH- 14, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) connected to a multifunctional board PCI 7833 R (National Instruments Ltd.

The sample excitation {{is provided by}} the beam from a continuous-wave krypton ion laser, or a synchronously-pumped dye laser, operating at 568 nm. In order to essentially freeze molecular motion due to diffusion and thereby enhance image contrast, the laser beam is first passed through a mechanical shutter, which yields a 3 -millisecond laser exposure for each camera frame. The laser beam strikes the fused-silica/sample interface at an angle exceeding the critical angle by about 1 degree. The resultant evanescent wave penetrates into the sample a depth of approximately 0. 3 microns. Fluorescence from the thin plane of illumination is then imaged onto the camera by a water immersion <b>apochromat</b> (NA 1. 2, WD 0. 2 mm). A Raman notch filter blocks Rayleigh and specular laser scatter and a band-pass-filter blocks most Raman light scatter that originates from the solvent. Single molecules that have diffused into the evanescent zone at the time of laser exposure yield near-diffraction-limited Airy disk images with diameters of ~ 5 pixels. While most molecules diffuse out of the evanescent zone before the next laser exposure, stationary or slowly moving molecules persisting over several frames, and blinking of such molecules, are occasionally observed...|$|E
