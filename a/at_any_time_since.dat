5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the advent of Humanism. Work by those with {{scientific}} as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces {{to achieve an}} {{economic}} revival that continued until {{the close of the}} century. It has been argued that Byzantium under the Komnenian rule was more prosperous than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Persian invasions of the 7th century. During the 12th century, population levels rose and extensive tracts of new agricultural land were brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a notable upsurge in new towns. Trade was also flourishing; the Venetians, the Genoese and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with the Empire via Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, the band's new line-up {{embarked}} {{on a large scale}} world tour. Beginning on 10 May 2005 at the London Astoria, and finishing on 31 March 2006 in front of a sold out gig in Mexico City, Oasis played more live shows than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Definitely Maybe tour, visiting 26 countries and headlining 113 shows for over 3.2 million people. The tour passed without any major incidents and was the band's most successful in more than a decade. The tour included sold out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden and LA's Hollywood Bowl. A rockumentary film made during the tour, entitled Lord Don't Slow Me Down directed by Dick Carruthers was released in October 2007. A second DVD included live footage from an Oasis gig in Manchester from 2 July 2005.|$|E

5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E

Indeed, on 21 March 1968, Sourith was involved in a smuggled C-47 shipment of opium and gold that was impounded in Saigon by Vietnamese customs officials.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} the number of family names to the {{population}} is high in France, {{due to the fact that}} most surnames had many orthographic and dialectal variants (more than 40 for some) which were registered as separate names around 1880 when “” were issued. According to the French Institute for Statistics INSEE, more than 1,300,000 surnames were registered in the country between 1891 and 1990, and about 200,000 disappeared meanwhile (mainly orthographic variants). It is believed that the number of family names <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1990 hovers between 800,000 and 1,200,000. Not all family names are of French origin, as many families have some immigrant roots.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{these and}} similar movements, the {{establishment}} art world produced much less religious painting than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Roman Empire, though {{many types of}} applied art for church fittings in the Gothic style were made. Commercial popular Catholic art flourished using cheaper techniques for mass-reproduction. Colour lithography {{made it possible to}} reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of holy cards. Much of this art continued to use watered-down versions of Baroque styles. The Immaculate Heart of Mary was a new subject of the 19th century, and new apparitions at Lourdes and Fátima, as well as new saints, provided new subjects for art.|$|E
25|$|However, both Bonds' {{accomplishments in}} the 2000s {{have not been}} without controversy.

Bonds has also been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the BALCO drugs scandal, as his personal trainer Greg Anderson pleaded guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between owners and players was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season; in 2010, he admitted to having used steroids throughout his MLB career.|$|E
25|$|When {{treasure}} has {{vested in}} the Crown and {{is to be}} transferred to a museum, the Secretary of State is required to determine whether a reward should be paid by the museum before the transfer to the finder or any other person involved in the finding of the treasure, the occupier of the land {{at the time of the}} find, or any person who had an interest in the land at the time of the find or has had such an interest <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> then. If the Secretary of State determines that a reward should be paid, he or she must also determine the market value of the treasure (assisted by the Treasure Valuation Committee), the amount of the reward (which cannot exceed the market value), to whom the reward should be paid and, if more than one person should be paid, how much each person should receive.|$|E

25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within {{the next year or two}} of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

500|$|Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer {{described}} {{the function of}} portraiture as [...] "preserving a person's appearance after his death". Portraits were objects of status, and served {{to ensure that the}} individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait. As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people than <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel.

50|$|Gate sizing {{depends on}} the overall {{switching}} current of the module <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given <b>time.</b> <b>Since</b> {{only a fraction of}} circuits switch <b>at</b> <b>any</b> point of <b>time,</b> power gate sizes are smaller as compared to the fine-grain switches. Dynamic power simulation using worst-case vectors can determine the worst-case switching for the module and hence the size. The IR drop can also be factored into the analysis. Simultaneous switching capacitance is a major consideration in coarse-grain power gating implementation. In order to limit simultaneous switching, gate control buffers can be daisy chained, and special counters can be used to selectively turn on blocks of switches.|$|R
