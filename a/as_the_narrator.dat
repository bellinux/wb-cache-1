5|$|MediEvil: Resurrection is {{the third}} {{instalment}} in the series and is a re-imagining of the first game. It was released as a launch title on 1 September 2005 in Europe and 13 September 2005 in North America. It was re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2008. Similar to the first game, it {{is set in the}} medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself. Unlike the original, Dan is accompanied by Al-Zalam, a genie whose powers were taken away by Zarok. The game features updated graphics and a variety of voice talents, including Tom Baker <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> and the Grim Reaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} a tribute to the silent films that were played in theaters with musical accompaniment, and 27 minutes of it are entirely dialogue-free. Several types of music are used to express what is not being said; music acts <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator.</b> During Giles' {{overhead}} presentation he plays a recorded version of Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. Buffy and Riley's love theme is presented for the first time when they kiss in this episode. This composition by Christophe Beck—who composed scores for Buffy regularly—pleased Joss Whedon more than the Buffy and Angel love theme. He considered the Buffy-Riley theme more adult, but a bit more strange and blue than the Buffy-Angel theme: a prediction of where the relationship between Buffy and Riley would go.|$|E
40|$|These poems {{represent}} the vanishing {{world of the}} South and that tale is perpetuated {{by a series of}} fathers and sons which often act <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrators.</b> Each father passes his knowledge of language, hunting, lore, loss, and even sins onto the sons who repeat the tradition. The voice and age of <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> evolves from <b>the</b> heavily dialectical to a more educated and contemplative voice <b>as</b> <b>the</b> thesis progresses...|$|R

5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the voice}} actors from the {{previous}} installment returned to reprise their roles, including Terrence C. Carson and Keith Ferguson, who voiced Kratos and the boat captain, respectively. Linda Hunt returned <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator,</b> who was revealed to be the Titan Gaia, and Carole Ruggier returned in her final voicing of the character Athena. Both Paul Eiding, who had voiced Zeus and the gravedigger, and Fred Tatasciore, who had voiced Poseidon, returned but did not reprise those roles, and instead voiced the characters Theseus and Typhon, respectively. Corey Burton {{assumed the role of}} Zeus, who had voiced the character in the 1998 Disney animated film , and in the subsequent animated series Hercules. Famed actors Michael Clarke Duncan and Leigh-Allyn Baker lent their voices for the characters Atlas and Lakhesis, respectively. Actor Harry Hamlin was chosen to voice the character Perseus because of his previous portrayal of the same character in the 1981 feature film Clash of the Titans. Although removed early in the game's development, Cam Clarke is credited for the voice of Hercules. Keythe Farley was the voice director alongside Kris Zimmerman and Gordon Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Part II begins <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> reads {{descriptions}} {{of her father}} and Helen's travels through Eastern Europe during the 1950s.

They travel to Istanbul to find the archives of Sultan MehmedII, which Paul believes contain information regarding {{the location of the}} tomb. They fortuitously meet Professor Turgut Bora from Istanbul University, who has also discovered a book similar to Paul's and Rossi's. He has access to Mehmed's archive, and together they unearth several important documents. They also see the librarian who was supposedly killed in the United States– he has survived because he is a vampire and he has continued following Helen and Paul. Helen shoots the vampire librarian but misses his heart and consequently, he does not die.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
