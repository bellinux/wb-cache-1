5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans <b>and</b> <b>peas</b> were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans <b>and</b> <b>peas</b> were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|By 1829, Randolph {{had three}} {{commission}} warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern. In 1834, Randolph had {{a population of}} approximately 1,000. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, private schools, and more than ten saloons. In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the Randolph Recorder and the Randolph Whig. In the 1830s, the first bank was founded and a stagecoach line provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson twice a week. The commercial success of Randolph can be attributed {{in part to the}} use of slave labor, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans <b>and</b> <b>peas</b> were also cultivated. In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves or offered rewards for runaway or stolen slaves.|$|E

40|$|Cannabinoids {{modulate}} {{intestinal permeability}} through cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1). The endocannabinoid-like compounds oleoylethanolamine (OEA) <b>and</b> palmitoylethanolamine (<b>PEA)</b> {{play an important}} role in digestive regulation, and we hypothesized they would also modulate intestinal permeability. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured in human Caco- 2 cells to assess permeability after application of OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> <b>and</b> relevant antagonists. Cells treated with OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> were stained for cytoskeletal F-actin changes and lysed for immunoassay. OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. OEA (applied apically, logEC 50 − 5. 4) <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> (basolaterally, logEC 50 − 4. 9; apically logEC 50 − 5. 3) increased Caco- 2 resistance by 20 – 30 % via transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) - 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -α. Preventing their degradation (by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase) enhanced the effects of OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA.</b> OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> induced cytoskeletal changes and activated focal adhesion kinase and ERKs 1 / 2, and decreased Src kinases and aquaporins 3 and 4. In Caco- 2 cells treated with IFNγ and TNFα, OEA (via TRPV 1) <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> (via PPARα) prevented or reversed the cytokine-induced increased permeability compared to vehicle (0. 1 % ethanol). PEA (basolateral) also reversed increased permeability when added 48 or 72 h after cytokines (P < 0. 001, via PPARα). Cellular and secreted levels of OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> (P < 0. 001 – 0. 001) were increased in response to inflammatory mediators. OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> have endogenous roles and potential therapeutic applications in conditions of intestinal hyperpermeability and inflammation...|$|R

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice <b>and</b> <b>peas</b> if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize <b>and</b> <b>peas</b> may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists {{turned their}} {{attention}} to the harbour over the next week, placing artillery units on the cliff-tops above it, and bombarding any ships within. On the morning of 22 May, such an attack sunk a barge laden with malt <b>and</b> <b>peas,</b> and was followed by a raiding party of around 50 men that evening, who attacked the harbour, setting fire to the barges that remained. During the fighting to drive them back, Captain Thomas Pyne, who had commanded the town's cavalry, was mortally wounded. Pyne died of fever four days later, despite the attentions of a surgeon. The Earl of Warwick arrived on 23 May with eight ships and the promise of as much help as he could provide, including 400 of his seamen to help garrison the town. Pyne's funeral was held on 27 May, and upon the firing volley from the town's ordnance and musketeers, the besieging army signalled a second attempt to storm the town. The town came under barrage from the enemy batteries, and scaling ladders were brought against the earthen fortifications. Once again the attack was repelled by the town's defenders, and a parley request from Maurice in the immediate aftermath was turned down for fear of treachery.|$|E

5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding the dishes to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream meat pie was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops <b>and</b> <b>peas</b> with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares <b>and</b> <b>peas.</b> Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that PPAR alpha agonists induce N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) <b>and</b> N-palmitoylethanolamide (<b>PEA)</b> biosynthesis. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a known dietary PPAR alpha inducer, may therefore increase OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> levels <b>and</b> favor docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) biosynthesis by enhancing peroxisomal β-oxidation via induction of liver PPARα. To evaluate whether CLA {{is able to}} increase DHA, OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> levels <b>and</b> thereby influencing liver lipid deposition in a model of visceral obesity-induced fatty liver, Zucker rats were fed a background diet rich in saturated fat with or without 1 % of CLA for 4 weeks. Our data showed that CLA intake increased DHA, OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> levels in the liver by 24 %, 31 % and 36 % respectively, and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation by 16 %. We may conclude that dietary CLA is able to influence not only fatty acid metabolism but also the biosynthesis of bioactive mediators such as OEA <b>and</b> <b>PEA</b> which may contribute to ameliorate fatty liver...|$|R
