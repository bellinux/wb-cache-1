5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{inclusion}} of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|Daniels' {{support for}} such {{controversial}} legislation {{led to a}} rapid drop in his approval rating; in May 2005, a poll showed an 18-point drop in support and that only 42% of Hoosiers <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way he was doing his job. In the following months, many of his reforms began {{to have a positive}} effect; and his ratings began to improve, and his approval rebounded.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, {{when he was}} eighteen, Monteux {{married a}} fellow student, the pianist Victoria Barrière. With her he played the {{complete}} Beethoven violin sonatas in public. Neither family <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage; although the Monteux family were not religious, both they and the Roman Catholic Barrières were doubtful about an inter-religious marriage; furthermore, both families thought the couple too young to marry. There were {{a son and a}} daughter from the union.|$|E
5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|Polling firm Public Policy Polling {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Giron's district between September 7 and 9, asking likely voters if they supported the recall of Giron, whether they supported various components of the gun control bill, whether they <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NRA and Governor Hickenlooper, and who {{they would vote for}} in a hypothetical 2014 gubernatorial election between Hickenlooper and Republican Tom Tancredo, as well as various methodological questions. The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% undecided.|$|E

5|$|Several episcopalians, {{supporters}} of the existing system of bishops, were {{also included in the}} summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Assembly. Only one, Daniel Featley, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Country {{received}} a much kinder reception from reviewers and audiences than The Final Frontier. Critics <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blend {{of humor and}} adventure in the film. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 83% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 48, with an average score of 6.8/10.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of SR-103, {{outside of the}} roadway renumbering, have received some technical changes as well. In November 1992, UDOT confirmed that the interchange of I-15 and SR-103 (exit 335) was to be given traffic lights to help monitor traffic. The mayor at the time, Neldon Hamblin, <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, and put the project up for bids for construction. The interchange was holding up motorists needing to turn left up to 20 minutes.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1830 {{election}} {{victory of}} the more progressive Whigs, though {{he was concerned about}} the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E

5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
5|$|Friendly {{generally}} <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{first version}} but {{believed that it}} was necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who was known for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E

5|$|Fuqua {{was fired}} on October 1, 2004, four weeks before {{principal}} photography would begin. The studio cited creative differences for the director's departure. After Fuqua's departure, the studio met with Peter Berg {{to take over}} directing the film, and Denzel Washington had <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choice. Due to the search potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal canceled production of American Gangster, citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason. The cancellation cost the studio $30million, of which $20million went to Washington and $5million went to del Toro due to their pay or play contracts.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the {{governor}} of Tennessee, appointed the state's attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of Middle Tennessee. Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a neutral state at that time. Moving upriver, just inside the Tennessee border, Donelson selected {{the site of the}} fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Tennessee Corps of Engineers <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E

Mawlid {{is recognized as}} a national holiday in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim-majority countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world except Saudi Arabia and Qatar which are officially Wahhabi/Salafi. Shaykh Faraz Rabbani states that the Mawlid is generally <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> across <b>the</b> four Islamic schools of law and by mainstream Islamic scholarship.|$|R
