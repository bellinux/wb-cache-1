25|$|A {{political}} liberal, he is {{the author}} of a number of books <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> law, including Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow Case (1985), the basis of the 1990 film; Chutzpah (1991); Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O.J. Simpson Case (1996); the best-selling The Case for Israel (2003); Rights From Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004) and The Case for Peace (2005).|$|E
25|$|Murgescu {{spent the}} last stage of {{his life as a}} dissident, in latent {{conflict}} with Ceaușescu. At the IEM, he helped organize debates <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> economics, introduced Romanian students to the core notions of supply-side economics, and made hints about the need for profound change. Reportedly, Murgescu's 1982 work on the Japanese economic miracle was a Romanian best-seller. Allegedly, Murgescu had come to believe that the Valev Plan was a consistent form of economic integration, and that national communism was essentially flawed.|$|E

25|$|Daood Gilani {{was raised}} in a {{political}} environment steeped in Pakistani nationalism and Islamic conservatism, both of which were amplified by Pakistani tensions with India. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, stray bombs hit Gilani's elementary school in Karachi and killed two people; this event, along with Pakistan's defeat at the war's conclusion, is thought to have stoked Gilani's animus towards India. Gilani went on to attend the elite Cadet College Hasan Abdal, a boys' military prep school. Gilani remained in contact with classmates, and later engaged in impassioned debates with them <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> Islam in e-mail correspondence.|$|E
25|$|The artwork {{produced}} by the refugee students at the art school was quite {{different from that of}} the other students. They “were doing harsh and emotional art fuelled by bitterness and anger. They had long conversations about Käthe Kollwitz and swapped books and newspapers <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> art in Europe. Picasso’s Guernica of 1937 and his other war-inspired painting and sculpture and the work of other European artists were now the subject of endless discussion.” However, the cultural transition was not all one way. The Glasgow choirs sang Scottish folk songs and Afro-American spirituals: music that had been suppressed in Germany and was a revelation to refugees like King, who understood its relevance to the times.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee {{began his}} legal career in Calgary, and the UFA {{was one of}} his firm's major clients. One of the {{projects}} he undertook for it was the creation of the United Grain Growers (UGG), of whose securities division he became general manager in 1919. [...] He also travelled around Alberta with UFA president Henry Wise Wood answering UFA members' legal questions while Wood spoke to them <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> the farmers' movement. Though Brownlee was not initially interested in the UFA's political activities, this changed through his association with Wood and Progressive Party of Canada leader Thomas Crerar.|$|E

500|$|... "The eldest, Olga Nicolaevna, {{possessed a}} remarkably quick brain", {{recalled}} her Swiss tutor, Pierre Gilliard. [...] "She had good reasoning powers {{as well as}} initiative, a very independent manner, and a gift for swift and entertaining repartee." [...] She enjoyed reading <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> read newspapers. Olga also reportedly enjoyed choosing from her mother's book selection. When she was caught taking a book before her mother read it, Olga would jokingly tell her mother that Alexandra must wait to read the novel until Olga had determined whether it was an appropriate book for her to read.|$|E
500|$|Simpsons writer Bill Oakley {{said in the}} 2005 DVD {{commentary}} on the episode that the motivation for the phrase on the show was to emphasize how [...] "think of the children" [...] was used in debate; irrelevant, it sidetracked discussion from the original issues. Lovejoy used variations of the phrase, including [...] "Oh, won't somebody please think of the children" [...] and [...] "What about the children", shrieking it most often when residents of the fictional town of Springfield debated a contentious problem or argued <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> logic failed. Lovejoy's comic use of the phrase on The Simpsons satirized its use in public discourse.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Tom and April {{continue}} {{to make fun of}} Leslie, much to the displeasure of Mark. Mark, who tells the documentary crew he is impressed that Leslie has somehow maintained her optimism about government for six years, secretly asks Ron to give her the park project. Mark said doing so would return a favor Ron owes him for unspecified reasons. Leslie and Ann are extremely excited about the new exploratory subcommittee, and the department celebrates by getting drunk. Despite her skepticism <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> government, a drunken Ann pledges {{to do whatever it takes}} to help get the pit filled in, [...] "even if it takes two months". The episode ends with Ron explaining to the documentary crew how he makes his office as uninviting as possible.|$|E

500|$|During the 1920s, Oppenheimer {{remained}} aloof from worldly matters. He {{claimed that}} he did not read newspapers or listen to the radio, and had only learned of the Wall Street crash of 1929 some six months after it occurred while on a walk with Ernest Lawrence. He once remarked that he never cast a vote until the 1936 election. However, from 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> international affairs. In 1934, he earmarked three percent of his salary—about $100 a year—for two years to support German physicists fleeing from Nazi Germany. During the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike, he and some of his students, including Melba Phillips and Bob Serber, attended a longshoremen's rally. Oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to get Serber a position at Berkeley but was blocked by Birge, who felt that [...] "one Jew in the department was enough".|$|E
500|$|The network televises U.S. {{political}} events, particularly {{live and}} [...] "gavel-to-gavel" [...] {{coverage of the}} U.S. Congress as well as occasional proceedings of the Canadian, Australian and British Parliaments (including the weekly Prime Minister's Questions), {{as well as other}} major events worldwide. Its coverage of political and policy events is unedited, thereby providing viewers (or listeners) with unfiltered information <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> government. Non-political coverage includes historical programming, programs dedicated to non-fiction books, and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy. C-SPAN is a private, nonprofit organization, funded by a 6¢ per subscriber affiliate fee paid by its cable and satellite affiliates, and does not have advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations, or websites, nor does it ever solicit donations or pledges. The network operates independently, and neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of the content of its programming.|$|E
500|$|W. Bryan Rommel Ruiz {{has argued}} that despite factual {{inaccuracies}} in its depiction of the Reconstruction period, Gone with the Wind nevertheless reflects contemporary interpretations that were common in the early 20th century. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering freedman: a government official can be heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes. The inference is taken to be that freedmen are ignorant <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> unprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials. While perpetuating some Lost Cause myths, the film makes concessions in regards to others. After the attack on Scarlett in the shanty town, {{a group of men}} including Scarlett's husband Frank, Rhett Butler and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the Ku Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's virtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in the film by referring to it only as a [...] "political meeting".|$|E

500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
500|$|That November, Joe Russo {{stated that}} {{the theme of the}} film was betrayal, calling it [...] "extremely emotional. [...] hinges on that emotion, and on a very {{personal}} level we didn't want [...] to become <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> people arguing about platitudes. The third act is built around a very personal moment between [...]" [...] The Russos {{spent a great deal of}} time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point [...] "you have to sacrifice logic for expediency". Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months." [...] They also {{stated that the}} film would be doing [...] "a few reshoots" [...] in mid-to-late January.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Peter Wolf rebuked {{the record}} company's unforseeably abrupt edict as being [...] "only <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> greed ... {{nothing to do}} with the talent" [...] and that it was [...] "Purely a {{business}} decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|Egypt, Japan and China, also in 1905. After {{the victory}} of the Japanese Empire over the Russians, Gómez Carrillo {{convinced}} the director of the newspapers for whom he worked to allow him to visit the Far East. The voyage's goal was to inform the readers of El Liberal and La Nación {{about what was going on}} in Japan after its victory, the consequence of the war and what was the path of this powerful empire, but his notes not only talk <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> the social customs of those countries; they also talk about the erotic customs and traditions of those places. [...] His work appeared in two books: ...|$|E
2500|$|Social ecologists, also {{considered}} {{a kind of}} socialist anarchist, often criticize the main currents of anarchism for their focus and debates <b>about</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> economics instead of a focus on eco-system (human and environmental). This theory promotes libertarian municipalism and green technology. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize mainstream anarchism for supporting civilization and modern technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation. [...] They instead advocate the process of rewilding or reconnecting with the natural environment. Veganarchism is the political philosophy of veganism (more specifically animal liberation) and green anarchism. This encompasses viewing the state as unnecessary and harmful to both human and animals, whilst practising a vegan diet.|$|E
