50|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>leach</b> {{solutions}} {{from some}} copper mines can contain {{large quantities of}} Fe(III) as well as Cu(II). The “free acid” (sulfuric acid) content of these leach solutions is a critical process parameter. While thermometric titrimetry can determine the free acid content with modest amounts of Fe(III), in some solutions the Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference. Complexation with necessarily large amounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent. A thermometric titration was devised by diluting the aliquot with propan-2-ol and titration with standard KOH in propan-2-ol. Most of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration, and a clear, sharp endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained.|$|E

The pyrolysis of <b>acid</b> <b>leached</b> pinewood resulted in more organic oil and less water and residue compared to untreated pinewood over the whole temperature range. Below 500 °C the difference was most profound; for <b>acid</b> <b>leached</b> pinewood at 360 °C the organic oil was already 650 g kg− 1 pine with a sugar yield of 230 g kg− 1 pine.

Low reactor temperatures also favored the production of monomeric phenols, though their absolute yields remained low for both untreated and leached pine (maximum: 23 g kg− 1 pine, 80 g kg− 1 lignin).

50|$|This is {{achieved}} in practice {{through a process}} called double leaching. The calcine is first leached in a neutral or slightly acidic solution (of sulfuric acid) in order to leach the zinc out of the zinc oxide.
