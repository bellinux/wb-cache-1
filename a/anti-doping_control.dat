40|$|Background: {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} of use, beliefs and attitude towards doping substances and practices among Italian athletes are scarce. Methods: we interviewed 508 Italian athletes in sports facilities, using an anonymous structured questionnaire to collect information on the athletes’ beliefs about the role in performance and side effects of selected doping practices and substances, the reasons for use, obstacles in obtaining drugs, responsibility in the decision, changes in use in recent years, and <b>anti-doping</b> <b>controls.</b> Results: among the athletes, 88. 2 % believed that supplements were effective to improve performance and 4. 8 % that they were potentially dangerous. They believed that 87. 0 % of top-level athletes frequently use supplements, namely 69. 1 % anti-inflammatories and 56. 9 % creatine. Doping was widespread {{in the opinion of}} 87. 4 % of athletes, and 45. 3 % thought it was used at all competition levels.

40|$|Administration of {{prohibited}} substances to enhance athletic performance represents an emerging medical, social, ethical and legal issue. Traditional controls {{are based on}} direct detection of substances or their catabolites. However out-of-competition doping may not be easily revealed by standard analytical methods. Alternative indirect control strategies {{are based on the}} evaluation of mid- and long-term effects of doping in tissues. Drug-induced long-lasting changes of gene expression may be taken as effective indicators of doping exposure. To validate this approach, we used real-time PCR to monitor the expression pattern of selected genes in human haematopoietic cells exposed to nandrolone, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or growth hormone (GH). Some candidate genes were found significantly and consistently modulated by treatments. Nandrolone up-regulated AR, ESR 2 and PGR in K 562 cells, and SRD 5 A 1, PPARA and JAK 2 in Jurkat cells; IGF-I up-regulated EPOR and PGR in HL 60 cells, and SRD 5 A 1 in Jurkat; GH up-regulated SRD 5 A 1 and GHR in K 562. GATA 1 expression was down-regulated in IGF- 1 -treated HL 60, ESR 2 was down-regulated in nandrolone-treated Jurkat, and AR and PGR were down-regulated in GH-treated Jurkat.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of gene doping, {{defined as the}} transfer of nucleic acid sequences and/or the use of normal or genetically modified cells to enhance sport performance, is a real concern in sports medicine. The abuse of knowledge and techniques gained {{in the area of}} gene therapy is a form of doping, and is prohibited for competitive athletes. As yet there is no conclusive evidence that that gene doping has been practiced in sport. However, given that gene therapy techniques improve continuously, the likelihood of abuse will increase. A literature search was conducted to identify the most relevant proteins based on their current gene doping potential using articles from Pubmed, Scopus and Embase published between 2006 and 2011. The final list of selected proteins were erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, myostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, endorphin and enkephalin, a actinin 3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR delta) and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C). We discuss these proteins with respect to their potential benefits, existing gene therapy experience in humans, potential risks, and chances of detection in current and future <b>anti-doping</b> <b>controls.</b> We have identified PPARd and PEPCK-C as having high potential for abuse. But we expect that for efficiency reasons, there will be a preference for inserting gene target combinations rather than single gene doping products.

40|$|The {{misuse of}} {{human growth hormone}} (hGH) in sport is deemed to be {{unethical}} and dangerous because of various adverse effects. Thus, it {{has been added to}} the International Olympic Committee list of banned substances. Until now, the very low concentration of hGH in the urine made its measurement difficult using classical methodology. Indeed, for routine diagnosis, only plasma measurements were available. However, unlike blood samples, urine is generally provided in abundant quantities and is, at present, the only body fluid allowed to be analysed in sport doping controls. A recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Norditest) makes it now possible, without any extraction, to measure urinary hGH (u-hGH) in a dynamic range of 2 - 50 ng hGH/l. In our protocol, untreated and treated non-athlete volunteers were followed. Some of them received therapeutical doses of recombinant hGH (Norditropin) for one week either intramuscularly (three increasing doses) or subcutaneously (12 i. u. every day). The u-hGH excretion after treatment showed dramatic increases of 50 - 100 times the basal values and returned to almost the mean normal level after 24 h. u-hGH was also measured in samples provided by the <b>anti-doping</b> <b>controls</b> at major and minor competitions. Depending on the type of efforts made during the competition, the hGH concentration in urine was dramatically increased.

40|$|Coaches {{may have}} a {{significant}} role in an athlete’s decision to use, or not to use, performance enhancing substances. Research suggests that many coaches do not have the confidence or the knowledge to discuss anti-doping issues with their athletes. This study aimed to assess coaches’ awareness of doping practices, coaches’ knowledge of <b>anti-doping</b> <b>control</b> systems (random testing, out of competition testing, the biological passport and the athlete whereabouts system) and coaches’ involvement with anti-doping education for their athletes. Individual interviews were conducted with 19 elite or professional level coaches representing the sports of basketball, cricket, hockey, soccer, rowing, ski cross, taekwondo, swimming and triathlon. The findings suggest that although many coaches personally know doping athletes, few believe that athletes will ever be tested. Knowledge of <b>anti-doping</b> <b>control</b> systems, specifically the biological passport and the whereabouts system was very poor. Coaches rarely discuss doping themes with their athletes or other coaches. Taken together these findings paint a worrying picture of the state of coaches’ knowledge of doping and their commitment to anti-doping education and awareness. While anti-doping education must become a standard part of the coaching education process, this should be backed with strict compliance legislation that obliges coaches to take part in continuous education and provide proof that they provide preventive measures for their athletes.

The Federation Equestre Internationale-FEI, through the European Horserace Scientific Liaison Committee-EHSLC, has proposed a detection time of 168 h for PBZ in blood based on a LOD of 0. 050 lg ml) 1. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma clearance of PBZ in healthy horses following both intravenous and oral administration of two commercial products marketed in Italy at the maximum dosage regimen, recommended by the manufacturer. MATERIALS AND METHODS PBZ was administered to horses intravenously (n = 6) or orally (n= 6) at a dose rate of 4. 4 mgkg) 1 once daily for five consecutive days. Both experiments involved six thoroughbred horses (three females and three males) weighing from 450 to 600 kg and aged 5 – 11 years. Blood (10 ml) samples were collected before the last dose (t 0) and then after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h; and every 12 h for 10 days after treatment. Plasma levels of PBZ and its major metabolite OPBZ were measured by HPLC-UV (LOD = 0. 025 lg ml) 1). The study was conducted with the approval of the ethic committee of the University of Pisa. RESULTS Plasma PBZ and OPBZ concentrations, after both intravenous and oral administration, showed a rapid elimination profile and were below the LOD at 84 h after the administration of the last dose. Plasma levels of OPBZ were 25 % or less of the concentra- tions of PBZ, showing a rapid elimination profile and being less than LOD at 84 h after the administration of the last dose. At 168 h both plasma PBZ and OPBZ were not detectable in any horse. The oral bioavailability of PBZ was 23 %. CONCLUSIONS Plasma elimination profile of the two commercial formulations of PBZ investigated in this study was rapid. The detection time suggested by the FEI for PBZ is largely protective.

These studies have resulted in the setting up of an <b>anti-doping</b> <b>control</b> for equestrian competitions of various types, not only flat racing. During events, horses, must be calm and docile to the riders' order. Frequently, the latter use tranquillizers to try and win events. The analytical method for the research and identification of these compounds is described. The technique involves successively: 1. alkalinisation of the sample - saliva, blood or urine after enzymatic hydrolysis. 2. extraction with diethyl ether - the recovery is 70 % to 90 % depending upon the drug. 3. determination by gas-liquid chromatography with use of a retention index for qualitative analysis. We can detect up to fifteen tranquillizers in any one sample, even when present at such low concentrations as found in saliva. The use of the retention index is a reliable method for qualitative analysis. For example, the method has been used for three years, during which period the rentention index of acetylpromazine remained at 3240 +/- 7. The chromatographic analysis was performed on 3 % OV- 17 at 290 degrees. The chromatographic analysis has been performed by three columns of different polarity (OV- 1; OV- 17; SP- 2250).
