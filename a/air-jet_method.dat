40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Two completely different approaches {{have been used to}} study the mechanism of the <b>air-jet</b> <b>method</b> of bulking filament yarns. Part A is an aerodynamic study {{of the nature of the}} air flow and of its characteristics, and of the yarn's behaviour during the bulking process. The experimentation involves the use of scaled-up models of the du Pant type 9 commercial Taslan air-jet and of a typically used parent yarn. The study is extended to include a modification of the jet suggested by earlier workers. The results of these investigations provide new evidence regarding the mechanism of the process and the construction of bulked yarns of this type. It is also concluded that the commercially used air-jet on which the model study has been based, is not ideally designed from the stand-point of efficiency, stability and ease of operation. In Part B, a suggested mechanism of the air-jet bulking action is simulated by a purely mechanical means. The simulation of the process has been so effective that yarns of the air-jet bulked type are produced by a method not requiring any compressed air. The preliminary work leading to the design of an experimental apparatus is briefly reported. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the process are made, and the bulked yarn properties for various parent yarn particulars and processing conditions are measured and assessed. An economic evaluation of the process has been attempted, based on a comparison with the limited cost figures available for Taslan processing. - The individual nature of each of the two main investigations has necessitated that the results should be separately discussed in the ultimate Chapter of each Part of the thesis. Suggestions for further work are also made for each of the two techniques...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new <b>air-jet</b> {{spinning}} <b>method</b> for {{the preparation of}} contin-uous twisted nanofiber yarns. The nozzle-twisting device is designed to create the 3 -D rotating airflow to twist nanofiber bundles. The airflow characteristics inside the twisting chamber are studied numerically. The airflow field distribution {{and its effect on}} nanofiber yarn spinning at different pressures are also discussed. Key words: airflow field, nanofiber, yarn structure, mechanical propertie...|$|R
40|$|The {{entrapment}} of enzymes, drugs, {{cells or}} tissue fragments in alginates cross-linked with Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + has great potential in basic research, biotechnology and medicine. The swelling properties and, in turn, the mechanical stability are key factors in designing an optimally cross-linked hydrogel matrix. These parameters depend critically on the cross-linking process and seemingly minor modifications in manufacture {{have a large}} impact. Thus, sensitive and non-invasive tools are required to determine the spatial homogeneity and efficacy of the cross-linking process. Here, we show for alginate microcapsules (between 400 mum and 600 mum in diameter) that advanced H- 1 NMR imaging, along with paramagnetic Cu 2 + as contrast agent, {{can be used to}} validate the cross-linking process. Two- and three-dimensional images and maps of the spin-lattice relaxation time T- 1 of Ba 2 + cross-linked microcapsules exposed to external Cu 2 + yielded qualitative as well as quantitative information about the accumulation of Cu 2 + within and removal from microcapsules upon washing with Cu 2 + free saline solution. The use of Cu 2 + (having a slightly higher affinity constant to alginate than Ba 2 +) for gelling gave a complementary insight into the spatial homogeneity of the cross-linking process together with information about the mechanical stability of the microcapsules. The potential of this technique was demonstrated for alginates extracted from two different algal sources and cross-linked either externally by the conventional <b>air-jet</b> dropping <b>method</b> or internally by the 'crystal gun' method...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} progress report we {{indicated that the}} distribution of fibers within the yarn structure strongly influences the mechanical behavior of the resulting yarns. In this report period we are reporting {{the analysis of the}} twist distribution in the spinning zone of an air-jet spinning system, and the effect of the use of an MIY device in Jet Spinning. TWIST DISTRIBUTION IN SPINNING ZONE OF AIR-JET SPINNING In t roduct ion <b>Air-jet</b> spinning <b>method</b> is akin to false-twisting of a yarn. The main bundle of fibers is under the false-twisting action of an air vortex. It is, therefore, important to know the twist distribution in the main bundle along the traveling direction of the yarn in the spinning zone. It was earlier thought that the twist in the core bundle along the yarn threadline prior to the twister remains constant as assumed by Krause et a 1 [l]. However, Grosberg et a 1 [2) have published their experimental evidence claiming {{that this is not the}} case. Lunenschloss and Bergmann [3] have reported the photographic evidence that the false-twist of the core decays gradually after the second twisting jet, as cited by Schwabe et a 1 [4]. The experimental evidence reported in the literature indicates that core twist must vary along the threadline in air-jet spinning. However, the published results are not in general agreement with each other, and there appears to be a need to re-analyze {{the previous}} work. The notation of symbols in the following analysis are as follows: I: Moment of inertial per unit length of yarn; K: Yarn torsional rigidity; k: A positive constant; 1 : Distance between the front-roller nip and delivery-roller nip...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{defining}} {{strategies to}} reduce haptic information complexity, with minimum loss of information, to design more effective haptic interfaces and artificial systems. Nowadays, haptic device design can be complex. Moreover, the artificial {{reproduction of the}} full spectrum of haptic information is a daunting task and far to be achieved. The central idea of this work is to simplify this information by exploiting the concept of synergies, which has been developed to describe the covariation patterns in multi-digit movements and forces in common motor tasks. Here I extend and exploit it also in the perceptual domain, to find projections from the heterogeneous information manifold, generated by the mechanics of touch, and what can be actually perceived by humans. In this manner, design trade-off between costs, feasibility and quality of the rendered perception can be individuated. With this as motivation, referring to cutaneous sensing, I discuss the development of a fabric-based softness display inspired by ``Contact Area Spread Rate'' hypothesis as well as the characterization of an <b>air-jet</b> lump display <b>method</b> for Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery. Considering kinaesthesia, I analyze the problem of hand posture estimation from noisy and limited in number measures provided by low cost hand pose sensing devices. By using the information about how humans most frequently use their hands, system performance is enhanced and optimal system design enabled. Finally, an integrated device, where a conventional kinaesthetic haptic display is combined with a cutaneous softness one, is proposed, showing that the fidelity by which softness is artificially rendered increases...|$|R
