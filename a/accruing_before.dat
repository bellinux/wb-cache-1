40|$|The WTO law of {{remedies}} for violation appears incoherent. States {{that fail to}} comply with their obligations are subject to WTO-authorized retaliation. First, this retaliation takes the inefficient form of blocked trade by the complaining state. This remedy {{is unlikely to be}} useful to developing countries. Second, the amount of trade blocked by the violation is often used as the measure of authorized retaliation. This measure is not necessarily incentive compatible, as it is not necessarily linked to welfare. Thus, its use may result in inefficient breach, or inefficient compliance, with WTO law. Third, only states that engage in dispute resolution proceedings are authorized to retaliate, artificially reducing the possible incentives to comply. Fourth, authorization to retaliate is granted only prospectively, and there are generally no formal {{remedies for}} damages <b>accruing</b> <b>before</b> adjudication and the passage of permitted time for compliance. This also artificially reduces incentives to comply. This paper analyzes the rationale for, and structure of, welfare-based remedies that could form the basis for cash compensation in WTO law...|$|E
40|$|Prior to 1946, {{in order}} for tribal Indians {{to gain access to}} courts for {{consideration}} of claims arising out of treaties between Indians and the United States, a special act of Congress was required in each case conferring jurisdiction on the court of claims to hear a tribe 2 ̆ 7 s grievance. Long delays, expense, and in many cases denial of access to court for Indians resulted. Seeking to remedy the situation, in 1946, Congress enacted the Indian Claims Commission Act. Under the Act, an Indian Claims Commission was given extremely broad jurisdiction to adjudicate the many outstanding Indian claims, including those 2 ̆ 2 based upon fair and honorable dealings that are not recognized by any existing rule of law or equity. 2 ̆ 2 The Indian Claims Commission Act was applicable, however, only to claims <b>accruing</b> <b>before</b> August 13, 1946, and the Commission itself was to terminate within ten years of its first meeting.

40|$|Although early {{epidemiologic}} {{studies showed}} a protective effect of adequate maternal folic acid (FA) status against neural tube defects (NTDs), {{the role of}} adequate vitamin B- 12 nutrition in the putative reduction of NTD frequency has remained uncertain. Evaluating vitamin B- 12 status was complicated {{by the need to}} control for altered FA status after fortification in Canada. More recent studies have made use of better biomarkers of vitamin B- 12 status, includ-ing methylmalonic acid and holotranscobalamin (holoTC). HoloTC provides a useful measure of vitamin B- 12 status because it repre-sents the bioavailable fraction of circulating vitamin B- 12.

40|$|Introduction: In {{occupational}} epidemiology, {{differences in}} the temporal coverage of the exposure history by available exposure measurement data may affect the uncertainty of exposure estimates. In the reporting of results of studies, greater attention should {{be paid to the}} extent to which exposure assessments require extrapolation outside the timeframe for which exposure measurements are available. We propose a simple graphical method that can be used to visualise the temporal coverage of exposure history with exposure measurements and the extent of temporal extrapolation needed. Methods: We construct a graph that displays the accumulated work history years for which exposure had to be assessed in each calendar year. Years for which exposure measurements were available are shaded. The proportion of work history years covered by exposure measurements and the proportion of work history years <b>accrued</b> <b>before</b> the first measurements are summarised. When available, the actual number of measurements available in each calendar year is shown. Results: We demonstrate the application of the graphical tool in three nested case-control studies that reported on leukaemia in relation to low-level benzene exposures in the petroleum industry. Considerable differences in temporal coverage between the studies were illustrated, which may have resulted in {{differences in the}} reliability of the retrospective exposure estimates derived for these studies. Conclusion: We introduce a graphical tool for visualising the temporal coverage by available exposure measurement data in epidemiological studies and encourage others to use similar graphs to derive and share better qualitative insights into the uncertainty in exposure assessment...|$|R

Methods We populated the Markov model of HIV-disease with data from ACTG 5142 study to estimate the economic outcomes of starting ARV therapy with a PI-containing regimen as compared to an NNRTI-containing regimen, given their virologic and immunologic efficacy and effects on cholesterol and lipoatrophy. CNS toxicities and GI tolerability {{were not included in}} the model because of their transient nature or low cost remedies, and therefore lack of economic impact. CD 4 + T-cell counts and the HIV- 1 RNA (viral load) values from the study were used to assign a specific health state (HS) to each patient for each quarter year. The resulting frequencies used as "raw" data directly into the model obviate the reliance on statistical tests, and allow the model to reflect actual patient behavior in the clinical trial. An HS just below the last observed HS was used to replace a missing value. Results The modeled estimates (undiscounted) for the LPV/r-based regimen resulted in 1. 41 quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) gained over a lifetime compared to the EFV-based regimen. The LPV/r-based regimen incurred $ 7, 458 (1. 8 %) greater cost over a lifetime due to differences in drug costs and survival. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio using the discounted cost and QALYs was $ 88, 829 /QALY. Most of the higher costs <b>accrue</b> <b>before</b> the 7 th year of treatment and were offset by subsequent savings. The estimates are highly sensitive to the effect of lipoatrophy on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL), but not to the effect of cholesterol levels.
