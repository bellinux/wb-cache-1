This thesis presents a robotic rehabilitation approach based on repetitive passive exercise aimed to help early stage stroke survivors exercise their finger doing extension and flexion at the comfort of their home. This exercise for the finger's muscle is crucial in order to delay if not prevent it from suffering spasticity and contracture which can cause pain to the patient. This research was to obtain the configuration of a finger for kinematic analysis, to design an optimized finger exoskeleton module to assist finger movement, and to evaluate shape memory alloy (SMA) to be used as device actuator. Mathematical simulations of a two compound pendulum which represent simplified model of a finger were done based on Lagrangian equations, controlled using proportional-derivative (PD) feedback controller providing necessary torque to direct the links to mimic actual finger trajectory from flexed to extended position. The maximum value of torque recorded was at at 0. 0030 Nm for proximal and 0. 0027 Nm for distal. A new finger rehabilitation mechanical module was designed with the concept of exoskeleton for optimal style of finger handling and ease of use. It focuses on moving two main phalanges of the finger, proximal and medial phalange. The device. Cable <b>Actuated</b> <b>finger</b> Kxoskeleton (CAFFx) deploys Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire as an under-actuation approach to deliver the needed 2 -DOF movement. The advantages and challenges of using SMA wires rather than conventional actuators are discussed. However, a prototype of another similar finger rehabilitation device.

40|$|Today's cellphones are passive {{communication}} portals. They {{are neither}} {{aware of our}} conversational settings, nor {{of the relationship between}} caller and callee, and often interrupt us at inappropriate times. This thesis is about adding elements of human style social intelligence to our mobile communication devices in order to make them more socially acceptable to both user and local others. I suggest the concept of an Autonomous Interactive Intermediary that assumes the role of an actively mediating party between caller, callee, and co-located people. In order to behave in a socially appropriate way, the Intermediary interrupts with non-verbal cues and attempts to harvest 'residual social intelligence' from the calling party, the called person, the people close by, and its current location. For example, the Intermediary obtains the user's conversational status from a decentralized network of autonomous body-worn sensor nodes. These nodes detect conversational groupings in real time, and provide the Intermediary with the user's conversation size and talk-to-listen ratio. The Intermediary can 'poll' all participants of a face-to-face conversation about the appropriateness of a possible interruption by slightly vibrating their wirelessly <b>actuated</b> <b>finger</b> rings. (cont.) Although the alerted people do not know if it is their own cellphone that is about to interrupt, each of them can veto the interruption anonymously by touching his/her ring. If no one vetoes, the Intermediary may interrupt. A user study showed significantly more vetoes during a collaborative group-focused setting than during a less group oriented setting. The Intermediary is implemented as a both a conversational agent and an animatronic device. The animatronics is a small wireless robotic stuffed animal {{in the form of a}} squirrel, bunny, or parrot. The purpose of the embodiment is to employ intuitive non-verbal cues such as gaze and gestures to attract attention, instead of ringing or vibration. Evidence suggests that such subtle yet public alerting by animatronics evokes significantly different reactions than ordinary telephones and are seen as less invasive by others present when we receive phone calls. The Intermediary is also a dual conversational agent that can whisper and listen to the user, and converse with a caller, mediating between them in real time. (cont.) The Intermediary modifies its conversational script depending on caller identity, caller and user choices, and the conversational status of the user. It interrupts and communicates with the user when it is socially appropriate, and may break down a synchronous phone call into chunks of voice instant messages. by Stefan Johannes Walter Marti.

40|$|The {{extensor}} digitorum communis (ED) is {{a slender}} muscle {{group in the}} dorsal forearm from which tendons arise to the index (D 2), medius (D 3), ring (D 4), and little (D 5) fingers. Limited independence {{has been attributed to}} the parts that <b>actuate</b> the individual <b>fingers.</b> However, in a detailed anatomical analysis, {{it was found that the}} ED parts to the different fingers have constant and widely spaced anatomical locations that promote independent function. These observations and the superficial muscle belly locations prompted the hypothesis that these ED parts would be individually assessable by small anatomically placed surface EMG electrodes. In the present study, this hypothesis was evaluated by measuring electromyography (EMG) from the ED parts and surrounding muscles during individual finger tapping tasks with the forearm resting on a flat surface. It was found that individual ED activity can be well measured in ED 2, ED 3, ED 4, and extensor digiti minimi (EDM). ED 3 did not give nor did its electrodes receive significant crosstalk from other ED parts. ED 4 electrodes recorded an EMG level of 30 +/- 19 % (mean +/- SD) ED 2 EMG in D 2 tapping and ED 2 electrodes a level of 53 +/- 22 % ED 4 EMG in D 4 tapping, by hypothesis mostly crosstalk. EDM electrodes may record EMG at the level of ED 4 EMG in D 4 tapping. In D 2 tapping, the mutual ED 2 and extensor indicis redundancy reflected in large intersubject EMG differences with sometimes one or the other almost silent. The results may expand the possibilities of EMG analysis and finger muscle electrostimulation in ergonomic and clinical applications. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

En gummihand (rubber hand på engelska) är en konstgjord hand som används inom studier av kroppsuppfattning och ägande, vilka utgör ett viktigt område inom studier av människans medvetande. Forskare kan skapa hos testdeltagare illusionen av att en konstgjord hand är en del av en deras kropp. För att förstärka illusionen så kan en kosmetisk proteshandske användas. Ytterligare en del av kroppsbilden är känslan av att orsaka en händelse i den yttre världen. En rörlig gummihand är ett värdefullt verktyg för att studera känslan av både orsakandeoch ägande, som kan hållas isär ändå. Tanken är att en testdeltagare ska kunna fjärrstyra denrörliga gummihanden. För att studera ändringar i hjärnans aktivitet under illusionens gång så måste deltagaren befinna sig i en MR-skanner och undergå en så kallad funktionell MRundersökning. Därför behövde alla delar och komponenter i den rörliga gummihanden vara MRkompatibla. For this thesis, {{an initial}} {{prototype}} for an actuated rubber {{hand with the}} index <b>finger</b> <b>actuated,</b> was designed and manufactured. A rubber hand is an artificial hand used for studies of body image and ownership, {{an integral part of}} research on consciousness in human beings. With an artificial hand, researchers can create an illusion in which a subject can believe that the artificial hand is part of their body. To increase the immersion into the illusion, a cosmetic prosthetic glove can be used for added realism. Another integral part of body image is the sense of agency, in which a subject believes to be the source of an event in the external world. To study agency, while separating agency from ownership, a moving rubber hand is a useful tool. The idea is that a subject is to control the moving rubber hand remotely with their own hand. To be able to study the changes in brain activity during the onset of the illusion, the subject needs to be in an MRI scanner and undergo a so called functional MRI analysis. Therefore, all the materials and components in the actuated rubber hand needed to be MRI compatible...|$|R
