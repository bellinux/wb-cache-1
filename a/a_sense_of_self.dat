25|$|Culture {{not only}} {{influences}} {{the age at}} which the reminiscence bump appears but also the content of the memories found within the bump. Western cultures often value individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are encouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group solidarity, communion, and interconnectedness, where individuals are encouraged to develop <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> that is aligned with social roles, duties, and responsibilities. The differences in societal norms expressed by Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals from Western cultures have memories that cast the individual as the central character and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals from Asian cultures have memories that express a strong group orientation and often have relation-centered autobiographical memories.|$|E

They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. [...] After one of the group's shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack. [...] Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue: [...] "Within {{a few minutes of}} hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people I'd spent time with...He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> and a calm about him that were just riveting." [...] Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally.|$|E

500|$|After this incident, {{she falls}} ill and {{experiences}} nightmares, suggesting {{that when she}} underwent the rituals that made her the [...] "eaten one", some of her personality and her regard for life remained. She questions her faith (another theme {{that runs through the}} novel), and begins to develop <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> apart from it, helped in this process by Ged. She wrestles with her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing Tenar and stepping into the larger world of Earthsea. Afterwards she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes.

She's very competitive but does have <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative condition that gradually destroys the abilities to remember, reason, {{and engage in}} meaningful social interaction. AD Caregivers report that most of their stress comes from unsuccessful attempts to communicate with their patients.

2500|$|Kindred also {{portrays the}} {{historic}} exploitation of black female sexuality {{as a main}} site of the struggle between master and slave. Diana Paulin describes Rufus’s attempts to control Alice’s sexuality {{as a means to}} recuperate the power he had lost when Alice chose Isaac as her sexual partner. Compelled to submit her body to Rufus, Alice then divorces her desire from her sexuality to preserve <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> Similarly, Dana’s time traveling reconstructs her sexuality to fit the times. While in the present, Dana chooses her husband and enjoys sexual intercourse with him, in the past, her status as a black female requires that she subordinate her body to the desires of the master race for pleasure, breeding, and as sexual property. Thus, as Rufus grows into adulthood, he attempts to control Dana’s sexuality, ending with his attempt at rape to turn her into a replacement of Alice. Since Dana sees sexual domination as the ultimate form of subordination and dehumanization, her killing of Rufus serves to reject her identity as a female slave, distinguishing herself from those who did not have the power to say [...] "no." ...|$|E
