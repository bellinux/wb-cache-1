5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez {{in his other}} paintings. The main pigments used for this painting were lead white, <b>azurite</b> (for the skirt of the kneeling menina), vermilion and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as <b>azurite,</b> lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
25|$|Tsukiko: A female human Mystic Theurge {{imprisoned in}} Azure City for necromancy. She was {{released}} by the <b>Azurites</b> to help them during the battle against Xykon, but betrayed them and joined him instead. She has a necrophiliac attraction to Xykon, who rejects her advances.|$|R
50|$|Hinjo is a Lawful Good Paladin in Azure City's Sapphire Guard and {{the nephew}} and heir of Lord Shojo. After Shojo's death, Hinjo succeeded him as {{ruler of the}} <b>Azurites</b> and {{commander}} of the Sapphire Guard. Hinjo is first seen helping Miko escort the Order of the Stick to their trial in Azure City. He is much more easy going than fellow paladin Miko Miyazaki, generally getting along with the Order. Miko's disapproval of this caused him to mock her, telling the Order of the Stick that her attitude is the reason she is generally sent on the long missions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the reduced}} {{premises}} of the Museum, 740 mineral samples of unique beauty (representing 220 mineral species) {{are presented in}} showcases, classified either according to their chemical composition, e.g. sulphates, sulfides, oxides, silicates et al. (following the J. Dana system), or in cabinets comprising general samples or collections of major donors. The collection of the Museum, including more than 3,200 samples, continuously grows.The polymorphy, the particular crystallization, the iridescence and the amazing colours of the minerals surprise the visitors upon arrival. Aragonites, <b>azurites,</b> smithsonites from Lavrion are classified among the most beautiful of the world, whilst major Museums abroad would be proud to behold among their exhibits, samples of annabergite, spangolite, takovite, ktenasite, kapellasite, glaucocerinite, a.o., such as presented here.|$|R
5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and <b>azurite.</b> The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as <b>azurite,</b> malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the <b>azurite</b> in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E
25|$|The Order makes a brief {{diversion}} to Cliffport {{to confront}} the Linear Guild. After Nale frames Elan for the Linear Guild's crimes, Elan escapes from prison and reunites with Haley {{with the help of}} a dashing swordsman named Julio Scoundrel. Haley recovers her speech and confesses her love for Elan, who reciprocates. The Order returns to Azure City to ask Lord Shojo for further directions. Miko, who does not know about the plan to find the gates but does know about Xykon's army, overhears the conversation and jumps to the conclusion that both are in league with Xykon. She strikes her master down, and is immediately stripped of her paladin status by her gods and imprisoned. Xykon's hobgoblins attack the city the next day. The Order helps Shojo's heir, Hinjo, hold the city walls. Xykon attempts to circumvent the defenders, but Roy leaps up to the zombified dragon that Xykon is riding, and the two duel once more. Xykon overpowers Roy and sends him falling to his death. Xykon and Redcloak attempt to activate the gate hidden within the castle's throne room, but Miko, having escaped from prison, destroys the gate in an attempt to protect it. In the ensuing explosion, Miko is killed, and Xykon and Redcloak escape. The city falls to the hobgoblins. Haley and Belkar become separated from the party when they go to recover Roy's corpse, while the others sail away with Hinjo and the surviving <b>Azurites.</b> The printed book contains strips 302-484, plus extras.|$|R
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and <b>azurite.</b> Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E
25|$|Often {{painters}} or clients saved {{money by}} using less expensive blues, such as <b>azurite</b> smalt, or pigments made with indigo, but this sometimes caused problems. Pigments made from <b>azurite</b> were less expensive, but tended to turn dark and green with time. An {{example is the}} robe of the Virgin Mary in The Madonna Enthroned with Saints by Raphael in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The Virgin Mary's <b>azurite</b> blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black.|$|E
25|$|No {{evidence}} indicates Han blue {{being used for}} the warriors (<b>azurite</b> {{was used for the}} blue).|$|E

25|$|<b>Azurite</b> was {{the only}} natural blue pigment used in early China. Early China {{seems not to have}} used a natural purple pigment and was the first to develop a {{synthetic}} one.|$|E
25|$|The {{pigments}} {{employed by}} the artist are consistent with his other works. He painted the triptych with ochres, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, carmine and <b>azurite.</b> The sole rather unusual pigment is natural ultramarine used in small quantities in Virgin's robe.|$|E
25|$|Minerals such as gaspeite, hellyerite, otwayite, widgiemoolthalite {{and related}} hydrous nickel carbonates are {{diagnostic}} of nickel gossans, but are exceedingly rare. More usually, malachite, <b>azurite,</b> chalcocite and cobalt compounds are more persistent in boxworks and may provide diagnostic information.|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{turquoise}} promoted as Bisbee Blue was {{a by-product of}} the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and {{are to be found}} in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, aragonite, wulfenite, malachite, <b>azurite,</b> and galena.|$|E
25|$|Blue {{pigments}} {{were originally}} made from minerals such as lapis lazuli, cobalt and <b>azurite,</b> and blue dyes {{were made from}} plants; usually woad in Europe, and Indigofera tinctoria, or true indigo, in Asia and Africa. Today most blue pigments and dyes are made by a chemical process.|$|E
25|$|The Western Continent {{is split}} into an Elven {{forest in the}} north and an {{expansive}} desert in the south, separated from each other by the Goaway Mountains. Due to the continent's fragile political state, a large number of nations cluster {{around the edges of the}} desert. The Western Continent includes Vaarsuvius's homeland, and is close to an island with abandoned Elven ruins, where the <b>Azurite</b> fleet landed.|$|E
25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, chemists in Europe {{tried to}} {{discover}} a way to create synthetic blue pigments, avoiding the expense of importing and grinding lapis lazuli, <b>azurite</b> and other minerals. The Egyptians had created a synthetic colour, Egyptian blue, three thousand years BC, but the formula had been lost. The Chinese had also created synthetic pigments, but the formula was not known in the west.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} his meticulous {{painting}} technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments. He {{is best known for}} his frequent use of the very expensive ultramarine (The Milkmaid), and also lead-tin-yellow (A Lady Writing a Letter), madder lake (Christ in the House of Martha and Mary), and vermilion. He also painted with ochres, bone black and <b>azurite.</b> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in Woman Holding a Balance has been disproven by later pigment analysis.|$|E
25|$|Besides ultramarine, {{several other}} blues were {{widely used in}} the Middle Ages {{and later in the}} Renaissance. <b>Azurite,</b> a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a {{substitute}} for ultramarine. The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
25|$|Blue was a latecomer among colours used {{in art and}} decoration, as well as {{language}} and literature. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is {{probably due to the}} perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments. The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or <b>azurite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colour is {{the most}} obvious {{property}} of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except {{in the case of}} incandescence, which does not apply to minerals). Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic. Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and <b>azurite</b> (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{pigments}} {{were also}} traded over long distances. The {{only way to}} achieve a deep rich blue was by using a semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli, to produce a pigment known as ultramarine, and the best sources of lapis were remote. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck, working in the 15th century, did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings. To have one's portrait commissioned and painted with ultramarine blue was considered a great luxury. If a patron wanted blue, they were obliged to pay extra. When Van Eyck used lapis, he never blended it with other colors. Instead he applied it in pure form, almost as a decorative glaze. The prohibitive price of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments, both mineral (<b>azurite,</b> smalt) and biological (indigo).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} paints were red ochre, red lead, soot, calcium carbonate, and other earth colours, which were bound with fat and water. It also {{appears that the}} Vikings {{imported}} white lead, green malachite and blue <b>azurite</b> from Continental Europe. By using an electron microscope, chemists {{have been able to}} analyse traces of colours on runestones, and in one case, they discovered bright red vermilion, which was an imported luxury colour. However, the dominating colours were white and red lead. There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in Grettis saga, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a tree root and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in Egils saga where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with his own blood to see if the drink was poisoned.|$|E
25|$|The Triton figures {{began to}} be {{dismantled}} on 4 February 2017, and they were later sent in Florence to be cleaned. The concrete {{that was used to}} fill the brass figures has been removed. A steel structure has been built inside the figures so as to support the weight of the plate, and each figure will be covered in microcrystalline wax for protection and painted in <b>azurite</b> blue as was their original colour in 1959. The massive base of the fountain are being restored by the De Feo Restauri of Rome, a specialized company in restoration of monuments. A new plant room has been constructed, which is connected to the new pump room through a tunnel. Restoration works of the massive base of the fountain and its basins, as the electrical and mechanical installations, are expected to be ready {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
500|$|Pigments {{bound in}} glue had an optical quality that {{rendered}} [...] them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid. Unlike oil, which makes chalk appear translucent, chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white. Similarly, [...] more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium. [...] The whites are chalk in areas mixed with lead white, {{especially in the}} Magdalen's mantle and veil, Christ's shroud and the Virgin's veil. The artist used four blue pigments, an unusual number for paintings of the period, with indigo predominating. [...] As a plant-derived pigment, indigo it {{has a tendency to}} fade over time. <b>Azurite</b> and lead-white line the under-paint, while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead-tin yellow. The sky and Nicodemus' collar are painted with lighter and less intense <b>azurite,</b> while the Virgin's dress is <b>azurite</b> mixed with ultramarine and smalt, a blue ground-glass pigment. The Entombment is one of the earliest Western pictorial works of art in which the use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that the pigment was not invented during the sixteenth century, as had previously been believed.|$|E
500|$|Copper is {{produced}} in massive stars and {{is present in the}} Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). It occurs as native copper, in the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, in the copper carbonates <b>azurite</b> and malachite, and in the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite. [...] The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2cm.|$|E
500|$|In Ancient Egypt, {{green was}} {{the symbol of}} {{regeneration}} and rebirth, and of the crops {{made possible by the}} annual flooding of the Nile. [...] For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue <b>azurite.</b> To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant.|$|E
500|$|Individual {{items on}} display include {{coprolite}} from Mongolia, a 500-pound (227kg) {{piece of the}} lightweight volcanic rock pumice, obsidian and basalt. One specimen on display is a [...] wide plate with clear quartz crystals, epidote crystals measuring as large as 10cm and translucent calcite scalenohedrons, and comes from Green Monster Mountain on Alaska's Prince of Wales Island. The collection includes a cycad fossil dating from the Jurassic era that weighs 500 pounds (227kg). One meteorite is the Gibeon meteorite which weighs 210 pounds (95kg) and came from the African nation of Namibia. The world's largest known opal-filled thunderegg, weighing 1.75 tons (1600kg), is housed at the museum. The thunderegg is Oregon's state rock. Other items include <b>azurite,</b> Oregon sunstone, amber, copper crystals, zeolites, morganite, and agate among others.|$|E
500|$|Notwithstanding the {{excellent}} {{state of the}} wooden panel prior to its 1998 restoration, the painting was unevenly covered with layers of dust and yellowed varnish. This was particularly pronounced {{in the area of}} the sky, obscuring many fine details and altering this area's colouring. Once these layers were removed, it was discovered that the original grey-blue sky had been repainted with broad strokes of a deep blue dye mixed with a fixing agent. An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour, still discernible as a bright line above the horizon, was composed of <b>azurite,</b> while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true ultramarine or lapis lazuli. The ultramarine layer has been identified as prussian blue, a pigment which was favoured from the early 18th century onwards. Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts; the painting was [...] "varnished and somewhat restored" [...] by the painter Aline Bernard (1841–1910) in 1885, and a second time in 1907 by a Nils Janzon. The latter restoration was probably limited to the addition of a thick layer of varnish.|$|E
2500|$|Together {{with other}} components, copper(II) {{hydroxides}} are numerous. [...] Several copper(II)-containing minerals contain hydroxide. [...] Notable examples include <b>azurite,</b> malachite, antlerite, and brochantite. <b>Azurite</b> (2CuCO3·Cu(OH)2) and malachite (CuCO3·Cu(OH)2) are hydroxy-carbonates, whereas antlerite (CuSO4·2Cu(OH)2) and brochantite (CuSO4·3Cu(OH)2) are hydroxy-sulfates.|$|E
2500|$|Copper pigments: <b>Azurite,</b> Han purple, Han blue, Egyptian blue, Malachite, Paris green, Phthalocyanine Blue BN, Phthalocyanine Green G, {{verdigris}} ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{main body}} of copper ore formed between two {{geological}} faults in broken dolomite rocks. The ore body was up to 70metres(230ft) wide and mainly consisted of green malachite and blue <b>azurite</b> veins and nodules amongst the host rock. The malachite and <b>azurite</b> were formed from copper sulphide minerals, by {{a process known as}} [...] "secondary enrichment". This process took millions of years to convert the low grade copper sulphide ore, which was probably created 300 to 400 millions of years ago during the last period of vulcanism near Burra.|$|E
