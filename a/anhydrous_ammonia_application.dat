40|$|Many tons of crop {{residues}} and other low-quality forages are produced in Kansas each year. Use of these forages often {{is limited by}} their low nutrient content and poor digestibility. The process of applying anhydrous ammonia to low-quality forages enhances their feeding value by increasing crude protein content and dry matter digestibility. In the summer of 2012, the persistence of drought conditions throughout Kansas reduced forage supplies and resulted in {{a dramatic increase in}} forage prices. In an effort to aid livestock producers, the K-State Beef Extension Specialist Team, in conjunction with the Livestock Production Program Focus Team, conducted wheat straw ammoniation demonstrations at 6 locations across Kansas. The objectives of these demonstrations were to: (1) demonstrate the process of using anhydrous ammonia to treat low-quality roughages, and (2) determine if the recommended rate of 3 % <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>application</b> (dry weight) could be decreased as a cost-saving measure. The effects of two <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>application</b> rates (1. 5 and 3. 0 % dry matter weight of stack, equivalent to 30 or 60 lb anhydrous ammonia/ton of dry forage) on subsequent forage quality and digestibility were evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Anhydrous ammonia (AA) is an {{important}} N fertilizer in the U. S., and with large farming operations rapid application is needed. This study evaluated the impact of AA application timing and N rates when applied with a high speed low draft (HSLD) or a conventional till knife (CTKI) on corn (Zea Mays L.) production in no-tillage fields. The study was conducted at sites located in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas from 2007 to 2009. The experimental design was a split-plot factorial arrangement of application method, timing (fall; spring preplant, SP; and sidedress, SD), and five N rates. Fall AA application was least efficient (mean 55 kg N ha– 1 higher optimum N and 2 % lower grain yield, GY), with SP and SD equivalent. The HSLD was comparable to the CTKI with most applications, except when high N rates (180 and 225 kg N ha- 1) were applied SP. For these treatments AA injury reduced plant population (PP), early season growth, canopy NDVI, and GY. Seedling injury did not occur with any N rate or timing with the CTKI. Shallow AA placement at high speed with the HSLD can provide {{a viable alternative to}} traditional deeper knife injection when conditions are suitable for AA application and positioning avoids corn seedling injury. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>application</b> with the HSLD, however, should be avoided where high SP AA rates may be placed directly under future corn rows...|$|E

Development of improved management practices to increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) within agricultural fields is needed to improve crop production and reduce nitrogen (N) loss. Field studies planted to maize were conducted in 2005 and 2006 in the claypan region of north central and northeast Missouri {{to determine the effects of}} landscape position and soil depth to the claypan on crop growth and N uptake, and to examine the use of a variable-source N fertilizer application strategy to optimize crop N fertilizer use. Treatments at the northeast Missouri site consisted of a control and 168 kg N ha- 1 of urea, polymer-coated urea (PCU), a 50 % urea/ 50 % PCU mixture, or anhydrous ammonia applied in 457 m long strips that included variation in elevation and claypan depth. At the north central Missouri site, N fertilizer treatments of 168 kg N ha- 1 of urea or PCU were broadcast surface-applied within three different cropping/tillage systems and at different landscape positions representing the summit, sideslope and footslope positions in the field. PCU treatments showed a consistent 1505 to 1818 kg ha- 1 increase in grain yields in 2005 and 2006, respectively, in the low lying area, possibly due to the wetter conditions in the low-lying area affecting the fate of the applied N. Similarly, <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>application</b> resulted in a 1505 and 1630 kg ha- 1 yield increase in 2005 and 2006, respectively, in the low-lying area.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryDale A. BlasiDrought {{conditions}} {{in the past have}} created a shortage of prairie hay and other grass hays that are used as roughage sources for receiving and growing beef diets. Historically, wheat straw and other cereal crop residue has been discounted as a feedstuff due to its low nutrient content. Chemical methods, including ammonia application, can improve the feeding value of cereal crop residue while constraining costs. While there are studies that show the efficacy of utilizing ammoniated wheat straw in beef cow and maintenance diets, limited data are available characterizing the feeding value of ammoniated wheat straw in receiving and growing diets. The objective of these two studies were to evaluate cattle growth and diet digestibility for receiving and growing diets containing either wheat straw (STRW), anhydrous ammonia treated wheat straw (AMMN), or a prairie hay and alfalfa blend (CONT) at 30 % inclusion. Exp. 1 utilized 288 crossbred steers (271 kg) randomized to 8 pens per treatment and fed their respective test diets for 56 d and a common diet for 14 d to equalize gastrointestinal tract fill. No effect of straw ammoniation was observed on final bodyweight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), dry matter intake (DMI), or gain to feed (G:F) (P > 0. 31). The 56 -d BW, ADG, and G:F for CONT were significantly different from both STRW and AMMN (P 0. 57) although CONT differed significantly from both straw treatments in DM, OM, and ADF intake (P 0. 43), where as CONT and STRW were different (P 0. 32). Ruminal pH was not affected by <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>application</b> (P = 0. 32), but STRW and CONT were different (P < 0. 05). Fluid passage rate was not different among the three treatments (P = 0. 33). Wheat straw is a suitable replacement for ammoniated wheat straw at 30 % inclusion in receiving and growing diets that contain 40 % of dietary DM as wet corn gluten feed. Further research is necessary to determine the effect of varying levels of wheat straw and ammoniated wheat straw in conjunction with wet corn gluten feed and other by-product feeds in receiving and growing diets in order to capitalize on performance and efficiency gains while constraining costs...|$|E

It is a colourless gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperature, but under pressure readily changes into a liquid. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> has a high affinity for water. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> is a hygroscopic compound, this means it will seek moisture source {{that may be the}} body of the operator, which is composed of 90 percent water. When a human body is exposed to <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> the chemical freeze burns its way into the skin, eyes or lungs. This attraction places the eyes, lungs, and skin at greatest risk because of their high moisture content. Caustic burns result when the <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> dissolves into body tissue. Most deaths from <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> are caused by severe damage to the throat and lungs from a direct blast to the face. An additional concern is the low boiling point of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia.</b> The chemical freezes on contact at room temperature. It will cause burns similar to, but more severe than, those caused by dry ice. If exposed to severe cold flesh will become frozen.

In this study, CAN data was collected from the tractor diagnostic port during three field operations: <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH 3) <b>application,</b> field cultivation, and planting. Specifically, CAN messages corresponding to engine fuel use rate were filtered, decoded, and analyzed. High fuel use rates were recorded from the tractor when implements were engaged in the soil compared to when the implements were lifted {{out of the ground}} {{at the end of the}} passes or, when the tractor was turning and idling. Threshold fuel rates (TFR) in liter per hour per tool for each operation were established based on the draft force requirements of the implements to distinguish between working and dwell periods. Using the calculated TFRs of 2. 58 to 2. 64 Lh- 1 tool- 1, 0. 41 to 0. 50 Lh- 1 tool- 1 and 1. 46 to 1. 65 Lh- 1 row- 1, average field efficiencies (FE) of anhydrous NH 3 application, field cultivation and planting were determined to be 71 %, 71 % and 68 %, respectively. It was found that FE values for the planting operation were highly sensitive to variation in TFR when contrasted with anhydrous NH 3 application and field cultivation operations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> {{is one of}} {{the medium}} where the steel is easy to suffer stress {{corrosion}} cracking. Many stress corrosion crack accidents of ammonia storage tanks have been reported all over the world for recent years. 16 MnR low alloy steel with good composite mechanical properties is the most common used pressure vessel steel in China, it has better anticorrosion properties than the low alloy high strength steel, especially in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments. Many stress corrosion crack researches have been done for 16 MnR steel in wet hydrogen sulfide service for last decades, but less has been done in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments. Stress corrosion tests with eight constant strain pre-cracked specimen were carried out in this work. The pre-cracked specimen were loaded with loading bolts and put into the special ammonia storage tank for tests, they were taken out from the tank periodically to measure crack length. The stress corrosion crack growth rate and the threshold stress intensity factors KISCC of 16 MnR steel in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments were measured. Based on test results, the effects of environmental factors and steel strength on stress corrosion cracking of 16 MnR steel in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> service were analyzed. It could be concluded that specimen cracks of the 16 MnR steel in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments almost do not grow, threshold stress intensity factors KISCC are higher than 90 MPa m...|$|R
