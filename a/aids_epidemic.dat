5|$|Linda J. Laubenstein (May 21, 1947 – August 15, 1992) was a {{physician}} and early HIV/AIDS researcher. She {{was among the first}} doctors in the United States to recognize the <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic</b> of the early 1980s; she co-authored the first article linking AIDS with Kaposi's sarcoma.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Ryan White spoke {{before the}} President's Commission on the <b>AIDS</b> <b>Epidemic.</b> Ryan White told the {{commission}} of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school, but how education about the disease had made him welcome {{in the town of}} Cicero. Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero {{as an example of the}} power and importance of AIDS education.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the <b>AIDS</b> <b>Epidemic</b> is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic.</b> The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic</b> and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Víctor Vázquez Works are {{a complex}} amalgam of {{different}} medium. They are {{often difficult to}} decipher, yet invariably yield layers of profound meaning. His range is broad, and although he {{is best known for}} his photographs, he is essentially a maker of objects, video and installation. Vázquez art has been focused in exploring ideas related with the construction of knowledge, history, Memory, identity and migration. The intention has been to investigate and reflect on how the state imposes, reproduces and legitimizes acceptable social practices. His book [...] "The Realm of Waiting", published in 1990 and produced by the Humanities of Art and the Ponce Museum of Art in Puerto Rico was awarded best book of art of the year by the Puerto Rico Art Critic Association for been one of the first works of art that has dealt with the <b>Aid</b> <b>Epidemic</b> in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} effect of {{external}} infection sources on phase transitions in epidemic processes. In particular, we consider an epidemic spreading on a network via the SIS/SIR dynamics, which in addition is aided by external agents- sources unconstrained by the graph, but possessing a limited infection rate or virulence. Such a model captures many existing models of externally <b>aided</b> <b>epidemics,</b> and finds use in many settings- epidemiology, marketing and advertising, network robustness, etc. We provide a detailed characterization {{of the impact of}} external agents on epidemic thresholds. In particular, for the SIS model, we show that any external infection strategy with constant virulence either fails to significantly affect the lifetime of an epidemic, or at best, sustains the epidemic for a lifetime which is polynomial in the number of nodes. On the other hand, a random external-infection strategy, with rate increasing linearly in the number of infected nodes, succeeds under some conditions to sustain an exponential epidemic lifetime. We obtain similar sharp thresholds for the SIR model, and discuss the relevance of our results in a variety of settings. I...|$|R

25|$|Les Témoins (The Witnesses) {{deals with}} a group of friends and lovers confronting the <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic</b> in the 1980s. Mehdi, a French-Arab vice cop, is in an open {{marriage}} with Sarah, a writer of children's books who finds herself unable to bond with her newborn child. Sarah's best friend, Adrien, a middle aged doctor, is infatuated with Manu, a narcissistic young man, who has recently arrived in Paris from the South. There is also the story line of Julie, Manu's opera singer sister, and Sandra, Manu's hooker friend. The film is filled with color, life, and emotion until the <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic</b> disrupts the characters' lives.

We use the database from Bhargava and Docquier (2008) to explain physicians' brain drain and health foreign assistance from 1995 to 2003 using a bilateral gravity equation model. In the first time, we propose to investigate the direct and reverse impact of health assistance through Simultaneous Equation Model with Three-Stage Least Squares (3 SLS) methodology and highlight a significant negative effect of health foreign assistance on the medical brain drain whereas emigration rate of doctor increases the amount of health aid received by recipient countries.

40|$|Specific {{diagnosis}} of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae infection by the conventional culture and identification method usually requires 3 to 4 days. Since H. pleuropneumoniae may be disseminated from infected individuals during this period, {{this amount of}} time required for diagnosis may be too slow to <b>aid</b> in <b>epidemic</b> control. To obtain an earlier diagnosis, a coagglutination test was successfully used to detect serotype-specific antigens in lung extracts of infected pigs. A total of 19 lung tissues from experimentally infected pigs, 240 lung tissues from naturally infected pigs that died of pleuropneumonia, and 571 lung specimens from an apparently healthy pig population were examined for culture isolation {{as well as for}} antigen detection. The results showed that detection of antigens in lung tissues by the coagglutination test is an extremely rapid, simple, quite specific, and highly sensitive procedure for the {{diagnosis of}} H. pleuropneumoniae infection. Further, detection of antigens in lung tissues was found to be a much simpler and much more rapid method than culture isolation. The coagglutination test seems to be especially useful for detecting H. pleuropneumoniae in pigs exposed to chronic infection as well as those in which multiple serotypes are involved...|$|R

Since Salmonella may be disseminated from infected individuals during this period, {{this amount of}} time required for diagnosis may be too slow to <b>aid</b> in <b>epidemic</b> control. To obtain earlier diagnoses of salmonellosis, a coagglutination test was used for rapid, simplified detection of Salmonella oranienburg antigens in enrichment broth cultures of fecal specimens from infants involved in a nursery outbreak. Two selective enrichment broths were used, selenite cystine and dulcitol selenite. These were compared in parallel for efficiency by subculture on deoxycholate lactose sucrose, MacConkey, xylose lysine deoxycholate, and tryptic soy lactose teepol agars. These overnight enrichment broth cultures of stool specimens were also examined by a coagglutination slide test with stabilized protein A-containing staphylococci sensitized with antisera for Salmonella antigens C 1, E, and Vi. Of 113 diarrhea stool specimens tested, 86 were positive by conventional culture, 82 were positive by dulcitol selenite-coagglutination, and 55 were positive by selenite cystine-coagglutination. All these tests were negative on 50 stool specimens from infants in a noninfected nursery. Salmonellae were specifically detected in stool cultures within 20 h by the coagglutination technique. This early detection of Salmonella antigens provided a useful adjunct to culture for rapid {{diagnosis of}} salmonellosis...|$|R

40|$|Mastication is {{responsible}} for food breakdown {{with the aid of}} saliva in order to form a cohesive viscous mass, known as the bolus. This influences {{the rate at which the}} ingested food nutrients are later absorbed into the body, which needs to be controlled to <b>aid</b> in <b>epidemic</b> health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and dyspepsia. The aim of our work is to understand and improve food oral breakdown efficiency in both human and pet foods through developing multi-scale models of oral and gastric processing. The latter has been a challenging task and the available technology may be still immature, as foods usually exhibit a complex viscous, compliant, and tough mechanical behaviour. These are all addressed here through establishing a novel material model calibrated through experiments on starch-based food. It includes a new criterion for the onset of material stiffness degradation, a law for the evolution of degradation governed by the true material’s fracture toughness, and a constitutive stress-strain response, all three being a function of the stress state, i. e., compression, shear, and tension. The material model is used in a finite element analysis which reproduces accurately the food separation patterns under a large strain indentation test, which resembles the boundary conditions applied in chewing. The results lend weight to the new methodology as a powerful tool in understanding how different food structures breakdown and in optimising these structures via parametric analyses to satisfy specific chewing and digestion attributes...|$|R
