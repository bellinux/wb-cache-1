25|$|Due to the {{unprecedented}} {{scale of the}} destruction many of the country's leading banks, businesses, institutions and local administrations have offered considerable amounts of cash {{in order to help}} the people and businesses that suffered financially due to the fires. The government has created a special account in all Greek banks, where financial help in relief of the people affected by the fire {{from all over the world}} is accepted. Additionally, financial aid from the EU is expected. Forms of assistance in nature were also offered such as olive plants contributed by a Turkish municipality and businessmen to a collect already organized in Mytilene. The Greek Government plans to spend 645.7million euros ($946.7million) to restore and rehabilitate areas burnt by the fires. This amount will be provided by both the European Union and the Greek Government. The government has earmarked 150 million euros ($222 million) to help the people affected by the fire rebuild their homes and other buildings. The rapid nature of the response given in the form of a direct <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> free of red tape led to official claims in reverse a year after the calamity, as it has been the case for the residents of Ileia who were notified to return the aid payments. Opposition parties, in the meantime, accused the government of using the scheme to “buy” the votes of locals in the weeks before the Greek legislative election, 2007.|$|E

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of the previously proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>schemes</b> rely {{on the assumption that}} the aiding loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of the aiding loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at the aiding carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates the aided loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of the aiding signal and its effects on the performance of the aided loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of the aiding architecture is proposed to improve the quality of aiding estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing the proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R

Theoretical analyses about funding of early learning have mainly focused on vouchers. Yet, the available empirical evidence is more ambiguous {{about the effects}} of vouchers than {{about the effects of}} conditional cash transfers and financial incentives for pupils and teachers. Positive effects of financial incentives to pupils are not restricted to high ability pupils, as low ability students also seem to benefit. The evidence regarding the effects of subsidy forms is limited. The most prominent knowledge gaps regarding the effects of various financing schemes related to lifelong learning are the effects of vouchers in compulsory education; financial <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> for students; and entitlements and individual learning accounts.
