Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E

5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans.

5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat weaker than others in the series, with the change in tone dividing commentators.

5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> devastating wars, it lacked modern {{permanent}} fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned to the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship <b>and</b> <b>Constant,</b> who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, <b>and</b> <b>Constant</b> began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Orthogenesis was the {{hypothesis}} that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> unidirectional change.|$|E
5|$|Sophisticated {{techniques}} {{were used to}} delay {{the construction of the}} road. Sit-ins and site invasions were combined with sabotage to stop construction work temporarily. This led to large numbers of police <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> security patrols being employed to protect the construction sites, at great expense. By December 1994, the total cost of construction had been estimated at £6 million and rising by £500,000 every month.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
5|$|Though {{evolution}} is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely {{consistent with the}} modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes {{been referred to as}} orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.|$|E
5|$|Throughout mid-1835, {{both governments}} {{continued}} their practice of one-upmanship, <b>and</b> <b>constant</b> skirmishes and arrests occurred.
