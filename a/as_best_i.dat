In order to help Doyle with this, Paolini recorded the pronunciation of every invented name and word in Brisingr from a list over nine pages long. It was tricky even for Paolini {{to do this because}} he cannot [...] "roll [...] r's" [...] properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going [...] "largely by physical description. If there are specific details about the voices, I latch onto those <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can. But if a creature’s anatomical features are described, I try to imagine, for example, how the jaw might work...and then try and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal." ...|$|E

Till then I am content to wait, & work <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can for Ellan Vannin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 {{years his}} bandmates' senior, wrote songs expressing {{his desire for}} {{stability}} and individuality. [...] "I'm Not a Punk" [...] reflected his disinterest in {{being part of the}} anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: [...] "That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> could and I {{had a lot of fun}} doing that [...] It's like 'I'm Not a Punk'. I want to be my own person." [...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't live in a place where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality because my mother was an alcoholic, my parents are divorced, I just don't need that assault on my emotions and psyche." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one. And I say it to you <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can with a broken heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, {{longtime}} business {{correspondent and}} Moneyline host Lou Dobbs left CNN, reportedly due to heated clashes with the network's {{president at the}} time, Rick Kaplan, over programming priorities and questions about Kaplan's political objectivity. Dobbs returned the following year {{at the behest of}} CNN founder Ted Turner. From the time he rejoined the network, Dobbs had continuously railed against illegal immigration, offshoring, globalization and free trade in his [...] "War on the Middle Class" [...] and [...] "Broken Borders" [...] segments. Journalist Kurt Andersen in an article in New York criticized CNN for allowing Dobbs' program, [...] "Lou Dobbs Tonight", to become [...] "an amazingly tendentious nightly CNN 'news' program that goes well beyond the line-blurring that Fox [...] pioneered." [...] Dobbs announced his resignation from CNN on November 11, 2009 on what would be his last show for that network. He did not immediately explain the reason for his departure in his sign-off speech, but it was reported that CNN wanted him out and offered him $8 million to leave. Later upon questioning Dobbs discussed his exit, [...] "I tried to accommodate them <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> could, but I've said for many years now that neutrality is not part of my being." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{work had}} its genesis in a {{commission}} from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel {{to make an}} orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz's set of piano pieces, Iberia. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that the movements had already been orchestrated by Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, {{he said he would}} happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. However, Ravel changed his mind and decided initially to orchestrate one of his own works. He then changed his mind again and decided to write a completely new piece based on the musical form and Spanish dance called bolero. While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody with one finger to his friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying [...] "Don't you think this theme has an insistent quality? I'm going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can." [...] This piece was initially called Fandango, but its title was soon changed to [...] "Boléro". According to Idries Shah the main melody is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.|$|E
