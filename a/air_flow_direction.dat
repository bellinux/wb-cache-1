40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} determining {{the sensitivity of the}} main <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> in ventilation subnetworks to changes in aerodynamic resistance and air density in mine workings. The authors have developed formulae for determining the sensitivity of the main subnetwork <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> by establishing the degree of dependency of the air volume stream in a given working on the variations in resistance or air density of other workings of the network. They have been implemented in the Ventgraph mine ventilation network simulator. This software, widely used in Polish collieries, provides an extended possibility to predict the process of ventilation, air distribution and, in the case of underground fire, the spread of combustion gasses. The new method facilitates an assessment by mine ventilation services of the stability of ventilation systems in exploitation areas and determines the sensitivity of the main subnetwork <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> to changes in aerodynamic resistance and air density. Recently in some Polish collieries new longwalls are developed in seams located deeper than the bottom of the intake shaft. Such a solution is called “exploitation below the level of access” or “sublevel”. The new approach may be applied to such developments to assess the potential of changes in <b>direction</b> and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. In addition, an interpretation of the developed sensitivity indicator is presented. While analyzing air distributions for sublevel exploitation, the application of current numerical models for calculations of the distribution results in tangible benefits, such as the evaluation of the safety or risk levels for such exploitation. Application of the Ventgraph computer program, and particularly the module POŻAR (fire) with the newly developed options, allows for an additional approach to the sensitivity indicator in evaluating <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> safety levels for the risks present during exploitation below the level of the intake shaft.

Some basic {{characteristics}} of the snow cover duration in Romania, like the annual mean number and the variability index of days with snow cover in the cold season (December-March) from 1961 until 1990 are presented. In all the winter months, the largest values of the annual mean number have been recorded in the mountainous region of Romania, where the variability index is the smallest. For each month from December until March the “active ” snow cover areas have been determined by using the climatological frequencies of snow cover occurrence. The relationship between the snow cover duration and the temperature was analysed in the winter months (December-March). The correlation coefficients {{between the number of}} days with snow cover and monthly mean temperature are mostly negative over Romanian territory. The strongest correlations were found in January, February and March in the southern, eastern and central parts of Romania. The influence of the atmospheric circulation in the Atlantic-European region on the snow cover in Romania is studied by using the frequency of Hess-Brezowsky weather types. The westerly and northerly atmospheric circulation types have been taken into consideration and their association with snow cover duration in Romania was examined. Most of the correlations are negative for the westerly <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> and positive for the northerly ones...|$|R

However, the battery has a disadvantage that is the limited lifetime, adding an energy harvester to extend the lifetime is a good way. The thermoelectric generator {{is a good choice}} used for indoor condition since the temperature difference is easy to get in indoor condition, and a higher power density can be obtained, which can reach to 60 μW/cm 2 at 5 C gradient. The thermal energy generator (TEG) consists of the peltier element and the heat sink. The aim of this thesis is to model a TEG in COMSOL Multiphysics and study the characteristic of thermal energy harvesters and the influence of environment variables on thermal energy harvesters in indoor condition. The results of the thesis show that higher <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> speed at the same temperature gradient or bigger temperature difference at the same <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> speed both can lead to obtain better output performance of the TEG with 1. 6 ohm purely resistive load.

A traction motor is one of the core parts which compose the electric vehicle.

This structure has disadvantage for closed type and air cooling, so the cooling design of motor housing and internal in-wheel motor is important. In this study, thermo-flow analysis of the in-wheel motor for vehicles was performed in consideration of ram air effect. In order to improve cooling efficiency of the motor, we variously changed geometries of housing and internal shape.
