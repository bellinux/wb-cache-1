500|$|Cuba's burgeoning tourist {{industry}} {{of the late}} 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, [...] "In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner." [...] The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite {{the appeal of the}} [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the [...] "Buena Vista Social Club" [...] than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island, such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos, the creator of the genre. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.|$|E

2500|$|Today, many {{consider}} taolu {{to be one}} of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts. Traditionally, they played a smaller role in training for combat application, and took a back seat to sparring, drilling, and conditioning. Forms gradually build up a practitioner's flexibility, internal and external strength, speed and stamina, and they teach balance and coordination. Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types, using one or two hands. Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon. Forms are meant to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion, meditation, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Teachers are often heard to say [...] "train your form <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sparring and spar as if it were a form." ...|$|E

That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions. However, seeing the absolute within the relative does not extend to one's behavior towards others. Hakuin describes that at this point one [...] "is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land. Although he has a clear understanding of the Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas." ...|$|E

[...] together with Tom Wilkes's confronting poster image, The Concert for Bangla Desh received a preview screening on 22 March 1972 at New York's DeMille Theater before its official premiere the following day. John Lennon was among those attending the preview, along with wife Yoko Ono, although he left the cinema during Dylan's segment. The UK release was delayed until 27 July, however, preceded by a screening at the Rialto Cinema in central London. The Concert for Bangladesh was an instant commercial success internationally, breaking previous records for daily box-office takings in London. In his review for NME, John Pidgeon concluded: [...] "The film tries to be no more than a visual album, an aim which it pursues even as far as separating the 'tracks' with darkness, and in which it undisputedly succeeds." [...] Reviewing the 2005 reissue for BBC Online, Chris Jones described the concert as a [...] "masterclass" [...] in how to carry out a superstar charity benefit.|$|E

Lyrically, it sees Lo confessing her flaws before declaring [...] "On good days, I am charming as fuck!". [...] "The Way That I Am" [...] is a dubstep song filled with [...] "pain and passion" [...] as Lo sings in a soulful rasp and lyrically cries out to her partner to love her as she is; including flaws. [...] "Got Love" [...] is one of the albums [...] "pure" [...] pop moments, and contains an unwaveringly positive attitude. Lyrically, she rejoices exultant feelings of first falling in love as she sings [...] "Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond/Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops", and discusses the theme of immortality [...] "We live like legends now, know that would never die/Oh, we Got Love". Closing out the section is the power pop song [...] "Not on Drugs".

2500|$|Templer became GOC of the 1st Infantry Division, {{which had}} come {{under his command}} while he was GOC II Corps, on 31 July 1943. The division, with the 2nd, 3rd Infantry Brigades and the 24th Guards Brigade and {{supporting}} units, was based south of Tunis and had recently fought, with great distinction, in the final phases of the Tunisian Campaign, where it had gained three Victoria Crosses (VC) {{in the space of}} a week. The division was then training for future participation in the Italian Campaign. In late August General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied 15th Army Group, along with numerous and senior US and British generals, arrived to present the VC to Lance Corporal John Kenneally of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards. Shortly afterwards, the division was involved in a divisional parade, with General Dwight [...] "Ike" [...] Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre, reviewing the entire division. Templer himself wrote about the moment, saying [...] "I think it was the proudest moment of my life. In his address Ike said, 'When it gives me, your Supreme Commander and an American general, as proud to see you, the 1st Division of the British Army, on parade today <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the 1st Division of the American Army, then we are really getting somewhere!' It was a magnificent parade, and as far as I know, unique". Despite managing to concentrate the division and get it training in mountain warfare, Templer was not destined to lead the 1st Division into battle, although he was later to meet it again in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> playing Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players {{spent a lot of time}} last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E
