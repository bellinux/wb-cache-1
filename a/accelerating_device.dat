In an earlier paper, the empirical convergence speed of inclusion functions was defined and studied, and it was shown to be a good indicator of the inclusion precision. If the empirical convergence speed is analyzed for a given type of functions, then one can select the appropriate inclusion function to be used when dealing with those type of functions.

Having different types of hardware accelerators available, each with their own specific low-level APIs to program them, there is not yet a clear consensus on a standard way to retrieve information about the accelerator’s performance. To improve this scenario, OMPT is a novel performance monitoring interface that is being considered for integration into the OpenMP standard. OMPT allows analysis tools to monitor the execution of parallel OpenMP applications by providing detailed information about the activity of the runtime through a standard API. For <b>accelerated</b> <b>devices,</b> OMPT also facilitates the exchange of performance information between the runtime and the analysis tool.
