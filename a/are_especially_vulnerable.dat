5|$|The golden swallow is {{victim to}} various {{mammalian}} nest predators, including the introduced Indian mongoose, feral cats, and multiple species of rats. These predators {{are thought to}} be linked to the extinction of the nominate subspecies. Nests on or near the ground in mines <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> if the adult is absent.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E

5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to human activities, and {{eight of the}} 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its limited}} range, this snail <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to natural or human-caused {{incidents}} that could destroy most, or even all, of its populations.|$|R
50|$|The {{thyroid gland}} <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to x-ray exposure. Care {{should be taken}} to place a lead apron overthe thyroid gland before taking dental radiographs. Aprons used for dental imaging should include thyroid collars.|$|R
30|$|Long-running {{applications}} that require many resources and must produce precise results {{are likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to failures [20]. Sander et al. [21] summarized the networking issues identified on grid environments, a potential source of faults when transporting large datasets.|$|R
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E
25|$|Globally, infants are a {{population}} that <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to foodborne disease. The World Health Organization has issued recommendations for the preparation, use and storage of prepared formulas. Breastfeeding remains the best preventative measure for protection of foodborne infections in infants.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects may}} be {{indirectly}} related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or {{high concentration of}} gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.|$|E
25|$|However, {{systematic}} sampling <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to periodicities in the list. If periodicity is {{present and the}} period is a multiple or factor of the interval used, the sample <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> likely to <b>be</b> unrepresentative of the overall population, making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling.|$|R
50|$|Ghosting {{has been}} {{considered}} as being a type of behaviour that can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> traumatic for those on the receiving end, due to the psychological effects of ostracism and rejection and those with low self-esteem can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to negative emotional and psychological consequences {{as a result of}} it.|$|R
50|$|By the 2080s, {{millions}} of people would experience floods every year due to sea level rise. The numbers affected were projected to be largest in the densely populated and low-lying mega-deltas of Asia and Africa; and smaller islands were judged to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|R
25|$|Erosion is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} which can be aggravated by manmade situations increasing risks produced by landslides, flood, avalanches, mudfloods…etc. Erosion impact are usually severe on dry areas, {{due to lack of}} vegetation. In Colombia, areas such as Cúcuta, Villa de Leyva, Tatacoa desert in Huila, Chicamocha canyon, La Guajira, Valle de Tenza, Valle Medio del Patía <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the intensity of ground shaking during earthquakes and the associated damage to structures are significantly influenced by local geologic and soil conditions. Unconsolidated sediments are found to amplify ground motion during earthquakes and are hence more prone to earthquake damage than ground with hard strata. Modern cities built on soft sediments <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to damage caused by amplified ground motions.|$|E
25|$|Time. A {{key factor}} in guerrilla {{strategy}} is a drawn-out, protracted conflict that wears down {{the will of the}} opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force must allow enough time to get the job done. Impatient demands for victory centered around short-term electoral cycles play {{into the hands of the}} guerrillas, though it is equally important to recognize when a cause is lost and the guerrillas have won.|$|E
50|$|Poverty is {{widespread}} in Malawi, with 50% {{of its population}} living under the poverty line of $2/day according to the World Bank. The rural poor <b>were</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to the food crisis {{because they could not}} afford to buy food when their harvests failed.|$|R
25|$|These {{processes}} {{are the same}} for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the ischemic cascade. However, brain tissue <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to ischemia since it has a little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on aerobic metabolism, unlike most other organs.|$|R
50|$|Since Prescott {{is located}} only {{a mile from}} the town of Ogdensburg, New York, it <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to {{military}} action by the United States Army.

25|$|Some groups <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> {{to human}} rights abuses {{collateral}} to drug law enforcement. Specifically in Northern Border states that have seen elevated levels of drug-related violence, human rights violations of injection drug users (IDUs) and sex workers by law enforcement personnel include physical and sexual violence, extortion, and targeting for accessing or possession of injection equipment or practicing sex work, although these activities are legal. Such targeting is especially deleterious because members of these marginalized communities often lack the resources and social or political capital to vindicate their rights.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} types of memory {{have been identified in}} humans, such as declarative memory (including episodic memory and semantic memory), working memory, spatial memory, and procedural memory. Studies done, have found that memory functions, more specifically those associated with the medial temporal lobe <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to age-related decline. A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as histological, structural imaging, functional imaging, and receptor binding have supplied converging evidence that the frontal lobes and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{there are}} seven species of {{introduced}} mammals and four introduced bird species within the park. Foxes and feral dogs are a threat to koalas, and Feral cats and foxes are a real danger to many threatened species within the Upland Swamp region. Bats <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to feral cat predators. Feral cats, foxes and mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) have been listed as creating key threatening processes (predation, competition and vegetation alteration) under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (NSW). Chytrid fungus infecting frogs and feral deer causing environmental degradation (such as trampling and accelerating erosion), are also considered to cause threatening processes.|$|E

25|$|Many of the conifer species {{cultivated}} face infestations {{and death}} from such pests as the balsam woolly adelgid, other adelgids and aphids. Invasive insect species, {{such as the}} pine shoot beetle and the gypsy moth, also threaten Christmas tree crops. Christmas trees are also vulnerable to fungal pathogens, resulting in such illnesses as root rot, and, in California, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia sudden oak death. Douglas-fir trees <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to infections from plant pathogens such as R. pseudotsugae and Rhabdocline weirii; R. weirii affects only Douglas-fir trees. The pathogen often makes Douglas-fir trees unsaleable as Christmas trees and heavily affects the Christmas tree farming industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{elderly and}} those with a {{weakened}} immune system <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to contracting cellulitis. Diabetics {{are more susceptible to}} cellulitis than the general population because of impairment of the immune system; they are especially prone to cellulitis in the feet, because the disease causes impairment of blood circulation in the legs, leading to diabetic foot or foot ulcers. Poor control of blood glucose levels allows bacteria to grow more rapidly in the affected tissue, and facilitates rapid progression if the infection enters the bloodstream. Neural degeneration in diabetes means these ulcers may not be painful, thus often become infected. Those who have suffered poliomyelitis are also prone because of circulatory problems, especially in the legs.|$|E
25|$|Children <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> {{to these}} {{developmental}} and psychological consequences of trafficking {{due to their}} age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy {{physical and mental health}} of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Victims experience severe trauma on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of self-concept, self-worth, biological integrity, and cognitive functioning. Children who grow up in constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders. Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.|$|E
50|$|The portion from Jianxiang to Siyuan Bridge, in both directions, <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to horrible traffic jams. The {{remainder}} of the northern and eastern portions are also vulnerable. Apart from the Fengtai area, the {{remainder of}} the 4th Ring Road has a lesser risk of being clogged up by traffic jams.|$|R
50|$|With {{very high}} confidence, IPCC (2007) {{projected}} {{that by the}} 2080s, many millions more people would experience floods every year due to sea level rise.The numbers affected were projected to be largest in the densely populated and low-lying megadeltas of Asia and Africa.
