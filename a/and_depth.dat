5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E

50|$|Roughing {{cuts are}} used to remove large amount of {{material}} from the starting workpart as rapidly as possible, i.e. with a large Material Removal Rate (MRR), {{in order to produce}} a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent finishing operation.Finishing cuts {{are used to}} complete the part and achieve the final dimension, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two finishing cuts. Roughing operations are done at high feeds <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> - feeds of 0.4-1.25 mm/rev (0.015-0.050 in/rev) <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> of 2.5-20 mm (0.100-0.750 in) are typical, but actual values depend on the workpiece materials. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> - feeds of 0.0125-0.04 mm/rev (0.0005-0.0015 in/rev) <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> of 0.75-2.0 mm (0.030-0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than in finishing.|$|R

5|$|The overall shell {{morphology}} of L.gigas is {{not solely}} {{determined by the}} animal's genes; environmental conditions such as location, diet, temperature <b>and</b> <b>depth,</b> and biological interactions such as predation, can greatly affect it.

5|$|Black & White {{received}} universal acclaim on release; reviewers {{praised the}} artificial intelligence, uniqueness, <b>and</b> <b>depth,</b> although the system requirements and bugs were criticised. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Guinness World Record for {{the complexity of}} the artificial intelligence, selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered it to have been over-rated at the time. An expansion, , and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.|$|E

In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> charges.|$|E

This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
