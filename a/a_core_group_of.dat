5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the 2013 season, the coach met with Osvaldo Alonso, Clint Dempsey, and Evans since they were <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> players. The group agreed on the aforementioned changes to the team. Starting striker Eddie Johnson was later traded while a new central defender, winger, midfielder, goalkeeper, and depth at the forward position were brought in. The team played 2014 with Dempsey and Obafemi Martins playing more through the middle as the Sounders won the US Open Cup and the Supporters Shield.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. {{referred}} to above, {{which was the}} largest yet to use purely molecular data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, {{with the exception of}} stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent).|$|E

5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well as for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E
5|$|Site {{construction}} of the facility began on 1 June 2005 following environmental approval from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Safety and security was then put in place on the site. During its peak of construction activities {{in the summer of}} 2006, more than 500 workers were involved both at the Sliding Centre and at the Whistler Nordic Venue (now Whistler Olympic Park). <b>A</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 60 workers was involved with track construction from June 2005 to December 2007. Basic track construction was completed in November 2007 though fit-out and testing continued into 2008.|$|E
5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices. The LSSAH {{had some of}} the strictest entry requirements. The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men be in good physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have a confirmed ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{unprecedented}} Red Supergiant (RSG) population of a massive young cluster, located {{at the base of}} the Scutum-Crux Galactic arm. We identify candidate cluster RSGs based on 2 MASS photometry and medium resolution spectroscopy. With follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy, we use CO-bandhead equivalent width and high-precision radial velocity measurements to identify <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> 26 physically-associated RSGs [...] the largest such cluster known to-date. Using the stars' velocity dispersion, and their inferred luminosities in conjuction with evolutionary models, we argue that the cluster has an initial mass of ∼ 40, 000, and is therefore among the most massive in the galaxy. Further, the cluster is only a few hundred parsecs away from the cluster of 14 RSGs recently reported by Figer et al (2006). These two RSG clusters represent 20...|$|R
25|$|As a concept, open-endedness exists along a {{continuum}} {{dependent upon the}} duration of the group (Gitterman, 1989; Schopler and Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 2006). When membership is open but the group is of a long duration <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> members is likely to emerge (Schopler and Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 1999, 2006). When this occurs the core group assumes responsibilities for indoctrinating new members (Gitterman, 1989; Schopler & Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 1999).|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} support for an open source project varies highly. The {{available}} support for open source software is predominantly self-motivated discussions found on the Internet, sometimes moderated by <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> contributors. The amount of documentation or guides for an open source project also varies highly. More popular or company-backed projects often have more detailed and maintained documentation. However, as open source projects are regularly changing, documentation can easily fall out of date.|$|E
25|$|Critical common-sensism, {{treated by}} Peirce as a {{consequence}} of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{doctrines of}} the Source Family were kept secret; however, they {{generally}} adopted {{a way of}} life that promoted natural health, organic vegetarian diets, communal living and utopian ideals.

25|$|The High German {{consonant}} shift altered {{a number}} of consonants in the southern German dialects – and thus also in modern Standard German, Yiddish, and Luxembourgish – and so explains why many German words have different consonants from the obviously related words in English, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages.

Alternatively, it may encompass other phonological changes {{that took place in the}} same period.|$|E
