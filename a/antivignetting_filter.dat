40|$|Large Format Camera (LFC) was {{developed}} by NASA to produce high resolution stereo photographs from space with maximum photogrammetric fidelity. The camera has a 30. 5 cm focal length lens and an f/ 6. 0 aperture. The optics are corrected to permit operation with black and white (b/w), natural color (col) and color infrared (cir) film. Interchangeable minus-haze and minus-blue filters are located near the aperture stop, and an <b>antivignetting</b> <b>filter</b> is provided on the front element of the lens. The field-of-view of the LFC along track is 73. 7 degrees (ratio 1. 5 x H) and across track is 41. 1 degrees (ratio 0. 75 x H). The frame format of the LFC is 23 x 46 cm with the long dimension {{in the direction of}} flight. The camera can be operated to produce 10, 60, 70, or 80 percent forward overlap for stereoscopic coverage. With 80 percent forward overlap, the stereo model base height ratio is 0. 3 for successive frames and 1. 2 if every fourth frame is used. The LFC magazine has a capacity of 2400 frames. Two horizon-looking stellar cameras, one directed 45 degrees forward and the other 45 degrees aft were used to photograph the star field in synchronism with exposures of the LFC. Post flight mensuration and calculation of the stellar photographs will provide altitude information for the LFC...|$|E
