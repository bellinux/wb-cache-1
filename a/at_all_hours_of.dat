The Rainbo Arena was also a training rink for several Olympic figure skaters, and {{during much of the}} 1960s was the only indoor hockey rink in the Chicago area open to the public.

25|$|Chinese {{students}} from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately {{in their own}} dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, assuming they will be a roommate {{and participate in the}} foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency attitudes are laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes hallways (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors—including mainlanders—of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests {{may or may not be}} allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm. Electricity is usually available <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the day.|$|E

None of the other agencies that serve San Francisco with public transit (Muni, AC Transit, SamTrans) have improved bicycle access since the bicycle plan was adopted.

500|$|Ham Mills was {{a site of}} milling {{activity}} from mediaeval times until about 1914. The mill was situated on {{an island in the}} middle of the river, with a weir and bypass channel to the north and the lock channel to the south. The Conservators were required to light the area after a boatman fell into the river and drowned while attempting to use the lock after dark in March 1826. The coroner who instructed that the lighting should be installed noted that [...] "boats were passing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the night." [...] Water levels in the river fell as more water was extracted further upstream, and by the 1890s the waterwheels were assisted by a steam-driven turbine which the miller installed. Milling ceased in 1914, when the boiler which supplied the steam was removed by the War Department, so that it could be fitted into a minesweeper. A surviving mill house which dates from the early 19th century has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.|$|E

His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by [...] "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the [...] "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was [...] "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".|$|E

30|$|We also {{estimate}} unconditional quantile regressions (UQR). This method, {{developed by}} Firpo et al. (2009), {{allows us to}} test whether the effect of BMI varies across the unconditional <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work distribution. 8 In addition, UQR can help determine whether the positive association between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work is related to a health insurance motive. If that were the case, {{we are likely to}} see a stronger association for people who are right below the cutoff of health insurance eligibility (which is about 30  h/week or about 1500  h/year).

The portier was a tow-headed young German, twenty-two or three years old; and it had been for some time apparent to me that he did not enjoy being hammered out of his sleep, nights, to let me in.

40|$|American pikas {{are small}} mammals related to rabbits. They are often {{described}} as being diurnal (active during the day), with peak activity times {{in the morning and}} evening. We explored the daily activity times of pikas by analyzing a previously collected set of images from motion-activated cameras. As part of another study, two cameras were set in the field for several weeks in summer 2011 and 2012 to detect pika movement. Each image had a time stamp when it was taken. We combined the data from all the dates that cameras were in the field, then counted the number of pika images taken in hourly intervals for the 24 -hour cycle. Since motion-sensitive cameras take repeated images if an animal triggers them, we only used images that were at least 10 minutes apart. We analyzed the time of 57 different images, representing above-ground activity of one to three pikas. The pikas at this location were most active in the mid-morning hours, and again late evening. They showed another spike of activity around midnight. The peak in activity at mid-morning and late evening hours is consistent with previous studies of pikas. What was surprising was the midnight activity, and that we detected some activity <b>at</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the day and night. Knowing when pikas are most active will be useful for climate change studies, because pikas are sensitive to hot weather and would be expected to change their activity patterns in response to warmer climates...|$|R
