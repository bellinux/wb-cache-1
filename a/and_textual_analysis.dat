25|$|Powell was {{commissioned}} on the General List in 1940 but almost immediately {{transferred to the}} Intelligence Corps. He was soon promoted to captain and posted as GSO3 (Intelligence) to the 1st (later 9th) Armoured Division. During this time he taught himself the Portuguese language to read the poet Camões in the original; as insufficient Russian-speaking officers were available at the War Office, {{his knowledge of the}} Russian language <b>and</b> <b>textual</b> <b>analysis</b> skills were used to translate a Russian parachute training manual—a task he completed after 11pm in addition to his normal duties, deducing the meaning of many technical terms from the context; he was convinced that the Soviet Union must eventually enter the war on the Allied side. On one occasion, he was arrested as a suspected German spy for singing the Horst-Wessel-Lied. He was sent to the Staff College at Camberley.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{well-known}} postmodernist concerns is [...] "deconstruction," [...] a theory for philosophy, literary criticism, <b>and</b> <b>textual</b> <b>analysis</b> developed by Jacques Derrida. The notion of a [...] "deconstructive" [...] approach implies an analysis that questions the already evident understanding of a text in terms of presuppositions, ideological underpinnings, hierarchical values, and frames of reference. A deconstructive approach further depends on the techniques of close reading without reference to cultural, ideological, moral opinions or information derived from an authority over the text such as the author. At the same time Derrida famously writes: [...] "Il n'y a pas d'hors-texte (there {{is no such thing}} as outside-of-the-text)." [...] Derrida implies that the world follows the grammar of a text undergoing its own deconstruction. Derrida's method frequently involves recognizing and spelling out the different, yet similar interpretations of the meaning of a given text and the problematic implications of binary oppositions within the meaning of a text. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement called deconstructivism among architects, characterized by the intentional fragmentation, distortion, and dislocation of architectural elements in designing a building. Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenmann in Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman.|$|E
