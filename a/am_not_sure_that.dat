As Hatnuah chairwoman in 2013, she wrote: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> today I would once again privatize Israel Chemicals and the natural resources at the Dead Sea." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that global—that a trend of global warming exists. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{it is fair to say}} that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change.|$|E
2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them." [...] He would accept the Constitution, [...] "because I expect no better and because I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not the}} best".|$|E

I am all {{the writers}} that I have read, {{all the people}} that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors." [...] As a young man, he visited the frontier pampas which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him [...] "to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan," [...] in the way of Henry and William James. Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and Death and the Compass. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes to be [...] "the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time." ...|$|E
