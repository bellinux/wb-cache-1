40|$|Background: Keloids {{of the ear}} {{are common}} problems. Various {{treatment}} modalities are available {{for the treatment of}} ear keloids. Surgical excision with intralesional steroid injection along with compression therapy has the least recurrence rate. Various types of devices are available for pressure therapy. Pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> these devices is uncontrolled and is associated with the risk of pressure necrosis. We describe here a simple and easy to use device to measure pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> these clips for better outcome. Objectives: To devise a simple method to measure the pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> various pressure clips used in ear keloid pressure therapy. Materials and Methods: By using a force sensitive resistor (FSR), the pressure applied gets converted into voltage using electrical wires, resistors, capacitors, converter, amplifier, diode, nine-volt (9 V) cadmium battery and the voltage is measured using a multimeter. The measured voltage is then converted into pressure using pressure voltage graph that depicts the actual pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> the pressure clip. Results: The pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> different clips was variable. The spring clips were adjustable by slight variation in the design whereas the pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> binder clips and magnet discs was not adjustable. Conclusion: The uncontrolled/suboptimal pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> certain pressure clips can be monitored to provide optimal pressure therapy in ear keloid for better outcome...|$|R

Studies on soil-dwelling predatory arthropods {{were carried out}} in lowland areas of South Sumatra, with objectives to analyze the species diversity and abundance of the predatoryarthropods inhabiting fields <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> synthetic insecticide, bioinsecticide, and without insecticide application. The predatory arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps. Indices of diversity and community similarities were applied to analyze the data. Results indicated that the arthropods inhabiting field without insecticide application had the highest diversity and abundance compared to other treatments. Predatory community similarities between those on the field without insecticide application and <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> bioinsecticide were higher compared to the fields <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> synthetic insecticide...|$|R
