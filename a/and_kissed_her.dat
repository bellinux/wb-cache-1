5|$|Rena Mero {{returned}} to the WWF, which {{is now known as}} World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on the April 3, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, reprising her role as Sable. Sable continued portraying a villainess and spent several months in a storyline with new Playboy covergirl Torrie Wilson. During their angle, the evil Sable followed Wilson down to her matches, talked with her backstage, and on one occasion, she left Wilson in a tag match alone to fend for herself. Sable eventually challenged Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at Judgment Day. After Sable got the bigger applause, Wilson removed her chaddi to reveal an even smaller bikini underneath, and Special Guest Referee Tazz declared Wilson the winner. After the match, Wilson went up to Sable <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> before exiting the ring. Sable then had an altercation with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of SmackDown!, as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.|$|E
5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her.</b> Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E
25|$|Judy Lewis was Gable's {{only child}} born {{while he was}} alive. Nineteen months after the birth, Young claimed to have adopted Judy. The girl grew up {{resembling}} Gable very much, including having large ears that stuck out. She went by the name Judy Lewis after her mother married Tom Lewis when Judy was four years old. According to Lewis, Gable visited her home once, when she was 15, asked about her life, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> on her forehead upon leaving. He did not tell {{her that he was}} her biological father. Neither Gable nor Young would ever publicly acknowledge the truth about their daughter, but most in Hollywood and some in the general public believed Gable was her father, due, in part, to their strong resemblance and the timing of her birth.|$|E

25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her.</b> She related that at the time she thought she might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E

She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her.</b> That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Beiste storyline was {{met with}} criticism. Reiter {{questioned}} why Beiste was made to look to {{high school students to}} [...] "gauge her own desirability", an element she found [...] "hazy and creepy". Poniewozik criticized the depiction of Beiste as an object of pity, and felt that Will's behavior was worse than the students' when he acted with [...] "amazing condescension" [...] <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her.</b> Both Poniewozik and Semigran disliked the way viewers were made complicit in Beiste's humiliation by being invited to laugh at her expense, and Holmes criticized Glee for denying Beiste dignity, with the observation that such a plot would never have been given to Kurt. VanDerWerff commented negatively on the way Glee plays up Beiste's [...] "masculine nature" [...] while simultaneously lecturing viewers against mocking her. He called the kiss [...] "somehow both heartfelt and completely horrifying". Canning praised Jones in her [...] "best performance this season", as well as Beiste's [...] "raw and real" [...] confession to Will.|$|E

As {{a result of that}} gesture, a local court ordered the arrest of Gere and Shetty, finding them in violation of public obscenity laws. Gere has said the controversy was [...] "manufactured by a small hard-line political party." [...] About a month later, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, described the case as [...] "frivolous" [...] and believed that such complaints (against celebrities) were filed for [...] "cheap publicity" [...] and have brought a bad name to the country. They ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country.|$|E

[...] The directors of the Odéon next decided to stage Ruy Blas, a play written by Victor Hugo in 1838, with Bernhardt {{playing the role of}} the Queen of Spain.

The play premiered on 16 January 1872.

He says that on that day he was on the subway to Brooklyn to visit his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield. He came out of the subway at Times Square, where people were celebrating in the streets. Excited that his brother, who was being held by the Japanese as a prisoner of war, would be released, McDuffie began hollering and jumping up and down. A nurse saw him, and opened her arms to him.
