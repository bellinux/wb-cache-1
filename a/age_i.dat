25|$|The {{origins of}} Judaism {{lie in the}} Bronze Age polytheistic Ancient Semitic religions, {{specifically}} Canaanite religion, a syncretization with elements of Babylonian religion and of the worship of Yahweh reflected in the early prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible. During the Iron <b>Age</b> <b>I,</b> the Israelite religion became distinct from other Canaanite religions due to the unique monolatristic (proto-monotheistic) worship of Yahweh.|$|E

25|$|Saul’s kingdom was {{not very}} large. It {{probably}} included Mt. Ephraim, Benjamin and Gilead. He also exerted some influence in the northern mountains in Judah and beyond the Jezreel Valley. His capital {{appears to have been}} basically a military camp near Gibeah. Archeology seems to confirm that until about 1000 BCE, the end of Iron <b>Age</b> <b>I,</b> Israelite society was essentially a society of farmers and stockbreeders without any truly centralized organization and administration.|$|E
25|$|The archaeological record {{indicates}} that the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged in the Early Iron Age (Iron <b>Age</b> <b>I,</b> 1200–1000 BCE) from the Canaanite city-state culture of the Late Bronze Age, {{at the same time}} and in the same circumstances as the neighbouring states of Edom, Moab, Aram, and the Philistinian and Phoenician city-states. The oldest Hebrew text ever found was discovered at the ancient Israelite settlement, Elah Fortress, which dates to between 1050 and 970 BCE.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} the oldest {{settlement}} {{at the site of}} modern Acre were found at the tell (archaeological mound) known as Tel Akko in Hebrew and Tell el-Fukhar in Arabic, and date to the Early Bronze <b>Age</b> <b>I</b> (c. 3500-3050 BCE); however, this farming community endured only for a couple of centuries, after which the site was abandoned, possibly after being inundated by the rising sea waters, only to be resettled as an urban centre during the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000-1550 BCE). Acre was inhabited from then on continuously, although being subject to conquest and destruction several times, most recently in 1291 when the Mamluks razed the city once they took it from the Crusaders; in the 14th and into the 15th centuries it was not more than a large village. Acre is therefore counted among the oldest continuously inhabited sites in the region.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the major}} {{excavations}} by Kempinski {{and the ongoing}} Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, two separate minor excavations were conducted by Dina Shalem and Howard Smithline. In 1999, Shalem headed up a salvage excavation ahead of a construction project on the Mandate period road running through the tel. Her team worked in Area D and came across EB architecture, {{as well as some}} Chalcolithic sherds and a possible surface from that period. In 2004, the Israeli telecommunications company, Cellcom, was laying down new telephone cable near Area E, and Smithline was asked to conduct a salvage excavation before the work started. He used {{this as an opportunity to}} investigate further the Iron Age aspects of the site. His team did not make any new discoveries, but did add to the collection of Iron <b>Age</b> <b>I</b> (1,200–1,000 BC) and Iron Age II (1,000–586 BC) pottery from the site.|$|E

[...] During his youth, Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music, listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Boz Scaggs. He is inspired by electronic music, including Depeche Mode and The Cure. His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan, as well as heavy metal groups Mountain, Iron Maiden and Kiss. According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions. He explained that he [...] "never focused on the drummers," [...] saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer.|$|E
500|$|The Kingdom of Qatna was {{established}} around 2000 BC. At {{the beginning of}} the Middle Bronze <b>Age</b> <b>I,</b> the city expanded and covered an area of [...] This growth reduced the number of the small settlements as people were drawn into the expanded metropolis. It is probable that the earliest mention of [...] "Qatna" [...] by this name dates to the same period. According to Thomas Schneider, a city named Qedem, mentioned in a controversial passage in the Story of Sinuhe dating to {{the beginning of the}} Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt (early 20th century BC), is most probably to be identified with Qatna. Qedem in the Egyptian text is written [...] "Qdm", and, in Egyptian, Qatna is written as [...] "Qdn". If Schneider's interpretation is correct, then this is the first known written mention of the city. The text also mentions that the title of the ruler was Mekim (or Mekum), a royal title known from Ebla. The theory of Schneider is debated: in Sinuhe's story, the protagonist turned back to Qedem after reaching Byblos; Joachim Friedrich Quack pointed out that the Egyptian verb [...] "ḥs ̯i" [...] used in the text was known to indicate that a certain expedition had reached its final destination and was now returning to Egypt, indicating that Qedem was south of Byblos, while Qatna is to the north of Byblos.|$|E
500|$|Deir Ghassaneh {{has been}} {{identified}} as the ancient Saredah (also spelled Zeredah), hometown of Jeroboam. According to some sources, it was settled by the Ghassanids, an Arab Christian tribal confederation, after it was abandoned by the Israelites. English orientalist Edward Henry Palmer (1840–1882) thought the name meant [...] "The monastery of the Ghassaneh [...] ". However, according to Moshe Sharon (b. 1937), Israeli professor of Islamic history and civilisation, this claim has been dismissed by a number of researchers since the Ghassanids did not have a history of settlement in Samaria, the modern-day northern West Bank. Sharon suggests that the name of the village is related to the Arabic word ghassaneh which means [...] "very handsome" [...] or suggests [...] "youth and beauty". Byzantine ceramics have been found in Deir Ghassaneh, and {{on the north side of}} Beit Rima. In addition, small fragments of a marble column were found in Deir Ghassaneh. In Beit Rima, sherds from the Iron <b>Age</b> <b>I</b> and IA II, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Crusader/Ayyubid, Mamluk and Early Ottoman remains have been found. In the compendium of Jewish oral law known as the Mishnah (compiled in 189 CE), Beit Rima is mentioned as a place where they formerly produced a high-quality grape wine, and which was brought as an oblation to the Temple in Jerusalem. In Deir Ghassaneh, sherds from all of the same periods, except Persian, have also been found.|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt {{supported}} increased {{roles for}} women and African-Americans in the war effort, and began to advocate for women to be given factory jobs a year before it became a widespread practice. In 1942, she urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades, saying: [...] "if I were of a debutante <b>age</b> <b>I</b> would go into a factory–any factory where I could learn a skill and be useful." [...] Roosevelt learned of {{the high rate of}} absenteeism among working mothers, and she campaigned for government-sponsored day care. She notably supported the Tuskegee Airmen in their successful effort to become the first black combat pilots, visiting the Tuskegee Air Corps Advanced Flying School in Alabama. She also flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred [...] "Chief" [...] Anderson. Anderson had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots; he took her on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub. After landing, she cheerfully announced, [...] "Well, you can fly all right." [...] The subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt did use her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field.|$|E
500|$|In 1908, Chamberlin {{was hired}} to lead the Biology Department at Brigham Young University (BYU), [...] a {{university}} {{owned and operated by}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), during a period which BYU president George H. Brimhall sought to increase its academic standing. LDS College professor J. H. Paul, in a letter to Brimhall, had written Chamberlin was [...] "one of the world's foremost naturalists, though, I think, he is only about 28 years of <b>age.</b> <b>I</b> have not met his equal... We must not let him drift away". Chamberlin oversaw expanded biology course offerings and led insect-collecting trips with students. Chamberlin joined a pair of newly hired brothers on the faculty, Joseph and Henry Peterson, who taught psychology and education. Chamberlin and the two Petersons worked to increase the intellectual standing of the University. In 1909 Chamberlin's own brother William H. Chamberlin {{was hired to}} teach philosophy. The four academics, all active members of the Church, were known for teaching modern scientific and philosophic ideas and encouraging lively debate and discussion. The Chamberlins and Petersons held the belief that the theory of evolution was compatible with religious views, and promoted historical criticism of the Bible, the view that the writings contained should be viewed from the context of the time: Ralph Chamberlin published essays in the White and Blue, BYU's student newspaper, arguing that Hebrew legends and historical writings were not to be taken literally. In an essay titled [...] "" [...] Chamberlin concluded: [...] "Only the childish and immature mind can lose by learning that much in the Old Testament is poetical and that some of the stories are not true historically." [...] Chamberlin believed that evolution explained not only the origin of organisms but of human theological beliefs as well.|$|E
