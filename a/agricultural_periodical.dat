The first considers the practices for cultivating grain introduced by Mennonite farmers in Molotschna in the 1830 s; the second analyzes the wider contexts in which the Mennonites developed the practices and the motivations behind them. The article is based on a range of primary sources including reports by Mennonite leaders to the Russian authorities, studies of Mennonite agriculture by visiting specialists, and articles by Mennonite and Russian authors published in contemporary Russian <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals</b> and preserved in archives in Russia and Ukraine. It also draws on the recent edition of the correspondence of pioneering Mennonite farmer and leader Johann Cornies. Reference is made to a selection of the extensive secondary literature on the Mennonite colonies and steppe farming.

While in London, he began his journalistic career, contributing regularly to Farmers Weekly, The Dairy Farmer, and other <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals.</b> He also became active in the Peace Movement after attending lectures by Canon Dick Sheppard who founded the Peace Pledge Union in 1934. Newman Turner later became chairman of the Golders Green branch of the PPU. It was here that he met Hugh J. Schonfield who invited him to become Vice President of his newly formed Society for the Creation of a Holy Nation, later renamed Commonwealth of World Citizens. Newman Turner registered as a conscientious objector (CO) in 1940 and became the manager of Goosegreen Farm, near Bridgwater in Somerset, which was run {{by a group of}} pacifists and Quakers as a training centre for COs who were required to work on the land.|$|R
5000|$|In {{summer of}} 1862, Flint took an {{extended}} break in Europe {{during which he}} would pass through multiple countries and communicate with the farmers from each one. While passing through Germany, many of these farmers conversed with him about a grand-scale International Exhibition in Hamburg being planned July of the following year. It was to his surprise when, {{in the spring of}} 1863, the Board of Agriculture (along with every other state and Federal agricultural body) was given an invitation to attend this convention. The Board decided to name a commissioner to travel with the other state officials who would be in attendance, to which Flint received the appointment [...] "unsought and unexpectedly". His detailed account of the exposition {{can be found in the}} Board's Eleventh Annual Report.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how selection of informational sources and media presentation of material contribute to the bias levels of articles in two types of periodicals-news and agricultural-in regards to the environment and food safety. The three <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals</b> with the largest circulations-Farm Journal, Progressive Farmer, and Successful Farming [...] and the three news periodicals with the largest circulations-Newsweek, Time, and U. S. News & World Report-were evaluated for the {{purpose of this}} study. Articles were selected for the 10 -year period from 1987 - 1996 and evaluated using the Hayakawa-Lowry method of determining bias. It was determined that the most used sources of information by journalists were educational and governmental. Articles were often printed in sections of the publication that appeared to have no relationship to the nature of the article. The depth in reporting of environmental and food safety issues was lacking. There was little difference in the presentation of articles between news and agricultural magazines. Both used articles in various locations, used pictures that generated an emotional response from readers, presented stories of various lengths, used a range of reporters to cover stories, and sought information from various sources. News magazines also used artwork, which almost always conveys a biased message...|$|R
40|$|Chemicals used {{to control}} {{agricultural}} diseases and pests have formed a significant aspect of rural life in Britain {{since at least the}} mid-eighteenth century. This paper argues that agricultural chemicals have long been subject to public health and environmental concern. Harnessing <b>agricultural</b> textbooks, <b>periodicals</b> and newspaper reports, this paper charts the use of arsenic and copper sulphate as means of preventing fungal disease in wheat {{over the course of the}} eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. During this time the dangers and benefits associated with chemical seed steeps – a mixture of water with arsenic or copper sulphate in which seeds were immersed – were thoroughly explored: landowners and agricultural improvers released their own recipes, suggested alternative remedies for fungal disease and even carried out crop trials to test the efficiency of chemical preventatives. Yet by the mid-nineteenth century, seed steeps had become an issue of public health and government concern, as noxious substances poisoned game birds intended for human consumption. Embracing a ‘long-run’ history of agricultural chemicals enriches current debates on the use, regulation and impact of these products...|$|R
40|$|The Morrill Act of 1862, a {{piece of}} federal {{legislation}} enacted {{a century and a}} half ago, lives on today. That law allocated thousands of acres of federal land to state governments, based on the size of their congressional delegations, so they could establish colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts and give a college education, liberal and practical, to students who could not otherwise afford one. The Morrill Act lives on because the 2 ̆ 2 land-grant colleges 2 ̆ 2 it endowed with financial resources still exist today, operating on billion-dollar budgets and enrolling tens of thousands of students. Further, at least at Iowa State University, each incoming president 2 ̆ 7 s in-augural address has involved an explanation of the land-grant idea. In the past three decades, that explanation has devolved from the broad view, held for a century, that land-grant colleges should prepare their students to be productive economically and politically, that they should educate them to be competent engineers and agriculturists as well as civic-minded people capable of acting not just in someone 2 ̆ 7 s private interest, but in their commu-nity 2 ̆ 7 s - their polity 2 ̆ 7 s - public interest. The latest presidents of Iowa State have, since the 1980 s, put forward an explanation of the land-grant idea that places economic values, rather than politi-cal values, at the center of the university 2 ̆ 7 s existence. The work of historians of agriculture and the land-grant colleges has not been much better, the former paying little attention to the land-grant colleges and the latter more often than not failing to see the larger context in which the col-leges were created and have existed. This thesis investigates the ideology that played a role in Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s creation in the late 1850 s and early 1860 s as the Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm. In the mid- to late 1850 s, acting out of a concern for declining soil fertility (or the potential for it), the Iowa State Agricultural Society formulated an ideology of sustainable land use, scientific inves-tigation of farming techniques, and the equal dignity of labor (agricultural and mechanical work) with the more esteemed professions. The Society turned to a number of educational institutions, including annual fairs, <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals,</b> seed distribution programs by the federal govern-ment, township-level farmers 2 ̆ 7 clubs, the state geological survey, and the state agricultural college, chartered in 1858, before the Morrill Act 2 ̆ 7 s passage. The author undertook this thesis because he believes that, if Iowa State 2 ̆ 7 s administration are going to invoke the history of the Morrill Act to rationalize their actions, they ought to know what that history is...|$|R
40|$|Latin America and Caribbean {{countries}} {{have made a}} strong effort to accomplish the taking of Agricultural Censuses following the World Programme promoted by FAO. In comparison with previous decades the present one (1996 - 2005) shows exceptional improvements in agricultural censuses in the area. In this paper, a brief update {{of the situation is}} done. At the same time, some problems in international comparisons are analised and practical solutions to particular problems are presented. Finally, the 2001 Agricultural Census in Nicaragua is presented as a study-case. This census was chosen because of some particularities in its planning and execution and the completeness of the excercise which included the practical implementation of Zarkovich's methodollogy for a post enumeration survey on census coverage, its use in building a multiple frame for <b>periodical</b> <b>agricultural</b> surveys and four special in-deep studies derived from it...|$|R
40|$|We, in agriculture, {{shall not}} be where we must without {{the passion of the}} {{agricultural}} press of ACP countries. Read all about it. The end of the month is always a critical time in farming. It's the time to review sowing campaigns, check forage stocks, plan weeding, maintain tools and machines. Much depends on the weather, and on whether such inputs as fuels, fertiliser and cash are obtainable, all of them having become less reliable - with some believing that even the climate has been given a dose of structural adjustment, so variable has it become! Depending {{on the nature of the}} agricultural business, salaries and bills are due to be paid, reports written, funding proposals delivered, even tax or insurance forms completed. All in all, a familiar pattern, shaped by deep-rooted farmer savvy and by bureaucracy, and often recorded in those little diaries known as farmers' almanacs. Many drums, one beat The same regularity, quarterly, monthly, weekly or even daily, dominates the life of a newspaper or magazine publisher. This holds whether you're in charge of a community broadsheet, or one of the recently emerged papers in many an ACP country which have been welcomed as flag-bearers of plurality and press freedom. And it also holds for the new wave of farmers' magazines sweeping through our rural landscapes. Take the case of The Farmer's Voice (see Spore 101), the Cameroonian monthly which is a role model for many agricultural newspapers. In the last week of each month, the editors of the French and English editions get together with the publisher and editor-in-chief, in their orderly and none-too-spacious offices in central Yaoundé, the nation's capital. So it was with their meeting at the end of February 2003. They reviewed last-minute adjustments to the layout and content of the March issue. Then they turned their minds to the April issue; they finalised stories; they selected as many readers' letters as they could; they discussed the impact of a recent Spore article about their Website; and they caught up on the report about the distribution of the February edition (see yellow box). Similar scenes take place in the editorial offices of hundreds of <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals</b> across the globe, be it the editorial conference of the daily agricultural bulletin in Suva, Fiji, or Spore's own bi-monthly committee, described in Spore 99 and 101 respectively. Or the monthly sessions of the new Farmers' Monthly magazine, striving to develop a niche in South Africa's new sector of emerging farmers. Whose news? How much are they all one of a kind, these newspapers and magazines? Some belong to a particular sector, such as CitriNews of the Citrus Growers Association of Belize or the well-endowed and colourful Horticulture in Malawi magazine. A few, such as The African Farmer and Benin's monthly Agri-Culture, are explicitly commercial, struggling to stay above the break-even point in a fragile market. The standard model of an ACP farmers' magazine is not just about farming but about rural life and environments in general. An example is Communautés Africaines, published by the APICA NGO enterprise in Douala, Cameroon (again!), and approaching its third decade as a newsletter about small-scale agricultural technologies, with handy hints for improving village infrastructures in water supply, lighting or education. It has never erred from the classical model of a simple standard design, once typed but now produced using simple desk-top publishing software. The AgriPromo bulletins of INADES-Formation in Côte d'Ivoire and Ecoforum from the Environment Liaison Centre International in Kenya have shown similar staying power. They are all driven by a service attitude, with an almost evangelical fervour, and external funding. The most recent wave of publications has come from the now ubiquitous federations of farmers' organisations (FFO), typified by La voix des producteurs, produced by the Fédération des unions des producteurs du Bénin (FUPRO). They carry an FFO's multiple burdens, with an esoteric mix of market information, crop guidelines and reports on changes in the organisation. The same mixture is found in Ground-Up which promotes the messages of the Participatory Ecological Land-Use Management (PELUM) Association, a network of 130 FFOs and other civil society bodies in southern Africa. As these federations grow into their multi-task roles of being service-provider in the village and field, and representative in local and national political fora, they will no doubt separate the institutional from the technical in their range of publications. These are best kept apart. Do you believe? What keeps these publications going? Faith, faith, and more faith. Their financial viability is their weakest point but the demand, if not a paying market, is strong. The sums are simple enough: major income does not come from sales, but from grants, loans and increasingly advertising. In a measured way, this is the only way to keep income at a level that will allow investment in new production technology, in the crucial distribution chain and in sustainable staffing. Information is in better supply, in part through sharing news through the Internet. The transformation of information into knowledge is a skill that will develop as training in agricultural journalism and professional networks grow. As the mighty World Association of Newspapers is expected to conclude at its June 2003 meeting in Ireland on 'Strengthening the Future of Newspapers', the viability of any newspaper will depend on its ability to develop additional information services and use new media. Then it will thrive. And in the brittle world of <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals</b> in ACP countries, thrive they must. When Spore interviewed the editor of The Farmer's Voice for this article, the talk was not about the newspaper's image or its editorial process. We talked for hours about how it is used by readers as a forum to settle, or record the settling of, the occasional tensions and stresses that are inevitable in the dynamics of local development initiatives. When readers make a mediator of the press, the publishers must make sure they stay in business. Without the impassioned engagement of the agricultural press of the ACP countries, agriculture will not arrive where we want to carry out it...|$|R
40|$|Librarians and {{trainers}} {{working together}} in Africa If {{everyone involved in}} agricultural development {{had access to the}} right information, at the right time and in the right place, many problems in this field could be resolved overnight. In an effort to get closer to this ideal, CTA and IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) brought together 15 reference librarians, agronomists, trainers and publishers based in anglophone Africa for a workshop from June 15 - 26, 1987 in Lilongwe, Malawi. This workshop was held to complement one for francophone participants (held in December 1986 in Dakar) and saw ten countries represented: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. The training team consisted of both ACP and European specialists in this field including S. Keena of IFD; W. Robert, J. Kinney, P. Wortley and M. Kinch. The major agricultural databases and principal suppliers of background information were represented by E. Lebowitz of AGRIS, J. Loder of CABI, K. Russel of the U. S. NAL, D. Hall of IFIS and D. Wood of the British Library Document Supply Centre. Identifying user needs This meeting not only enabled the participants to better appreciate analytical methodologies and identify user needs, but also increased their familiarity with primary and secondary information sources dealing with tropical agriculture. Emphasis was placed on the means of improving the publication, distribution and acquisition of documents as well as inter-library loans. The objective is to ensure the availability and accessibility of documentation through the supply of photocopies or microfilm. The potential of CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read Only Memory; see Spore 9) was also covered. This new technology promises considerable advances for improving access to information. Furthermore, it appears to be quite appropriate for developing countries as it is sturdy, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and does not depend on unreliable telecommunication systems. The workshop also considered the role librarians can play as intermediaries between producers and consumers of information, an aspect which is unfortunately often underestimated. The approach taken by the workshop itself was to encourage the sharing of the practical experiences {{of the participants in the}} use of resources. The presentation of national reports and the ensuing discussion enabled the identification of a certain number of major problems that were subsequently treated in detail. This session had little in common with an academic course: the theoretical presentations were only used to introduce the practical work Concrete results Among other things, this part of the workshop dealt with the use of bibliographies, abstracts and directories. A concrete result was the compilation of several guides to inforrnation sources notably a 'List of <b>agricultural</b> <b>periodicals</b> in Africa', a 'Directory of research centres, universities and rural development departments in Africa' and a 'Bibliography of agricultural bibliographies dealing with Africa'. If the first two guides will remain as working documents, the third one will be developed further and jointly published by CTA and the International Federation for Documentation (IFD) in 1988. The value of this bibliographic directory is that it offers a synthesis of agricultural information relevant for use in Africa. Other practical results of the workshop included two project proposals. The first calls for the preparation of a bibliography on women and development in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia, and the second for the rehabilitation of the documentation resources of the Department of Agriculture in Ghana. Both of these projects may be funded by CTA or the FAO as a follow-up to this workshop. Exhaustive but productive Two field trips were organized for participants. The first one saw them visit the library of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of Malawi (Bunda College) where they were briefed on a course erititled 'How to use documentation'. During the second visit, at the Department of Agricultural Research in Chitedze, they were given a demonstration on the use of micro-computers for literature searches, the development of local data bases, and access to international agricultural databases (notably CABI and AGRICOLA) with CDROM technology. Two aspects of this training proved to be particularly popular with participants: information retrieval from different sources (individuals, institutions and documents) and the collection of current agricultural documentation produced at the national level in order to stock a national agricultural library. According to the evaluation sheets, the workshop was exhaustive but highly productive. As a result of similarly positive reviews of the Dakar workshop, CTA intends to continue this kind of training activity. One is planned for 1988 in the Pacific region and another in 1989 for the Caribbean. A report on these activities, including an evaluation, is planned.

60|$|I {{went out}} twice to Benton Barracks, as the camp of wooden huts was called, which General Fremont had erected near the fair-ground of the city. This fair-ground, I was told, {{had been a}} {{pleasant}} place. It had been constructed for the recreation of the city, and {{for the purpose of}} <b>periodical</b> <b>agricultural</b> exhibitions. There is still in it a pretty ornamented cottage, and in the little garden a solitary Cupid stood, dismayed by the dirt and ruin around him. In the fair- green are the round buildings intended for show cattle and agricultural implements, but now given up to cavalry horses and Parrott guns. But Benton Barracks are outside the fair-green. Here on an open space, some half mile in length, two long rows of wooden sheds have been built, opposite to each other, and behind them are other sheds used for stabling and cooking places. Those in front are divided, not into separate huts, but into chambers capable of containing nearly two hundred men each. They were surrounded on the inside by great wooden trays, in three tiers--and on each tray four men were supposed to sleep. I went into one or two while the crowd of soldiers was in them, but found it inexpedient to stay there long. The stench of those places was foul beyond description. Never in my life before had I been in a place so horrid to the eyes and nose as Benton Barracks. The path along the front outside was deep in mud. The whole space between the two rows of sheds was one field of mud, so slippery that the foot could not stand. Inside and outside every spot was deep in mud. The soldiers were mud-stained from foot to sole. These volunteer soldiers are in their nature dirty, as must be all men brought together in numerous bodies without special appliances for cleanliness, or control and discipline as to their personal habits. But the dirt {{of the men in the}} Benton Barracks surpassed any dirt that I had hitherto seen. Nor could it have been otherwise with them. They were surrounded by a sea of mud, and the foul hovels in which they were made to sleep and live were fetid with stench and reeking with filth. I had at this time been joined by another Englishman, and we went through this place together. When we inquired as to the health of the men, we heard the saddest tales--of three hundred men gone out of one regiment, of whole companies that had perished, of hospitals crowded with fevered patients. Measles had been the great scourge of the soldiers here--as it had also been in the army of the Potomac. I shall not soon forget my visits to Benton Barracks. It may be that our own soldiers were as badly treated in the Crimea; or that French soldiers were treated worse in their march into Russia. It may be that dirt and wretchedness, disease and listless idleness, a descent from manhood to habits lower than those of the beasts, are necessary in warfare. I have sometimes thought that it is so; but I am no military critic, and will not say. This I say--that the degradation of men to the state in which I saw the American soldiers in Benton Barracks is disgraceful to humanity.|$|R
