40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to know: 1) which one of TAI, TTW, and direct {{learning}} models that resulted in better students’ mathematics learning achievement on function; 2) which one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with climbers, campers, and quitters AQ category who had better mathematics learning achievement on function; 3) for each AQ caegory, which one of TAI, TTW, and direct learning models that could make the students get better mathematics achievement; 4) for each learning model, which one of climber, campers, and quitters students category that resulted in better mathematics achievement. This was a quasi experimental research with 3 x 3 factorial design. <b>The</b> population <b>of</b> this research consisted <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> students in eighth grade of Junior High Schools in Boyolali Regency during <b>the</b> academic year <b>of</b> 2015 / 2016. The sampling was conducted by stratified cluster random sampling technique. The instruments used to collect the data were the students’ mathematics test result and adversity quotient questionnaire. Before being used to collect the data, the test and questionnaire instruments were tried-out. Validity test was conducted by the validator. Questionnaire instrument reliability test was conducted by using Cronbach alpha formula while internal consistency test was conducted by using product moment correlation formula from Karl Pearson. Instrument reliability test was conducted by using KR- 20 formula and discrimination power by using product moment correlation by Karl Pearson. Balance test was conducted by one-way ANAVA test. Prerequisite test consisted of normality test by using Lilliefors testing method and homogeneity test by using Barttlet method. Data analyzing technique used were two-ways ANAVA test with unbalanced cell. Based on the hypothesis test, it was concluded as follows. 1) <b>The</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by TAI learning model was better than <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by TTW and direct learning model on function, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by TTW learning model was better than <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by direct learning model on function. 2) <b>The</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with climbers category was better than <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with campers or quitters category and <b>the</b> learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> campers category students was better than <b>the</b> learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> quitters category students on function. 3) The students with climbers category who were treated by TAI, TTW, and direct learning models had the same mathematics learning achievement; <b>the</b> mathematics <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> the students with campers category who were treated by TAI learning model was same <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by TTW learning model and was better than <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by direct learning model, while <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by TTW learning model was better than <b>the</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who were treated by direct learning model; the students with quitters category who were treated by TAI learning model had better mathematics learning achievement than the students with TTW and direct learning model, the students mathematics learning achievement with TTW learning model was same the students with direct learning model. 4) In TAI learning model, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with climbers category was better than <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with campers and quitters category, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with campers category was same the students with quitters category; in TTW learning model, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with climbers category was same <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with campers category and was better than the students with quitters category, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with campers category was better than the students with quitters category; in direct learning model, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with climbers category was better than the students with campers and quitters category, <b>the</b> mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students with campers category was same the students with quitters category.

The Study also examined {{whether there was}} a significant difference in terms of gender towards writing <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. It was quantitative correlational research. <b>The</b> sample consisted <b>of</b> 45 students of English Study Program, Sriwijaya State Polytechnic. Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) by Vallerand et al. (1992) with some modification conducted by researcher was used as a measure to find out <b>the</b> academic motivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students and demographic questionnaire was used to find out name, class, gender and parental education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. Meanwhile, the data about writing <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students were taken from the archive in English Study Program, Sriwijaya State Polytechnic. The results showed that academic motivation added to parental education correlated significantly towards writing <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students (R= 0. 837); and there was no significant difference in terms of gender towards writing <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. Hopefully, future studies will investigate why and how academic motivation added to parental education influenced and gave contribution to writing <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students...|$|R

The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets.
