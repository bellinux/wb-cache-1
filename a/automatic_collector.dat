40|$|AbstractThe {{stagnation}} temperatures {{experienced by}} glazed photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors {{pose a threat}} to their performance and longevity, in part due to the limited temperature stability of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants. In order to identify suitable solutions for application in residential solar domestic hot water (SDHW) PV-T systems, a comparative analysis of known overheating prevention and stagnation handling measures was conducted and dynamic simulations were used to support the analysis. While no measure was found to comply with all desirable goals including reliability, implementation and operation costs, integral venting mechanisms were identified as the most promising among the control systems reviewed. Moreover, active collector heat dumping and <b>automatic</b> <b>collector</b> shading led to minimal electrical efficiency increases and decreases, respectively, while purging tank water when the collector overheats was found to be ineffective due to delays in the start of circulation...|$|E
40|$|Deposition {{is one of}} the {{key terms}} of the mineral dust cycle. However, dust {{deposition}} remains poorly constrained in transport models simulating the atmospheric dust cycle. This is mainly due to the limited number of relevant deposition measurements. This paper aims to present an <b>automatic</b> <b>collector</b> (CARAGA), specially developed to sample the total (dry and wet) atmospheric deposition of insoluble dust in remote areas. The autonomy of the CARAGA can range from 25 days to almost 1 year depending on the programmed sampling frequency (from 1 day to 2 weeks respectively). This collector is used to sample atmospheric deposition of Saharan dust on the Frioul islands in the Gulf of Lions in the Western Mediterranean. To quantify the mineral dust mass in deposition samples, a weighing and ignition protocol is applied. Almost 2 years of continuous deposition measurements performed on a weekly sampling basis on Frioul Island are presented and discussed with air mass trajectories and satellite observations of dust. Insoluble mineral deposition measured on Frioul Island was 2. 45 g m − 2 for February to December 2011 and 3. 16 g m − 2 for January to October 2012. Nine major mineral deposition events, measured during periods with significant MODIS aerosol optical depths, were associated with air masses coming from the southern Mediterranean Basin and North Africa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Garbage {{collection}} systems {{ease the}} burdon on programmers of manually handling the memory management. There {{is no need}} to keep track of used and unused memory objects any longer, the <b>automatic</b> <b>collector</b> takes over that work. Many garbage collection algorithms have been introduced, most of them having to suspend the main program in order to identify and release unused nodes in memory. Here in this paper I describe methods on how to allow the garbage collector to incrementally identify the garbage without having to suspend the program, letting the collector run concurrently to it. This paper is the first part of a three paper series on incremental garbage collection. Its main intention is to give a general overview of the motivation for, the fundamental priciples of and some basic algorithms used for this advanced type of garbage collector system. Index Terms [...] Garbage collection, incremental garbage collection, tricolor marking, write-barrier, read-barrier, Baker’s algorithm. I. NOMENCLATURE Several terms and definitions used in this paper deserve separate explaination: Mutator: This is an arbitraty program that mutates (allocates, uses, abandons) data in memory. It is the task of the (garbage) collector to search for and free data of the system memory when the mutator does not need it any longer without the mutator explicitly having to order that. Collector: Short for “garbage collector”. This is the process that, using techniques described in this paper, identifies memory not used by the mutator any longer and releases it. Floating Garbage: This term is used for unreferenced objects that are not (yet) recognized by the algorithm to be garbage. Ususally it takes another run of the garbage collector for the floating garbage to be recognized as such. Conservativity: The conservativity of an algorithm describes how eager it is to free potential garbage. The more conservative an algorithm is the higher are the chances that garbage is not recognized immediately and thus not free...|$|E

40|$|I’ve {{tried to}} find the most {{effective}} and cost effective way to harvest straw for energy recovery. You can choose between round bales and big square bales. Square bales are the cheapest way to produce straw for fuel recovery because you can optimize the length of the bales so they fit the transportation equipment. In the Malmö area the average days of harvesting hay is 55. The effectively of transportation depends mostly of the speed, the distance and density of the bales. To increase the capacity of bale transportation larger loads and higher density of the bales is necessary. The traffic rules limit the size of the transportation vehicles. Straw is fully storable with a humidity of 18 % but the most straw power plants accepts a humidity of 20 %. The most contract hay harvesting company’s stops baling at a humidity of 19 %. The storage of the bales is first on the field and later on a bigger storage area. There are plenty of systems to choose between when collecting bales from the field to the storage area. The cheapest way for collecting bales from field to the storage area on the field is with a tractor and an <b>automatic</b> bale <b>collector.</b> The system is cheapest because there is only one man required for collecting and stacking. No Wheel loader is nesessary in this system. Handle the straw are expensive. Each time you move a bale the bale-cost rise. It’s important have an effective handling of the bales and reduces the number of times the bales will be removed to lover the cost of bale handling. The wheel loader gets more effective if it’s equipped with a bale squeeze then a bale spear during truck loading. If the baler is equipped with a bale collector you save a lot of time during bale handling, you don’t need to collect the bales with a wheel loader on the whole field because the bales are automatically collected on the field’s turning point. Conclusions: • Big square bales are the cheapest {{and the best way to}} produce hay bales. • Tractor and <b>automatic</b> bale <b>collector</b> are the most economic way to collect a big number of round bales and square bales. • To increase the capacity of bale transportation larger loads and higher density of the bales is necessary. • Balers equipped with cutting section are more expensive than regular balers even when it’s used more hours per yea...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Plants {{and herbs}} have been {{utilized}} for centuries by traditional medicinal systems (e. g. TCM, Ayurveda) to alleviate minor illnesses and major diseases. In recent decades, interest in traditional medicine has increased significantly among drug development institutions. Currently, several research groups worldwide are conducting isolation, characterization and bioassay evaluation of secondary metabolites from plants and herbs utilized in traditional medicine. Such research aims to produce potential lead therapeutic compounds for future evaluation in preclinical animal models. Also terrestrial and marine organisms {{have been shown}} to produce biologically active secondary metabolites. In this Master’s thesis, key elements in the preparation of animal experiments for the evaluation of lead therapeutic compounds against adenocarcinoma of the prostate are presented. Thus, potential medicinal sources, prostate cancer animal models, pharmacology of humans and animals, study design, metastasis, monitoring techniques and ethical aspects are described. The practical part of this Master’s thesis is focused on the isolation and characterization of flavonoids from the branches and leaves of Abies pindrow. Previous purification of this plant species has been reported in the literature. Methodological considerations: Low-pressure column chromatography is dependent on four mechanisms of separation: adsorption, size-exclusion, partition and ion-exchange. Silica gel column chromatography is a form of adsorption chromatography. Sephadex LH- 20 separates compounds mainly through size-exclusion, but adsorption can also be involved. Planar liquid chromatography comprises popular techniques such as TLC and PTLC, which are based on adsorption chromatography. MS and NMR are commonly employed in structure elucidation. MS is used to investigate molecular masses, while NMR describes the chemical environment of NMR active nuclei. Materials: A range of organic solvents were utilized in the isolation process. MeOH and CHCl 3 were most often employed. Much of the work involved both TLC and PTLC plates. Sephadex LH- 20 particles were employed more frequent than silica gel particles. The isolation process required equipment such as TLC and UV lamps, rotary evaporator and <b>automatic</b> fraction <b>collector.</b> MS and NMR analysis was performed to enable structure elucidation. Methods: Only simple chromatographic techniques were used. Analytical silica adsorbent TLC was employed throughout the isolation process. Silica adsorbent PTLC and polysaccharide size-exclusion chromatography were frequently employed. Silica gel column chromatography was only performed twice. Results and discussion: Nine compounds were initially isolated and purified. Two purified compounds were found to be the same prior to MS and NMR analysis, thus, only eight compounds were analyzed by MS and NMR. Out of these eight compounds, three were not pure enough to enable structure characterization and two were identified as the same compound on the basis of resulting spectra. Therefore, the isolation and identification of flavonoids from Abies pindrow yielded a total of four structurally dissimilar compounds. Conclusion: Four structurally dissimilar compounds were isolated through the use of simple chromatographic techniques and identified by MS and NMR analysis. All of the identified compounds belong to a class of plant secondary metabolites called flavonoids, or more specifically; flavonoid glycosides. They are known as: (1) kaempferol- 3 -O-(2 ʹʹ, 4 ʹʹ-di-E-p-coumaroyl) --L-rhamnopyranoside, (2) kaempferol- 3 -O--L-(4 ʹʹ-E-p-coumaroyl) -rhamnoside, (3) quercitrin and (4) afzelin. Hopefully, investigation of these compounds on a molecular and cellular level will result in novel lead therapeutic compounds against cancer for future evaluation in animal models...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} measure the mass flux of {{atmospheric}} insoluble deposition and to constrain regional models of dust simulation, a network of <b>automatic</b> deposition <b>collectors</b> (CARAGA) has been installed throughout the western Mediterranean Basin. Weekly samples of the insoluble fraction of total atmospheric deposition were collected concurrently on filters at five sites including four on western Mediterranean islands (Frioul and Corsica, France; Mallorca, Spain; and Lampedusa, Italy) {{and one in the}} southern French Alps (Le Casset), and a weighing and ignition protocol was applied in order to quantify their mineral fraction. Atmospheric deposition is both a strong source of nutrients and metals for marine ecosystems in this area. However, there are few data on trace-metal deposition in the literature, since their deposition measurement is difficult to perform. In order to obtain more information from CARAGA atmospheric deposition samples, this study aimed to test their relevance in estimating elemental fluxes in addition to total mass fluxes. The elemental chemical analysis of ashed CARAGA filter samples was based on an acid digestion and an elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry (MS) in a clean room. The sampling and analytical protocols were tested to determine the elemental composition for mineral dust tracers (Al, Ca, K, Mg and Ti), nutrients (P and Fe) and trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, V and Zn) from simulated wet deposition of dust analogues and traffic soot. The relative mass loss by dissolution in wet deposition was lower than 1  % for Al and Fe, and reached 13  % for P due to its larger solubility in water. For trace metals, this loss represented less than 3  % of the total mass concentration, except for Zn, Cu and Mn for which it could reach 10  %, especially in traffic soot. The chemical contamination during analysis was negligible for all the elements except for Cd, which has a very low concentration in dust. Tests allowed us to conclude that the CARAGA samples could be used to estimate the contents of nutrients and trace metals in the limits of loss by dissolution. Chemical characterization of CARAGA deposition samples corresponding to the most intense dust deposition events recorded between 2011 and 2013 has been performed and showed elemental mass ratios consistent with the ones found in the literature for Saharan dust. However, the chemical analysis of CARAGA samples revealed the presence of some anthropogenic signatures, for instance high Zn concentrations in some samples in Lampedusa, and also pointed out that mineral dust can be mixed with anthropogenic compounds in the deposition samples collected on Frioul. Results showed that the chemical analysis of CARAGA ashed samples can be used to trace the origins of elemental deposition. The elemental atmospheric fluxes estimated from these chemical analyses of samples from the CARAGA network of weekly deposition monitoring constitute the first assessment of mass deposition fluxes of trace metals and P during intense dust deposition events at the scale of the western Mediterranean Basin. The mass fluxes strongly depend on the distance from dust sources and the most intense events, while proximity from anthropogenic sources strongly impacted the masse fluxes of Zn and Cu at Lampedusa and Frioul...|$|R
