He successfully eliminated spending on space colonization research from the budget.

500|$|Two {{major public}} {{buildings}} are readily visible at {{the centre of}} the city– the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city. Completed during the reign of Macrinus in the early 3rd century, {{it is one of the}} finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at Leptis Magna in Libya. The building is [...] long by [...] wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held. Small temples and public offices also lined the [...] forum, which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries, of which only the pedestals now remain.

500|$|Steven Soderbergh was {{motivated}} {{to make an}} [...] "ultra-realistic" [...] film <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> health and scientific response to a pandemic.

Soderbergh acknowledged the salience of these post-apocalyptic themes is heightened by reactions to the September11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The movie was intended to realistically convey the [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "unnerving" [...] social and scientific reactions to a pandemic. The recent real-life epidemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic have been inspirations and influences in the film. The chain of contagion involving bats and pigs is reminiscent of the trail of the Nipah virus that originated in Malaysia in 1997, which similarly involved the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation.|$|E
500|$|The episode's airing—in particular, its shock regeneration—contributed to {{a public}} surge of interest, {{described}} by Daily Mail journalist Paul Revoir as [...] "Doctor Who fever". The regeneration prompted {{a large amount of}} speculation to Tennant's replacement: actor Robert Carlyle was the bookmaker's favourite to replace Tennant; and actors James McAvoy, Jason Statham, Alan Davies, and James Nesbitt were less popular predictions. In his article <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> reaction to the cliffhanger, Revoir offered five popular theories: a botched regeneration that resulted in two Doctors; a revelation that the whole series was dream sequence like the ninth season of Dallas; Tennant's successor being female; a normal regeneration; and a cover-up by the BBC to disguise the fact that [...] "Journey's End" [...] would be Tennant's last appearance; the first theory proved to be correct. The increase of public interest peaked in the two days prior to the transmission of [...] "Journey's End": the day before transmission saw the Seventh Doctor's actor Sylvester McCoy, Collinson, Davies, and Agyeman appear on separate daytime television shows; and coverage of the series finale was the top story in BBC News Online's entertainment section several hours before transmission.

500|$|Once {{the news}} of the cause of death of the Ngo {{brothers}} began to become public, the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings. Lodge cabled back, initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals, saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left {{on the floor of the}} vehicle. Rusk was worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating Đôn on the [...] "masterful performance" [...] of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. Đôn's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that [...] "I am sure assassination was not at their direction." [...] Minh and Đôn reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings. The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs W. Averell Harriman declared that [...] "it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed." [...] He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him. Embassy official Rufus Phillips, who was the US adviser to Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, said that [...] "I wanted to sit down and cry", citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|The way the {{situation}} had been handled was subject to criticism; firstly, the choice by Carmichael-Smyth to hold the firing drill parade was immediately criticised by his superior, Hewitt, who felt that had the parade not been held, the issue with the cartridges [...] "would have blown over." [...] Furthermore, a junior officer from Carmichael-Smyth's regiment, Lieutenant John Campbell MacNabb, felt that the drill parade was unnecessary and stated that the dislike held by the men toward their commanding officer was an aggravating factor in the events that followed. When Hewitt informed the Commander in Chief, Major General George Anson, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> nature of the men's sentence, and of placing them in irons {{in front of the}} entire Meerut Division, on 9 May, Anson confirmed the sentences but did not approve of the [...] "unusual procedure" [...] that Hewitt had followed. For his conduct on 10 May, Hewitt later faced criticism from Lieutenant General Sir Patrick Grant, (who was the acting Commander in Chief by that point, following Anson's death) and from John Lawrence (who was then Commissioner of Punjab province). Following the mutiny of the troops at Meerut, Hewitt's command of the Meerut Division was taken away. At a subsequent appeal, Hewitt and his immediate subordinate, Brigadier General Archdale Wilson of the Bengal Artillery, blamed each other for the way {{the situation}} unfolded; Hewitt said that Wilson was responsible for the tactics on the day, and Wilson stated that as Hewitt was the overall commander, responsibility lay with him; Hewitt lost the appeal. The historian Kim A. Wagner, in his 2010 book The Great Fear of 1857, stated that the senior officers' fear of [...] "making a 'wrong decision'" [...] led them to make no decision at all, [...] "with devastating results".|$|E

Moreover, the ambivalent Argentine position and the never ending Mapuche conflict overshadowed the Chilean perspective. J.

The paper analyzed data from the 2004 screening program, identifying sources of confounding or bias. Four indicators were examined, and none showed evidence that blood lead levels had been affected by the elevation of lead in drinking water. [...] The investigators concluded that the evidence did not clearly demonstrate a correlation between lead in the District's drinking water and blood lead levels. However, they cautioned that a population study was not suitable for establishing such relationships. They called for reduction in exposure from water as well as from other sources.
