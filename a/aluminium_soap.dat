40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the use of}} palm kernel oil {{for the production of}} bio-based lubricant. Laboratory scale quantities of aluminium grease were produced by saponification reaction through dissolving soaps made from different percentage of fats and palm kernel oil and saponified with calculated quantity of caustic soda in lubricating oil (SAE 20 - 50). These were later converted to <b>aluminium</b> <b>soap</b> using aluminium chloride solution prepared from reacting aluminium chips with dilute hydrochloric acid. Aluminium lubricating grease produced were subjected to physical characterisation tests such as relative density, melting temperature range and solubility in water. The results of Oando and Texaco conventional grease were used as control experiment having the same properties produced from 40...|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the civil war in 1991, the roughly 53 state-owned small, medium and large manufacturing firms were foundering, with the ensuing conflict destroying many of the remaining industries. However, primarily as a result of substantial local investment by the Somali diaspora, many of these small-scale plants have re-opened and newer ones have been created. The latter include fish-canning and meat-processing plants in the northern regions, as well as about 25 factories in the Mogadishu area, which manufacture pasta, mineral water, confections, plastic bags, fabric, hides and skins, detergent and <b>soap,</b> <b>aluminium,</b> foam mattresses and pillows, fishing boats, carry out packaging, and stone processing. In 2004, an $8.3 million Coca-Cola bottling plant also opened in the city, with investors hailing from various constituencies in Somalia. Foreign investment also included multinationals including General Motors and Dole Fruit.|$|R

All 4 townships of the District except Yesagyo were affected. 161 people were dead or missing according to Government data but total dead {{was more than}} 300 according to local news. 2657 households became homeless. 5 monasteries, 4 Dhammayons, 8schools and 2,927 animals were destroyed. The total loss in the flood amounted to 1,522.95 million MMK, according to official data. UN agencies and international nongovernmental organizations such as WFP, UNICEF, BAJ and others donated 6,800 bags of rice, 18,390 viss of edibleoil, 36,828 viss of gram and 3285 viss of salt worth US$ 261,620, 500 kilos of bleaching power, 440,000 tablets of water guard, 2,200 bottles of water guard, 2,200 sets of commodes, 2,2000 cakes of carbolic soap, 2,200 sets of water family kit, four 400-gallon-capacity fibre water tanks worth US$ 53,782, 287 viss of edible oil, 3,442 packets of instant noodle, 1,642 viss of salt, 821 tinned fish, biscuits, cakes of <b>soap,</b> <b>aluminium</b> pots, torch lights, dry cells, steel bowls and T-shirts worth MMK 3.46 million.|$|R
