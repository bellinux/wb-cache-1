The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for anime and manga have {{commented on}} the use of jutsu in the series. IGN called jutsu [...] "one of the most entertaining parts of the Naruto franchise", and noted that [...] "the complicated but impressive-looking hand gestures, the unique physical attributes, and the pure unadulterated destructive power of the ninjutsu <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that make the series wildly popular". T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews claimed that it was in [...] "fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades", and praised the [...] "invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques [...] manage to continuously infuse action sets with life". However, it criticized the [...] "overemployment of certain special techniques" [...] such as Naruto Uzumaki's Shadow Clone Technique, noting that the fights became [...] "bland and repetitive" [...] over time. Anime News Network (ANN) considered the structure of battles [...] "repetitive to a fault – a series of competing power-ups followed by an elegiac coda", but mollified by the series' [...] "winning formula: the villains are vile, the heroes sympathetic, and the stakes high".|$|E

6000|$|Now {{the things}} to be {{suffered}} are many, {{some of which are}} thus counted up: [...] "They were tortured,--had cruel mockings and scourgings;--they were stoned, were sawn asunder, were slain with the sword,--were tempted;--they wandered about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented" [...] (Heb 11:35-37). These <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that good men of old have suffered for their profession of the name of Jesus Christ. All which they were enabled by him to bear, to bear with patience; to bear with rejoicing; [...] "knowing in themselves that they had in heaven a better, and an enduring substance" [...] (Heb 10:32-34). And it is upon this account that Paul doth call to mind the most dreadful of his afflictions, which he suffered for the gospel sake with rejoicing; and that he tells us that he was most glad, when he was in such infirmities. Yea, it is upon this account that he boasteth, and vaunteth it over death, life, angels, principalities, powers, things present, things to come, height, depth, and every other creature: for he knew that there was enough in that love of God, which was set on him through Christ, to preserve him, and to carry him through all (2 Cor 12:9,10; Rom 8:37-39). That God has done thus, a thousand instances might be given; and that God will still do thus, for that we have his faithful promise (Isa 43:2; 1 Cor 10:13).|$|E
60|$|I read several books, {{and here}} <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I found out. One's shoes must {{be strong and}} heavy, and have pointed hobnails in them. The alpenstock must be of the best wood, for if it should break, loss of life might be the result. One should carry an ax, to cut steps in the ice with, on the great heights. There must be a ladder, for there are steep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrument--or this utensil--but could not be surmounted without it; such an {{obstruction}} has compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route, when a ladder would have saved him all trouble. One must have from {{one hundred and fifty}} to five hundred feet of strong rope, to be used in lowering the party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to be traversed in any other way. One must have a steel hook, on another rope--a very useful thing; for when one is ascending and comes to a low bluff which is yet too high for the ladder, he swings this rope aloft like a lasso, the hook catches {{at the top of the}} bluff, and then the tourist climbs the rope, hand over hand--being always particular to try and forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till he arrives in some part of Switzerland where they are not expecting him. Another important thing--there must be a rope to tie the whole party together with, so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless chasm in a glacier, the others may brace back on the rope and save him. One must have a silk veil, to protect his face from snow, sleet, hail and gale, and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy, snow-blindness. Finally, there must be some porters, to carry provisions, wine and scientific instruments, and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in.|$|E

60|$|I {{see myself}} {{moreover}} as somehow always alone {{in these and}} like New York flâneries and contemplations, and feel how the sense of my being so, being at any rate master of my short steps, such as they were, through all the beguiling streets, was probably the very savour of each of my chance feasts. Which stirs in me {{at the same time}} some wonder at the liberty of range and opportunity of adventure allowed to my tender age; though the puzzle may very well drop, after all, as I ruefully reflect that I couldn't have been judged at home reckless or adventurous. What I look back to as my infant license can only have had for its ground some timely conviction on the part of my elders that the only form of riot or revel ever known to me would be that of the visiting mind. Wasn't I myself for that matter even at that time all acutely and yet resignedly, even quite fatalistically, aware of what to think of this? I at any rate watch the small boy dawdle and gape again. I smell the cold dusty paint and iron as the rails of the Eighteenth Street corner rub his contemplative nose, and, feeling him foredoomed, withhold from him no grain of my sympathy. He is a convenient little image or warning of all that was to be for him, and he might well have been even happier than he was. For there was the very pattern and measure of all he was to demand: just to be somewhere--almost anywhere would do--and somehow receive an impression or an accession, feel a relation or a vibration. He was to go without many things, ever so many--as all persons do in whom contemplation takes so much the place of action; but everywhere, in the years that came soon after, and that in fact continued long, in the streets of great towns, in New York still for some time, and then for a while in London, in Paris, in Geneva, wherever it might be, he was to enjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and dawdling and gaping: he was really, I think, much to profit by it. What it at all appreciably gave him--that is gave him in producible form--would be difficult to state; but it seems to him, as he even now thus indulges himself, an education like another: feeling, as he has come to do more and more, that no education avails for the intelligence that doesn't stir in it some subjective passion, and that on the other hand almost anything that does so act is largely educative, however small a figure the process might make in a scheme of training. Strange indeed, furthermore, <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that have stirred a subjective passion--stirred it, I mean, in young persons predisposed to a more or less fine inspired application.|$|E
