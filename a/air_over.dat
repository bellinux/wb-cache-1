5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using ice to chill foods was a relatively simple process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also a tension between preserving the limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of <b>air</b> <b>over</b> it, and preserving the food, which depended on circulating more <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the ice to create colder temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the <b>air</b> <b>over</b> 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, Jeanne {{weakened}} to a Category 1 hurricane. It {{entered the}} western Gulf of Mexico, and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east. Later, Jeanne diminished to a 65mph (105km/h) tropical storm. A developing trough remained west of Jeanne, and the cyclone was {{embedded in a}} weak pressure gradient. Although Jeanne briefly re-intensified to 70mph (110km/h), an advancing frontal boundary brought dry <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the western Gulf of Mexico. Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14. It executed a clockwise loop, and it merged with the frontal boundary on November 16.|$|E

5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E
5|$|With a {{storm track}} {{very close to}} the shore and a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the interior served as the focus for a severe ice storm in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E

Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E

5|$|Nepartak {{originated}} {{in a region}} of strong thunderstorm activity, associated with a broad trough of low surface pressure, which was situated around 640km (400mi) southeast of Guam by 0000 UTC on November 11. With weak wind shear and modest divergence of <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the system, it began to mature, although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) downplayed the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next several hours, a low-level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it, prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook. At 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands. The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC, and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12. The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting <b>air</b> <b>over</b> mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the <b>air</b> <b>over</b> long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E
