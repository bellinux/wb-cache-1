60|$|Here Madam Rachel stopped, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} what to say.|$|E
60|$|Ethel, who {{scarcely}} {{knew what}} it was to be alone, looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand.|$|E
60|$|The patient {{opened her}} eyes slowly, and rolled them for a moment <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand.|$|E
6000|$|MAMMON: My dear friend, {{where are}} your wits? <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not always toast a piece of cheese And bait the trap? and rats, when lean enough To crawl through SUCH chinks-- ...|$|R
60|$|With {{flashing}} eyes, she stamped {{upon the}} ground <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> actually <b>did</b> it.|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} quiet. Now {{she began to}} feel again tired, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were <b>done.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Loveday turned, {{observed}} that Anne was gone, and said, 'What is it?' <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know.|$|E
60|$|Her uncle still {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} her identity, and still talked over her head <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not exist.|$|E
60|$|Poor old Mrs. Bates, {{civil and}} humble as usual, looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not quite {{understand}} what was going on.|$|E
50|$|He has {{conflict}} with both Finbar and Sorcha {{at the beginning}} of the story, because both remind him so much of his wife—Sorcha's looks and Finbar's stillness are both qualities she once had. He angrily snaps against Finbar's insistence that the Britons are human too, and treats Sorcha <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not exist, though it is later revealed that he loves her very much.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Maggie, I {{never made}} him love me," [...] cried Ursula, dismayed and suffering, and feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>done</b> {{something}} base.|$|R
60|$|A plump {{girl in a}} red hat, who {{had been}} dancing with a kind smile, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were <b>doing</b> it to amuse the children, left the floor.|$|R
60|$|Jo {{looked at}} her friend <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} him, then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.|$|E
60|$|Jane looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began {{speaking}} again to Mr. John Knightley.|$|E
6000|$|... "N-not exactly," [...] replied Amy, with a {{smile and}} glance of uncertainty, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not quite see the drift of the question.|$|E
6000|$|... "To let {{you know}} I'm not." [...] We each looked, I think, when she had said it, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>done</b> what <b>she</b> said. [...] "That's all." ...|$|R
60|$|Sophy {{was rather}} frightened, and felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>done</b> wrong in talking of oranges. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not know what}} to say, and only got out {{something}} about Johnnie and a comfort.|$|R
60|$|Awe-struck, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> dreaming, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not answer, only {{smoothing}} caressingly {{the long}} waves of bright brown {{hair on his}} forehead. She was surprised by his next question.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{we might}} walk together,' he {{suggested}} hesitatingly. She looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not quite know, and he settled the question by showing the way.|$|E
60|$|Ally looked coquettishly at me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} whether she should favor me to that extent, and the young princess was further solicited.|$|E
6000|$|... "But when I {{said that}} Stephen {{was much better}} to-day, she swept {{out of the room}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not care whether he lived or died." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the city, Assistant Commissioner Vetrimaaran (Arun Vijay) {{is celebrating}} his elder brother, Aravind (Amit Bharghav) and sister-in-law, Abhinaya's (Abhinaya) wedding anniversary. Everyone {{in the family}} is happy, except for Vetri's mother who berates Abhinaya for not giving her grandchildren despite having been married for so many years. However, after {{successfully}} undergoing treatment by a famous fertility specialist, Dr. Tulsi (Kalyani Natarajan), Abhinaya finally becomes pregnant. While {{the rest of his}} family are in a celebratory mode, Vetri notices Abhinaya being moody most of the time, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not want the baby.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid her}} head on the pillow <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>done</b> with the subject, and Laura did not venture to pursue it, but went down to hear her mother's account of her.|$|R
50|$|The film {{consists}} of four episodes in the relationship of two young women: Reinette, a country girl, and Mirabelle, a Parisian. The first episode is entitled The Blue Hour and recounts their meeting. The second centers on a café and a difficult waiter. In the third, the girls discuss their differing views on society's margins: beggars, thieves and swindlers. In the fourth episode, Reinette and Mirabelle succeed in selling one of Reinette's paintings to an art dealer while Reinette pretends to be mute and Mirabelle, acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not know Reinette, does all the talking.|$|R
60|$|Ursula stared {{with a set}} face on the yard, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not hear. She loathed all this, and {{had ceased}} to feel or to exist.|$|E
60|$|Poor Belle blushed {{up to her}} forehead, {{tried to}} look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand, and gladly hid her {{confusion}} behind the recovered veil without a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Hetty, hastily turning {{round and}} {{reaching}} the second {{chair in the}} room, glad that Dinah looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not notice her ear-rings.|$|E
50|$|Sugar {{constantly}} teases Kim {{about her}} sexuality. At times, it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not realise the great {{extent to which}} her words hurt Kim. In Series 2, Sugar is incarcerated in a young offenders institute. She is in custody because she stabbed {{a man who was}} attempting to rape her. This occurred in the last episode of Series 1, where {{it is the first time}} she breaks down in tears. Sugar, however, is then quick to take charge of the situation by stealing a car with Kim and driving to London where they spend the night in a posh hotel.|$|R
5000|$|Scorned by {{the people}} of the valley as being [...] "hill-billies" [...] and [...] "hill scum", Heaven's pride remains intact, {{although}} she is wounded by her father, who ignores her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not exist while lavishing attention on the other children. One night, Heaven's granny takes her to the graveyard and shows her a gravestone with the word [...] "Angel" [...] carved upon it. Heaven learns that the reason for her father's animosity is that her birth caused the death of her real mother, Luke's first wife, whose real name was Leigh VanVoreen, but everybody in the Willies called her 'Angel'.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think Miss Maud would <b>do</b> full <b>as</b> well <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> Mike must be told, too, {{not to talk}} so much, {{and above}} all, not to speak so loud. He may be heard, sometimes, a dozen rods." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not feel}} the notion quite {{pleasant}} she turned from it. [...] "I suppose you've been writing {{all sorts of things}} since you came here." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} the question, {{and her eyes were}} troubled, although in such light as there was he could scarce see this.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Amelyn looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not care}} to discuss this problem. After a few moments Sadie continued, [...] "You and Lord Algernon are pretty old friends, I guess?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Madame Desmortes - The elderly matriarch of the family. She {{owns the}} château {{where the ball}} is taking place. She is aunt to Hugo, Frederic and Lady India. Mme. Desmortes comes from old money and {{possibly}} aristocracy - <b>she</b> certainly behaves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> but we cannot be sure - for after the Revolution(s) {{all sorts of people}} became aristocracy. She may be quite old, but she is alert and very bright. She is easily a match for Hugo and loves a good fight. Rank, roots, and pedigree are everything to her (appearances are all important). She has enjoyed a life of ease and some adventure.|$|R
60|$|As {{she came}} forward I noticed that her {{expression}} had changed somewhat. There was nothing merry about her eyes; I {{think she was}} slightly pale, and her brows were a little contracted, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were <b>doing</b> something <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not want to do.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>done</b> a {{shocking}} thing, and waited anxiously, while Dr. Spencer deliberately made a deep {{hole in the}} shingle with his stick. 'Well,' at last he said, 'I thought that matter was unknown to all men--above all to Dick!' ...|$|R
