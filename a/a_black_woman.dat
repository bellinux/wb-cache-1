5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman,</b> it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a Woman is {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare.

Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> <b>woman</b> writer.|$|E

Linnville, which is now a ghost town, was located 3.5 miles northeast of present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom).

5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E

In 1937 the gravestone for Harriet Tubman Davis was erected by the Empire State Federation of Women's Clubs; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In 1944, the United States Maritime Commission launched the SS Harriet Tubman, its first Liberty ship ever named for <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman.</b> In 1978, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp in honor of Tubman which made her the first African-American woman to be honored on a US Postage stamp.

5|$|In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and {{his brother}} Lakshmana riding the {{celestial}} elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in his lap and rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka {{and get into the}} Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, drenched in oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. <b>A</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey (vanara) messenger of Rama burns the city. Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materializes, she will protect her rakshasi guards.|$|E

25|$|Kit {{meets with}} Dr. Thredson (Zachary Quinto) and {{questions}} his own memory as Thredson shows him pictures of several victims, recounting {{what happened to}} each, including Kit's wife Alma (Britne Oldford). Thredson believes Kit could not function in society while secretly being married to <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman.</b> The killer skinned all of his victims, even Alma, so all would look the same in death. This causes Kit to ponder which is true – the alien abduction or {{that he is a}} serial killer.|$|E
25|$|Naomie Harris was {{initially}} reluctant to portray Paula, stating {{that she did}} not want to play a stereotypical depiction of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman.</b> When addressing her concerns, Jenkins emphasized the character’s representation of both his and McCraney's mothers. Harris later commented that although she had previously vowed not to portray a crack addict, the film's script and director's tolerance appealed to her. In preparation for her role, Harris watched interviews of those with addiction to crack cocaine, and met with addicted women. She related her experiences of bullying to the addicts' attempts of escaping trauma.|$|E

25|$|By 1977, Rose's {{father had}} come to {{tolerate}} his daughter's marriage, {{and to develop a}} grudging respect for Fred.

Reportedly, when Bill Letts discovered Rose's prostitution, he would also visit their home to engage in sex with his daughter. By 1983, she would give birth to eight children, at least three of whom were conceived by clients to whom she prostituted herself. Fred willingly accepted these children as his own, and would falsely inform them the reason their skin was darker than that of their siblings was because his own great-grandmother was <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E

Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (<b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> and a single mother) and Piestewa (a Hopi from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave {{more attention to the}} woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.|$|E
