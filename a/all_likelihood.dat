Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E

Like Kullback - Leibler separation they also are additive under factorization. These two properties allow us the prove that the precise specification of the prior will not be critical with respect to the variation distance on the posteriors under the following conditions. The genuine and approximating prior need to be similarly rough, the approximating prior has concentrated on a small ball on the margin of interest, not on the boundary of the probability space, and the approximating prior has similar or fatter tails to the genuine prior. Robustness then follows for <b>all</b> <b>likelihoods,</b> even ones that are misspecified. Furthermore, the variation distances can be bounded explicitly by a easy to calculate function the prior LDR and simple summary statistics of the functioning posterior.

Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood,</b> Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{our work}} towards a unified framework for automatic restoration {{of dirt and}} blotches in archive film. The framework we present here is composed of three stages, i. e. defect detection, false alarm elimination, and defect removal. First, we propose a novel probabilistic approach to detect defects in digitized archive film. An HMM is characterized and trained to model the statistical changes of temporal pixel transitions over several frames {{before and after the}} current frame. The trained HMM is then applied to measure how the likelihood of an unseen observation sequence being normal varies if each single observation within it was missing, one at a time in a leave-one-out fashion. The centre pixel of the observation sequence will be marked in the defect map, if the likelihood of the observation sequence without the centre pixel is larger, by a certain degree, than the average of <b>all</b> <b>likelihoods.</b> The resulting defect maps from our proposed defect detector encapsulates the true defects very well, but can suffer from many false alarms. Therefore, we extend the defect detection method to add a two-stage false alarm elimination process...|$|R

In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen Neferhetepes II. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, which makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood.</b> This is further confirmed by the discovery of Sahure's cartouche in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.|$|E

5|$|More than 200 Upanishads are known, {{of which}} the first dozen or so are {{the oldest and most}} {{important}} and are referred to as the principal or main (mukhya) Upanishads. The mukhya Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the Brahmanas and Aranyakas and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down orally. The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five of them in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> pre-Buddhist (6th century BCE), down to the Maurya period. Of the remainder, 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon, composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects which are unconnected to the Vedas.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

Ibn Tughj was named as the new governor in August but the appointment was revoked a month later before he could reach Egypt, and Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was appointed in his place. The timing of Ibn Tughj's recall coincides with the arrest (and subsequent murder) of Mu'nis by Caliph al-Qahir (r. 932–934) on 22 September, suggesting that Ibn Tughj's nomination was in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> also due to Mu'nis. The fact that al-Qahir sent a eunuch called Bushri to replace Ibn Tughj in Damascus {{after the fall of}} Mu'nis reinforces this view. Bushri was able to take over the governorship of Aleppo (to which he also had been appointed), but Ibn Tughj resisted his replacement, and defeated and took him prisoner.

40|$|Segregation {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} 79 nuclear families ascertained through chronic schizophrenic probands. Analysis {{was performed on the}} diagnosis of schizophrenia alone and on schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder (milder phenotype) combined. The models used were the transmission probability model and the mixed model. Because the disease is associated with reduced fertility, <b>all</b> <b>likelihoods</b> were calculated conditional on parental phenotypes. However, compatibility of the mating-type distribution predicted by each model with the observed was also examined. In all analyses, results suggested consistency with genetic transmission. In the analysis of schizophrenia alone, discrimination among models was difficult. In the analysis including the milder phenotypes, all single-locus models without polygenic background were excluded, while pure polygenic inheritance could not be eliminated. The polygenic model also gave good agreement with supplementary observations (lifetime disease incidences, mating-type distribution, and monozygotic twin concordance). The estimated components of variance for the polygenic model were: polygenes (H) 81. 9 %; common sib environment (B) 6. 9 %; random environment (R) 11. 2 %. Although the polygenic model was parsimonious, segregation analysis and the supplementary observations were also consistent with a mixed model, with a single major locus making a large contribution to genetic liability. Such a locus {{is more likely to be}} recessive than dominant, with a high gene frequency and low penetrance.

5|$|Theodore {{was capable}} and {{extremely}} ambitious. Notwithstanding his oath to Laskaris, he aspired {{not only to}} expand his state {{at the expense of}} Thessalonica, but to eventually recover Constantinople and revive the Byzantine Empire. To secure his northern flank, Theodore allied himself with Serbia and the Albanian clans. The Principality of Arbanon was already in the Epirote political orbit under Michael I, and closer ties developed when its ruler Demetrios died in 1215, leaving his principality to his widow, who promptly remarried the next year to a Greek magnate, Gregory Kamonas. Against the Serbs, Theodore abandoned Michael I's attempt to pursue a northward expansion into Zeta, and instead pursued an alliance with the Serbian prince Stefan II Nemanjić (r. 1196–1228) that was directed towards keeping the Bulgarians in check. The ties between Epirus and Serbia were solidified by the marriage of Theodore's brother Manuel Komnenos Doukas to one of Stefan II's sisters c. 1216. Stefan II then sought to wed one of his sons—in <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> his eldest son and heir, Stefan Radoslav—to Michael I's second daughter Theodora. The Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, refused to sanction the marriage due to consanguinity—Theodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav's mother, Eudokia Angelina, a daughter of Alexios III Angelos. In 1217, Stefan II tried to circumvent this by suggesting himself as the groom to Theodora's half-sister Maria, but Chomatianos vetoed this proposal as well on similar grounds. Finally, Stefan Radoslav married Theodore's firstborn daughter Anna in winter 1219/20.|$|E

On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer.

In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed.
