5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> {{to take advantage of the}} 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start the game from any level.|$|E
5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android. Its limb control system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> {{to walk with}} the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. <b>Its</b> vision system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears.

5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, which <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> {{to traverse}} the narrow alleyways {{common to the}} casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
50|$|Alpargatas {{relocated}} its {{manufacturing facilities}} {{to the southern}} suburb of Florencio Varela in 1950. This new, 70,000 m² (740,000 ft²) facility <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to diversify its product line, leading to the launching of Flecha, its casual footwear brand, in 1962. The establishment of a cotton gin in Sáenz Peña, a town in northern Argentina, allowed Alpargatas to manufacture denim in 1968, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to take advantage to fashion trends in that direction, and a new plant in Aguilares, Tucumán, <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to create its Pampero children's footwear line in 1972.|$|R

In its green form, it controls the element of air, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles.|$|R

5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Europa Orbiter — Its {{objective}} {{would be}} to characterize {{the extent of the}} ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to scan below the surface.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} into a {{military}} landowning family from the south of the Russian Empire, and followed the family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends.

50|$|A few snakes do {{not conform}} to these categories. Atractaspis is solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to strike without opening its mouth, perhaps <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to hunt in small tunnels.

5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion.

5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and {{in collaboration with}} scientists from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan. The A-10's armor is expected to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to survive the extreme meteorological conditions, such as 200mph hailstorms, found in inclement high-altitude weather events.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, Walternate (John Noble) has {{recovered}} {{the portion of}} the doomsday machine that Fauxlivia has secured from the prime universe, and has discovered the formulation for Cortexiphan from his tests on Olivia, but refuses to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to be tested on children. When he hears of Fauxlivia's pregnancy with his grandchild, Walternate comforts her and offers his complete support for her, believing the child to be another way to bring Peter voluntarily back to the parallel universe.|$|E

5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{campaigns for}} her staff's {{right to get}} flu shots from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Parnell), but Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) will not <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> due to a limited supply.

At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) try to do something nice for the crew.|$|E
5|$|The Navy, however, {{still had}} a {{requirement}} for a ship capable of defeating enemy cruisers and the original concept was revived as Project 69. The proposed size of the ship continually escalated as the requirement was revised to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to fight larger ships like the German s. The preliminary design was finally approved in January 1939 and two ships were laid down in November 1939, before the detailed design had even been approved.|$|E
50|$|Skin {{immunity}} is {{a property}} of skin that <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to resist infections from pathogens.
