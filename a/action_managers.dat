5000|$|Individuals present {{themselves}} cautiously {{to others in}} the environment. They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of <b>action.</b> <b>Managers</b> have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent. Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy resistance, job insecurity (Fox & Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin & Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic factors are present. This mental and emotional response {{is referred to as the}} face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or project. Team members consistently use statements like [...] "that project is Bob's baby," [...] or [...] "oh, we had the same idea." [...] Both ends of the spectrum are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially something that failed.|$|E

40|$|Maximum {{sustainable}} yield (MSY) {{has been}} adopted as the primary management goal by several inter-government fishery organisations, and in the United States it forms the cornerstone of federal fishery management policy. MSY became a strategic goal {{for the management of}} Europe's fisheries following the resolution of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 to restore or maintain fish stocks to MSY levels by 2015. Calculation of MSY requires information on the rate at which biomass increases through growth and reproduction and the rate at which it decreases through natural mortality and fishing. Population-selection, which measures the age-specific rates of fishing mortality, is a key component for the calculation of yield as a function of fishing mortality and MSY, yet selection rarely features in either management advice or sensitivity analyses. Effective management of selection can potentially lead to increases in long-term yield, but before taking <b>action</b> <b>managers</b> need to understand what long-term increases are possible. Using a hypothetical stock, equilibrium yield curves were calculated for three scenarios in which the shape of the population-selection curve varied. The results illustrate the potential extent of variation in MSY and the corresponding fishing mortality required to achieve it (FMSY) that may result solely due to changes in population selectivity. They show that relatively subtle changes in selection can produce substantial differences in MSY and FMSY. The results are discussed with specific reference to the development of long-term management targets and the mechanisms by which managers might try to influence population-selection.

This new era will likely be associated with increasing risk factors that agribusiness managers must consider in developing appropriate management strategies. Managers who can anticipate the changes in the economic environment and correctly alter their decisions to maximize returns, given an acceptable level of risk will likely improve the agribusiness's chances of success. The objective of this research is to evaluate an agribusiness's strategic plan in a risky economic environment. A firm level, financial risk analysis model (FRAN) will be used to quantify the probabilistic economic outcomes resulting from alternative equity management decisions. The analysis will provide the decision-makers with a tool to evaluate alternative equity management plans of <b>action.</b> <b>Managers</b> will be able to evaluate the likelihood of adverse risk and the benefits of transferring risk to other parties.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{scholarly}} interest has been mainly attracted {{on the nature}} of knowledge, mechanisms of knowledge production and the transformation of the institutions diffusing knowledge. Most of these studies share the underlying hypotheses that management knowledge "travels", as a package, from producers to passive receivers. A few exploratory attempts have envisioned an alternative perspective based on the idea of "knowledge consumption". Managers are active receivers of institutionalized knowledge in the course of enacting their organizational roles. Building on this last perspective, first we try to outline the process of knowledge consumption. We describe how sources of knowledge are selected, knowledge is acquired and consumed by assuming that managers are active consumer of management knowledge. Then, we construct the process linking the flows of management knowledge in organizations and the flows of action performed by managers. We sustain that knowledge has to be first dis-embed from the context and artifacts it is in to be translated into a portable form—a standardized artifact, a logic of action, etc. Then, specific courses of action are required to re-embed knowledge in new artifacts, practices or routines (e. g. a budgetary procedure, an organizational process, etc.). So, to re-embed knowledge in new contexts, managers have to mobilize resources and build consensus on the specific courses of action. By assuming this process, two consequences are derived: first, the dis-embedding/re-embedding process is not the outcome of conscious planning; it goes back and forth, allows for controversial or "hypocritical" moves, {{at least in the short}} run. In any case, once management knowledge is translated into logics of <b>action,</b> <b>managers</b> have to use their imaginative power to share these logics to mobilize constituencies on priorities and undertake specific courses of actions This supports the idea that the managerial role is intrinsically political. Second, management education cannot simply deals with managerial recipes and rules of thumb. It is increasingly asked for providing non-technical knowledge to help managers exert their political role. To mobilize constituencies and create consensus on controversial decisions, technicalities could be less relevant than business-unrelated knowledge. We hold that has a relevant impact on both the institutional settings and the content of management education. The paper is structured in three parts. First, a framework is proposed to describe management knowledge consumption. Second, we outline the process linking consumed knowledge with actual managerial action. Third, the impact of this perspective on the structure of the institutions diffusing knowledge and on the idea of what is needed to make managerial decisions are explored...|$|E
40|$|The project's main {{objectives}} were {{to facilitate the}} establishment of a planning capacity to enable the Ministry of Agriculture to foresee future manpower requirements and give policy guidance with respect to agricultural education and training; assist in the improvement of trained personnel management and career structures; and strengthen agricultural supervisory management to meet the agricultural sector's needs and organize relevant training. Assistance was provided to the Government in identifying the types and level of training most required in the agricultural sector, and a suitable data collection system was proposed for the future monitoring of manpower activities in the sector. A manpower data base was designed, in consultation with officers from the Ministry of Agriculture, and then made operational through the utilization of appropriate forms and tabular data entered in the software of the training management system. This allowed the identification of professional posts and the definition of technical competencies required in the Ministry. Project staff formatted the information available in the Learning Resources Centre (LRC) and entered it into the software, thus making it possible to obtain an up-to-date list of equipment and teaching aids existing in the LRC {{as well as of the}} courses available. In order to more clearly define the responsibilities of the Ministry's Personnel and Training Divisions and strengthen communication capacities, an information system was established, with information on job descriptions being collected by the Training Division and basic job requirements data being provided by the Personnel Division. Under this system, the preparation of the inventory of skills would remain the responsibility of the Training Division, which would periodically update it through annual appraisal reports received from the Personnel Division. In consultation with ministry staff, a manpower training plan was elaborated, which was in line with the Ministry's new policy, i. e., liberalization of the economy through allocation of certain functions and activities to the private sector, and promotion of agricultural exports. The specific aims of the training plan are, inter alia, to facilitate the process of computerization of the relevant manpower data and promote the exchange of information. This will be possible if it is complemented by a personnel policy aimed at improving work efficiency and productivity. It is recommended that the Training Division elaborate a clear set of rules and procedures for training, identification of training priorities and dissemination of relevant information to the units concerned. The role and functions of the Training Division vis--vis the technical divisions in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Public Service should be clarified. The organizational structure and functions of the Personnel Division within the Ministry of Agriculture should also be reviewed, with a view to increasing its output and efficiency. It is further suggested that the personnel appraisal system be reviewed and improved. In particular, the format and contents of the appraisal reports should be redesigned to include a performance plan showing progress over time, and specific proposals for remedial <b>action.</b> <b>Managers</b> and supervisors should be given appropriate training on the scope and modalities of the appraisal exercise. In order to promote the integration of functions and activities performed by the Ministry of Agriculture with those carried out by the Rural Authority for Agricultural Development (RADA) and other statutory bodies and development agencies operating in the agricultural sector, it is recommended that these agencies be informed of the methodology of the training analysis undertaken by the Training Division, as well as of the scope and structure of the new training plan, so as to facilitate information exchange and overall coordination of activities. An inventory of teaching aids (audiovisual or written material) already available (existing) in the Learning Resource Centre, or in other training institutions or development agencies, should be compiled, to improve the efficiency of training and avoid the duplication of activities. It is also recommended that the Training and Personnel Divisions within the Ministry take appropriate steps to improve the manpower planning functions and activities and put into operation the training management system...|$|E

Starting from an animation system that was developed in two other diplomna theses, a system for autonomous virtual humans was developed. The base of the system is a framework for behavior control of the virtual human. It consists of three parts: A perception module that gives information about the virtual environment and user commands to the virtual human, a planning system for the creation of plans, and an <b>action</b> <b>manager</b> that is responsible for the execution of the plans. The planner is a simple rule-based (reactive) planning system that can be extended with specialized planning algorithms. Those planning algorithms solve complex problems that are too hard for the reactive planner. Two complex problems that were dealt with are path-finding and grasping of objects. For path-finding one needs a proper representation of the virtual environment which is then used for searching a path. The A*-algorithm was used for the actual search on that representation; it was extended to take the height, width, step height and step length of the virtual human into account. Additionally, a connection had to be made between the path-finding module, the animation module, and the arbitrary scene. This enables the virtual human to follow a found path. The architecture of the system integrates the perception system, the planning system with specialzed planning algorithms, and the <b>action</b> <b>manager</b> with the visualization of the scene...|$|R
