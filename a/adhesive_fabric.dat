In order to {{stabilize}} the mosaic stones, in the next step, the carrier layer under the mosaic was removed and replaced by mortar.

5000|$|It {{was decided}} to create a special {{building}} for this work of art. It is located just behind the museum, west of it, and was baptized {{in the name of}} Archaeothiki. After completion of the building the mosaic had to be removed from the [...] "Villa des Dionysos". In the fall of 2015, conservators, archaeologists and workers began this project. In {{order to be able to}} divide the mosaic into several parts, the position and shape of the individual mosaic stones were first recorded on the intended dividing lines. They were then removed. A special <b>adhesive</b> <b>fabric</b> and textile strips were applied to fix the remaining stones in their place. The mosaic was divided into several, transportable, plates. After that, these plates had to be separated from the underlying ground. At the edge, with long drills, close to each other, holes were drilled into the ground beneath the fixed object. With flat steel blades, which were cut into the holes at certain intervals, experts separated the mosaic from the ground. Then it was carefully raised to allow a suitable steel plate to be driven underneath. The Helpers covered the surface with a wooden plate. With several belt tensioners, the plates (steel plate and wooden plate) were fixed against each other so that no movement was possible during transportation. Via a ramp the parts, weighing up to 500 kg, reached a trailer and were transported to the Archaeothiki.|$|E

Most existing systems rely on more traditional 2 D input devices such as mice and keyboards. Since augmented reality information is typically registered in 3 D to the environment, user interfaces need to be designed {{that are capable of}} supporting the more complex operations possible. This paper describes how we used metallic thread and <b>adhesive</b> <b>fabric</b> to add conduction sensing to a standard set of gloves which can survive harsh treatment; how Bluetooth and MSP 430 microcontrollers are used to build a small circuit that is wireless and highly portable; and how AR-ToolKit is used for 3 D tracking of fiducial markers on the thumbs. While we have previously demonstrated this technology with a number of our previous systems, this paper explains the various techniques we use in the implementation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An acute {{complication}} of thyroidectomy is fatal hematoma, which can produce an upper airway obstruction needing immediate intubation or tracheostomy. After neck surgery, we usually apply a pressure dressing with a non-woven, <b>adhesive</b> <b>fabric</b> to reduce bleeding and fluid {{collection at the}} operative bed. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate a pressure vs. a non-pressure dressing after thyroid surgery by monitoring blood and serum in the operative bed. Methods We studied 108 patients who underwent 116 thyroid surgeries at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, between December 2006 and September 2007. The patients were randomized to either the pressure dressing or non-pressure dressing group. Ultrasound of the neck was performed 24 ± 3 hours after surgery. The volume of fluid collection in the operative bed was calculated. All patients were observed for any post-operative respiratory distress, wound complications, tingling sensation or tetany. Results The distributions of age, sex, surgical indications and approaches were similar between the two groups. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the volume of fluid collection in the operative bed (p = 0. 150) and the collected drained content (p = 0. 798). The average time a drain was retained was 3 days. One patient in the pressure dressing group suffered cutaneous bruising while one patient in the non-pressure dressing group developed immediate hemorrhage after the skin sutures. Conclusion Pressure dressing after thyroidectomy does not have any significant impact on decreasing fluid collection at the operative bed. The use of pressure dressing after thyroidectomy may not therefore be justified. Trial Registration NCT 00400465, ISRCTN 52660978 </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{low power}} highly {{sensitive}} Thoracic Impedance Variance (TIV) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring SoC is designed and implemented into a poultice-like plaster sensor for wearable cardiac monitoring. 0. 1 TIV detection is possible with a sensitivity of 3. 17 V and SNR 40 dB. This is achieved {{with the help}} of a high quality (factor 30) balanced sinusoidal current source and low noise reconfigurable readout electronics. A cm-range 13. 56 MHz fabric inductor coupling is adopted to start/stop the SoC remotely. Moreover, a 5 % duty-cycled Body Channel Communication (BCC) is exploited for 0. 2 nJ/b 1 Mbps energy efficient external data communication. The proposed SoC occupies 5 mm 5 mm including pads in a standard 0. 18 m 1 P 6 M CMOS technology. It dissipates a peak power of 3. 9 mW when operating in body channel receiver mode, and consumes 2. 4 mW when operating in TIV and ECG detection mode. The SoC is integrated on a 15 cm 15 cm fabric circuit board together with a flexible battery to form a compact wearable sensor. With 25 <b>adhesive</b> screen-printed <b>fabric</b> electrodes, detection of TIV and ECG at 16 different sites of the heart is possible, allowing optimal detection sites to be configured to accommodate different user dependencies.

40|$|Nineteenth century {{trade union}} banners {{designed}} to be held aloft during outdoor parades and marches needed to withstand the necessary handling and punishment of the wind during use, and rolling for storage. They were frequently constructed from silk fabric and painted on both faces with oil based paints; their manufacture was a quest to impart flexibility to the painted areas of the silk to prolong their useful life span. On ageing, the most commonly encountered deterioration characteristic of painted banners is splitting and tearing of the silk fabric at the junction between the painted and non-painted regions, due to their differential flexibility. Conservation treatments to support the resultant splits, using <b>adhesive</b> coated <b>fabrics,</b> need to preserve the overall flexibility of the banners to acknowledge the integral characteristics of the artefacts. Moreover, the adhesive support mechanisms need to withstand the continued flexing of the banners during rolling and unrolling, handling and free hanging display. The paper will discuss how studying the manufacturing methods of two major 19 th century banner makers, using analytical techniques to supplement the scant surviving documentary sources, has enhanced {{understanding of how the}} flexibility of the banners was initially promoted. Subsequent degradation pathways of the materials and methods used were explored to understand how the original flexibility of banners may have altered. This in turn informed a recent evaluation of past conservation treatments of banners where adhesive techniques had been used. Understanding how the flexible quality of painted banners can influence the behaviour and success of conservation support methods, for example, the quantity and qualities of adhesive needed to endure long term rolled storage, can lead to the development of better remedial conservation techniques. <br/...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapidly}} {{advancing}} field of nanotechnology {{having an impact}} in several areas interfacing life and physical sciences, the potential applications of nano-particles as antimicrobial agents have been realized and offer great opportunities in addressing several viral and bacterial outbreak issues. Polyurethanes (PUs) are a diverse class of polymeric materials which also have applications in several areas of biomedical science ranging from blood contact devices to implantable dental technologies. In this report, copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (mean size $ 50 nm) are embedded into a PU matrix via two electrical fabrication processes. To elucidate the antimicrobial activity, a range of different loading compositions of CuO within the PU matrix (0 %, 1 %, 5 %, and 10 % w/w) are electrospun to form thin porous films (thickness< 10 mm). After washing, the films are tested for their antimicrobial properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Significant reduction of populations was demonstrated with 10 % w/w CuO over a 4 -h period. This approach demonstrates the potential of generating tailored antimicrobial structures {{for a host of}} applications, such as designer filters, patterned coatings, breathable <b>fabrics,</b> <b>adhesive</b> films (as opposed to sutures), and mechanically supporting structures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if selected contemporary quilting materials, specifically marking pens and ink removal treatments, quilt basting sprays, fusible webs, and fusible battings, contribute to the degradation or discoloration of quilt fabrics over time as there are no published results of the long-term effects of these products. Marked fabrics (marking pens) and fabric assemblies (fabric and batting) incorporating quilt basting spray adhesives, fusible webs, and fusible battings were evaluated for color differences and percent change in breaking strength following light exposure or accelerated ageing. <b>Fabric</b> assemblies containing <b>adhesive</b> products were also evaluated for changes in stiffness following light exposure or accelerated ageing. ^ Accelerated ageing to simulate natural ageing was performed according to AATCC modified protocols for 6 - and 36 -hour levels of accelerated ageing to predict the lifespan of quilting materials. Artificial light exposure in an Atlas Xenon-Arc Weather-Ometer simulated sunlight exposure through window glass. Marking pen specimens were exposed to 20 and 40 AFUs of light exposure, while <b>adhesive</b> product <b>fabric</b> assemblies were exposed to 40 and 80 AFUs of light. ^ Air-soluble marking pen ink did not “disappear” as manufacturers claimed. Water immersion was the most effect means of ink removal, while eraser pen ink removal treatments had the most dramatic and detrimental effect of color change. ^ Fusible battings exhibited less color change than other adhesive products. Some polyvinyl acetate-based adhesive sprays exhibited more yellowing than others. Both polyamide and polyvinyl alcohol-based fusible webs exhibited undesirable ageing characteristics. Knowing basic chemical classification of a product was not sufficient to predict product performance; additives negatively affect the performance of products during the ageing process. ^ The results promise to be useful to museum professionals. Based on this research, curators and conservators may wish to advise against acquisition of quilts, apparel or fiber art incorporating these products. Furthermore, this research indicates that quilters desiring to make heirlooms should refrain from using temporary fabric marking pens and select products without adhesives. ...|$|R
2500|$|The A-type was the {{original}} wing design, with eight [...]303 calibre Browning machine guns, with 300 rounds per gun (rpg). The basic structure of the wing was unchanged until the C type in 1942. The one major alteration made to this wing, soon after production started, was the incorporation of a heating system for the gun bays, to prevent the guns from freezing up at high altitudes. To achieve this, open structures, such as wing ribs, surrounding the gun-bays were closed off, forming closed bays for each gun. Ducting was added, which drew heated air from the engine radiator and transferred it into the now-closed weapon-bays. Underwing vents, covered by streamlined triangular blisters just inboard of the wingtips, extracted the air, creating a negative pressure differential, and caused more heated air to be drawn in, ensuring {{a steady supply of}} heated air without any need for a mechanical blower. To keep cold air from blowing in via the muzzle openings in the leading edge, they were sealed with red <b>fabric</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape by ground crew while loading the ammunition trays. The guns fired through the tape, so they were no longer sealed after combat. Towards the end of 1940, the fabric covered ailerons were replaced by ones covered in light alloy. The A-type wing was only compatible with the 8 × [...]303 Browning machine gun armament suite.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} trends in fatigue results from the Montana State University program on the fatigue of composite materials for wind turbine blades for the period 2005 - 2009. Test data {{can be found in}} the SNL/MSU/DOE Fatigue of Composite Materials Database which is updated annually. This is the fifth report in this series, which summarizes progress of the overall program since its inception in 1989. The primary thrust of this program has been research and testing of a broad range of structural laminate materials of interest to blade structures. The report is focused on current types of infused and prepreg blade materials, either processed in-house or by industry partners. Trends in static and fatigue performance are analyzed for a range of materials, geometries and loading conditions. Materials include: sixteen resins of three general types, five epoxy based paste <b>adhesives,</b> fifteen reinforcing <b>fabrics</b> including three fiber types, three prepregs, many laminate lay-ups and process variations. Significant differences in static and fatigue performance and delamination resistance are quantified for particular materials and process conditions. When blades do fail, the likely cause is fatigue in the structural detail areas or at major flaws. The program is focused strongly on these issues in addition to standard laminates. Structural detail tests allow evaluation of various blade materials options in the context of more realistic representations of blade structure than do the standard test methods. Types of structural details addressed in this report include ply drops used in thickness tapering, and adhesive joints, each tested over a range of fatigue loading conditions. Ply drop studies were in two areas: (1) a combined experimental and finite element study of basic ply drop delamination parameters for glass and carbon prepreg laminates, and (2) the development of a complex structured resin-infused coupon including ply drops, for comparison studies of various resins, fabrics and pry drop thicknesses. Adhesive joint tests using typical blade adhesives included both generic testing of materials parameters using a notched-lap-shear test geometry developed in this study, and also a series of simulated blade web joint geometries fabricated by an industry partner...|$|R
