50|$|<b>A</b> mutual <b>mistake</b> {{occurs when}} the parties to a {{contract}} are both mistaken about the same material fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is {{a meeting of the}} minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. Collateral mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. <b>A</b> collateral <b>mistake</b> is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For <b>a</b> mutual <b>mistake</b> to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be material (emphasis added). When there is <b>a</b> material <b>mistake</b> about <b>a</b> material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, {{there is the question of}} the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.|$|R

5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that strategy is <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E

Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot better than the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
