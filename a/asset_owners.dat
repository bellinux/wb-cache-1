40|$|I {{consider}} {{a model in}} which an <b>asset</b> <b>owner</b> must decide how much to invest in his asset mindful {{of the fact that}} an encroacher’s valuation of the asset is increasing in the <b>asset</b> <b>owner’s</b> investment. Due to incomplete property rights, the encroacher and <b>asset</b> <b>owner</b> engage in a contest over the control of the asset after investment has taken place. A standard result is that the <b>asset</b> <b>owner</b> will underinvest in the asset relative to the first-best level of investment when property rights are complete. Contrary to this standard result, I find that when the interaction between the <b>asset</b> <b>owner</b> and the encroacher is infinitely repeated and the encroacher has some bargaining power over the size of the transfer from the <b>asset</b> <b>owner</b> to him, then there is a cooperative equilibrium in which the <b>asset</b> <b>owner</b> finds it optimal to over-invest in the asset when property rights are incomplete relative to the first-best level of investment when property rights are complete. Overinvestment is used to induce cooperation. However, this result depends on the encroacher’s bargaining power or, more generally, whether the transfer is an increasing function of investment. contests, incomplete information, property rights, investment, transfers...|$|R

2500|$|Indications and Warnings (occurs before and/or {{during an}} event) - The Indications and Warnings phase {{involves}} daily sector monitoring {{to assess the}} mission assurance capabilities of critical infrastructure assets and {{to determine if there}} are event indications to report. [...] Indications are preparatory actions that indicate whether an infrastructure event is likely to occur or is planned. [...] Indications are based on input at the tactical, operational, theater, and strategic level. [...] At the tactical level, input comes from <b>asset</b> <b>owners.</b> At the operational level, input comes from the NDI sectors. [...] At the theater level, input comes from regional assets such as allied intelligence, NATO, command intelligence, allied governments, and coalition forces. [...] At the strategic level, input comes from intelligence, law-enforcement, and the private sector. [...] Warning is the process of notifying <b>asset</b> <b>owners</b> of a possible threat or hazard.|$|E

2500|$|During the Mitigation phase, DoD {{critical}} <b>asset</b> <b>owners,</b> DoD installations, and Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, {{work with}} the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) to develop, train for, and exercise mitigation responses for various scenarios. [...] When there is a warning, emergency, or infrastructure incident, the critical <b>asset</b> <b>owners,</b> installations, and Sector CIAOs initiate mitigation actions to sustain service to the DoD. They also provide mitigation status information to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. The NMCC monitors for consequences from an event within one Defense Infrastructure sector that are significant enough to affect other sectors. For events that cross two or more sectors, the NMCC advises on the prioritization and coordination of mitigation actions. When event threats or consequences continue to escalate, the NMCC directs mitigation actions by sector to ensure a coordinated response across the DoD. The NMCC and the JTF-CNO keep the National Infrastructure Protection Center, or NIPC, apprised of any significant mitigation activities.|$|E

[...] Through the CIP program, all critical assets have a baseline vulnerability index, which is calculated from inputs {{associated with the}} class of asset and geographic region such as the probability of natural disasters, criminal or national security events, and technological failures. [...] <b>Asset</b> <b>owners,</b> host installations, the sector CIAO, or other DoD entities may provide asset operational readiness and emergency preparedness information.|$|E
2500|$|When {{an event}} affects the Defense Infrastructure, the Incident Response phase begins. Incident Response {{is the fifth}} phase of the CIP life cycle. [...] The purpose of the Incident Response phase is to {{eliminate}} the cause or source of an infrastructure event. For example, during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, all non-military airplanes were grounded over the United States to prevent further incidents. [...] Response activities included emergency measures, not from the <b>asset</b> <b>owners</b> or operators, but from dedicated third parties such as law enforcement, medical rescue, fire rescue, hazardous material or explosives handling, and investigative agencies.

[...] JTF-CNO also requests and coordinates any support or assistance from other Federal agencies and civilian organizations during incidents affecting a DoD network. [...] When incidents impact any other DoD owned assets, installation commanders and critical <b>asset</b> <b>owners</b> follow traditional channels and procedures to coordinate responses. This includes notifying affected Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, in the initial notice and status reporting. [...] Although third parties {{play a major role}} in the response to Defense Infrastructure events, DoD CIP personnel also have responsibilities to fulfill.|$|E

[...] Critical <b>asset</b> <b>owners,</b> DoD installations, and Sector CIAOs monitor the infrastructure daily. Indications of an infrastructure incident are reported to the National Military Command Center, or NMCC. [...] If indications are on a computer network, they are also reported to the Joint Task Force Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). [...] The NMCC and JTF-CNO assess the indications and pass them to the NIPC and appropriate DoD organizations. [...] When the NIPC determines that an infrastructure event is likely to occur, is planned, or is under way, it issues a national warning. For DoD, the NIPC passes its warnings and alerts to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. [...] These warnings and alerts are then passed to the DoD components. The warning may include guidance regarding additional protection measures DoD should take.|$|E
