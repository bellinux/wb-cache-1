5|$|Electricity power {{stations}} are often {{located on the}} coast or beside an estuary so that the sea {{can be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive nuclear power plants in particular.|$|E

5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E

5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E

5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> in electronics.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. <b>A</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|E

25|$|In general, <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> {{performance}} {{is a function}} of material thermal conductivity, dimensions, fin type, heat transfer coefficient, air flow rate, and duct size. To determine the thermal performance of <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> a theoretical model can be made. Alternatively, the thermal performance can be measured experimentally. Due to the complex nature of the highly 3D flow in present applications, numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can also be used. This section will discuss the aforementioned methods for the determination of the heat sink thermal performance.|$|E
25|$|The CPU chips of {{the first}} and second {{generation}} Raspberry Pi board did not require cooling, such as <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> unless the chip was overclocked, but the Raspberry Pi2 SoC may heat more than usual under overclocking.|$|E

50|$|Without proper cooling, {{a modern}} {{processor}} chip can rapidly reach temperatures that {{cause it to}} malfunction. Even with <b>a</b> common <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> and fan attached, typical processor operating temperatures may still reach up to 70 °C (160 °F). A thermosiphon can efficiently transfer <b>heat</b> over <b>a</b> much wider temperature range and can typically maintain the processor temperature 10-20 °C cooler than <b>a</b> traditional <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> and fan.
