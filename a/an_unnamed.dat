5|$|As {{currently}} defined, the Atlantic {{hurricane season}} lasts from June1 to November30, {{the period in}} which tropical cyclones are most likely to develop across the basin. Occasionally, systems develop outside the season, most frequently in May or December. Activity in January is considered extremely rare, with only five other known instances since 1851: <b>an</b> <b>unnamed</b> hurricane in 1938, <b>an</b> <b>unnamed</b> tropical storm in 1951, Hurricane Alice in 1954–55, <b>an</b> <b>unnamed</b> storm in 1978, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–06. Since Alice originated in December1954, Alex is only the second hurricane to develop solely within January, after the 1938 storm. When Alex made landfall on Terceira as a strong tropical storm this marked only the second time that an Atlantic tropical cyclone has made landfall in January, with the other being Hurricane Alice of 1955 which made landfall on Saint Martin and Saba. In addition to forming well outside of hurricane season, Alex developed unusually far north and east, becoming only the second hurricane to form north of 30°N and east of 30°W.|$|E

5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one.

Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E
