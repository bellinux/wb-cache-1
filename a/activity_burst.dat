Moreover, the results can be separated into cases depending on those tail indices. In one case where all distributions are heavy tailed it is shown that the limiting result is Brownian motion.

P-cresol, a prototype protein-bound uraemic retention solute, has been shown to exert toxic effects in vitro. Recently, however, it has been demon-strated that p-cresol in the human body is conjugated, with p-cresylsulphate as the main metabolite. Methods. The present study evaluates the effect of p-cresylsulphate on the respiratory <b>burst</b> <b>activity</b> of leucocytes. Results. P-cresylsulphate significantly increased the percentage of leucocytes displaying oxidative <b>burst</b> <b>activity</b> at baseline.

40|$|The {{capacities}} of animals for <b>activity</b> (<b>burst</b> speed, maximal exertion, endur-ance) are examined {{in relation to}} their selective importance in extant populations and the pattern of their evolution in major animal taxa. Activity capacities have been demonstrated to be both heritable and highly variable in natural populations and hence susceptible to natural selection. Some field studies have demonstrated significant positive associations between activity capacities, particularly burst speed, and survivorship; other studies have not. The potential for such selection therefore clearly exists, although it may not operate in all populations. Comparative studies of major taxa have linked endurance capacities to maximal rates of oxygen consumption; speed and exertion are correlated with capacities for anaerobic metabolism, either the catabolism of phosphagens or the production of lactic acid or octopine, depending on taxon. In vertebrates, the primitive metabolic pattern involved the use of aerobic metabolism to support moderate swimming performance, supplemented by bursts of activity fuelled through lactic acid production. Because of much greater locomotor costs, the transition of vertebrates onto land entailed a decrease in endurance, which was greatly expanded again only after the evolution of the higher rates of aerobic metabolism characteristic of the birds and mammals. These greater aerobic capacities may have been selected for thermoregulatory reasons and/or for increased activity capacity itself...|$|E

To test these hypotheses, we assessed, in recreationally active women, 12 with amenorrhea (ExFHA; aged 25 ± 1 years; body mass index 20. 7 ± 0. 7 kg/m(2); mean ± SEM) and 17 with eumenorrhea (ExOv; 24 ± 1 years; 20. 9 ± 0. 5 kg/m(2)), blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity at supine rest and during graded lower body negative pressure (- 10, - 20, and - 40 mm[*]Hg).

30|$|One {{familiar}} {{example of}} a non-standard respiratory output pattern is the sigh. Sighs can be distinguished in neuronal activity; indeed, recordings of population activity from the ventral respiratory group (VRG) identified two distinct patterns of inspiratory activity under conditions of normal oxygenation: fictive eupnea (typical respiration) and low-frequency fictive sighs. As described by [6], fictive sighs occur periodically in the in vitro transverse medullary slice preparation from mice containing the pre-BötC within the VRG. Each fictive sigh consists of a biphasic <b>activity</b> <b>burst</b> that is larger in amplitude, longer in duration, and occurs at a lower frequency than eupneic bursts. Despite the experimental accessibility of sighs, the rhythmogenic mechanisms underlying sigh generation remain largely unknown [6, 7]. The biphasic aspect of the sigh, with an initial phase that is identical to a normal eupneic burst and a later high-amplitude phase, could result from the recruitment of a neuronal population distinct from the eupneic rhythm-generating circuit, or it could simply emerge due to the complex interplay of multiple-timescale processes within the core rhythm-generating circuit itself. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to use mathematical tools to elucidate the multiple-timescale mechanisms underlying sigh generation in two recent computational models [8, 9], one of which represents each of the competing hypotheses about pattern generation. In doing so, we will highlight the ways in which the dynamic mechanisms in the two models are in fact similar as well as ways that they can be distinguished in future experimental studies, to help determine whether or not separate pattern generating components complement rhythm generators in producing respiratory outputs.|$|E

In the first one, male Wistar rats (n = 48) were fed a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) for 3 wk and then a high-fat diet (HFD) for the next 3 wk. This study showed that adiposity gain under HCD was 2. 9 -fold larger in carbohydrate-sensitive (CS) than in carbohydrate-resistant (CR) rats, confirming the concept of "carbohydrate-sensitive" rats. Energy expenditure (EE), respiratory quotient (RQ), caloric intake (CI), and locomotor activity measured during HFD identified no differences in EE and RQ between fat-resistant (FR) and fat-sensitive (FS) rats, and indicated that obesity developed in FS rats only as the result of a larger CI not fully compensated by a parallel increase in EE. A specific pattern of spontaneous activity, characterized by reduced <b>activity</b> <b>burst</b> intensity, was identified in FS rats but not in CS ones. This mirrors a previous observation that under HCD, CS but not FS rats, exhibited bursts of activity of reduced intensity.

40|$|Abstract—As humans age, the tonic {{level of}} {{activity}} in sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves increases and may contribute to age-related increases in blood pressure. In previous studies in normotensive young men with varying levels of resting sympathetic nerve activity, we observed a balance among factors contributing to blood pressure regulation, such that higher sympathetic activity was associated with lower cardiac output and lesser vascular responsiveness to -adrenergic agonists, which limited the impact of high sympathetic activity on blood pressure. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that older normotensive men would exhibit a similar balance among these variables (sympathetic nerve activity, cardiac output, and -adrenergic responsiveness) but that this balance would be shifted toward higher sympathetic nerve activity values. We measured muscle sympathetic nerve activity, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and forearm vasoconstrictor responses in 17 older men and compared these with previous data collected in 14 younger men. Muscle sympathetic <b>activity</b> (<b>burst</b> incidence) {{was positively related to}} diastolic blood pressure in the older men (r 0. 49; P 0. 05); this relationship was not observed in young men.

METHODS: Surface electromyography (EMG) and cough flow rate were measured in 10 healthy volunteers. Voluntary cough was assessed for 20 efforts in each quintile of increasing cough flow rate. Reflex cough was assessed for 25 efforts produced by nebulised l-tartaric acid. EMG was recorded over the expiratory (rectus abdominis, obliques, lower intercostals) and accessory (trapezius, pectoralis major, deltoid, latissimus dorsi) muscles. EMG <b>activity,</b> <b>burst</b> duration and onset were compared for each quintile of voluntary cough, and between voluntary and reflex cough matched for cough flow rate. RESULTS: EMG activity and burst duration of expiratory and accessory muscles during voluntary cough increased {{in proportion to}} cough flow. Expiratory muscles had longer EMG burst duration (difference 68 ms (95 % CI 34 to 102), p< 0. 01) and earlier onset of EMG activity (difference 44 ms (95 % CI 20 to 68), p< 0. 0001) compared with accessory muscles. EMG activity in all muscles was increased (mean 110. 2 % v 56. 1 %, p< 0. 001) and burst duration (mean 206 ms v 280 ms, p = 0. 013) decreased in reflex cough compared with voluntary cough of equal flow rate. There were no differences in EMG onset (difference 8 ms (95 % CI 25 to - 9) or burst duration (difference 27 ms (95 % CI 58 to - 4) between expiratory and accessory muscles.

We found that muscle sympathetic nerve <b>activity</b> <b>burst</b> frequency was similar between blacks and whites in the supine position (44 [10] versus 42 [7] bursts per minute) and during upright tilt (59 [11] versus 60 [9] bursts per minute; P 0. 846 for race, P 0. 001 for posture, and P 0. 622 for interaction). However, upright total muscle sympathetic nerve activity was smaller in blacks than in whites (162 [39] versus 243 [112]%; P 0. 003). Systolic BP, heart rate, cardiac output, and stroke volume were not different between groups. Diastolic BP was similar in the supine position, increased in all of the subjects during tilting; upright diastolic BP was greater in blacks than in whites (80 [10] versus 71 [7] mmHg; P 0. 008). Total peripheral resistance did not differ between blacks and whites in the supine position or during upright tilt (P 0. 354 for race, P 0. 001 for posture, P 0. 825 for interaction). Thus, elderly blacks have a blunted sympathetic neural responsiveness but enhanced pressor response to orthostasis compared with elderly whites, which may be attributable to an augmented sympathetic vascular transduction and/or nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNeurodegenerative and {{neurological}} disorders are often characterised by pathological changes to dendrites, {{in advance of}} neuronal death. Oxidative stress, energy deficits and excitotoxicity are implicated in many such disorders, suggesting a potential vulnerability of dendrites to these situations. Here we have studied dendritic vs. somatic responses of primary cortical neurons to these types of challenges in real-time. Using a genetically encoded indicator of intracellular redox potential (Grx 1 -roGFP 2) we found that, compared to the soma, dendritic regions exhibited more dramatic fluctuations in redox potential in response to sub-lethal ROS exposure, and existed in a basally more oxidised state. We also studied the responses of dendritic and somatic regions to excitotoxic NMDA receptor activity. Both dendritic and somatic regions experienced similar increases in cytoplasmic Ca 2 +. Interestingly, while mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake and initial mitochondrial depolarisation were similar in both regions, secondary delayed mitochondrial depolarisation was far weaker in dendrites, potentially {{as a result of}} less NADH depletion. Despite this, ATP levels were found to fall faster in dendritic regions. Finally we studied the responses of dendritic and somatic regions to energetically demanding action potential burst <b>activity.</b> <b>Burst</b> activity triggered PDH dephosphorylation, increases in oxygen consumption and cellular NADH:NAD ratio. Compared to somatic regions, dendritic regions exhibited a smaller degree of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake, lower fold-induction of NADH and larger reduction in ATP levels. Collectively, these data reveal that dendritic regions of primary neurons are vulnerable to greater energetic and redox fluctuations than the cell body, which may contribute to disease-associated dendritic damage.

40|$|Abstract—Within an individual, diastolic blood {{pressure}} (DBP) is negatively related to sympathetic burst incidence, such that lower pressure is associated with high burst incidence. Our goal was to explore {{the use of a}} calculation of a DBP “error signal ” in the control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in men and women. Baseline muscle sympathetic nerve activity was measured in healthy young men (n 22) and women (n 28). Women had significantly lower muscle sympathetic nerve activity than men (293 versus 432 bursts per 100 heartbeats; P 0. 05). For each individual, the DBP at which there is a 50 % likelihood of a muscle sympathetic nerve <b>activity</b> <b>burst,</b> the “T 50 ” value, was calculated. Mean DBP was subtracted from the T 50 {{blood pressure}} as an approximate error signal for burst activation. Error signal was negative in both sexes, indicating that DBP in both sexes was higher than the DBP value associated with a 50 % burst likelihood. However, average error signal was significantly larger in women (42 mm Hg) than in men (10 mm Hg; P 0. 05 versus women). We conclude that women operate at a mean DBP greater than their T 50 compared with men, and this may be a contributing factor to low basal muscle sympathetic nerve activity in women. The relationship between error signal and burst incidence may provide important insight into the control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity across sexes and in various populations.

40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are characterized}} by repetitive synchronous neuronal <b>bursting</b> <b>activity.</b> To study external influences on this activity, a simple model of a chain loop of neuronal networks has been developed {{with the goal of}} understanding how external stimuli can contribute to reduction or cessation of such abnormal recurrent <b>bursting</b> <b>activity.</b> Using this simulated loop model, one can demonstrate that an external stimulus that normally can initiate repetitive activity can terminate the <b>bursting</b> <b>activity</b> when applied to a chain loop of sub-networks, which has actively propagating bursts. The ability of external currents to terminate activity is dependent upon loop length and the timing of the applied external stimulus. Termination of propagation in long loops (40 - 64 sub-networks in this model) requires application of multiple simultaneous stimuli to different sub-networks...|$|R
40|$|Dense monolayers {{of living}} cells display {{intriguing}} relaxation dynamics, reminiscent of soft and glassy materials {{close to the}} jamming transition, and migrate collectively when space is available, as in wound healing or in cancer invasion. Here we show that collective cell migration occurs in bursts {{that are similar to}} those recorded in the propagation of cracks, fluid fronts in porous media and ferromagnetic domain walls. In analogy with these systems, the distribution of <b>activity</b> <b>bursts</b> displays scaling laws that are universal in different cell types and for cells moving on different substrates. The main features of the invasion dynamics are quantitatively captured by a model of interacting active particles moving in a disordered landscape. Our results illustrate that collective motion of living cells is analogous to the corresponding dynamics in driven, but inanimate, systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{connections}} between excitatory and inhibitory synapses are significant for generation of busting activity in a pyramidal neuron model. We have suggested {{in previous studies}} that a reduced neuronal model of synaptically connected neurons could produce repetitive <b>bursting</b> <b>activity.</b> We have also suggested that the modification of the balance between inhibition and excitation by synaptic weight could alter the excitability of neuronal networks. In this computational study, we have investigated {{the role of the}} relative locations of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on the dendritic tree and soma in the generation of <b>bursting</b> <b>activity.</b> We have built a reduced pyramidal neuron model of synaptically connected neurons using the simulation software GENESIS. Our model consists of three reduced pyramidal neurons and an inhibitory interneuron. Simulations show that a reduced pyramidal neuron model can accurately replicate bursting behavior. This <b>bursting</b> <b>activity</b> depends upon the synaptic parameters represented by synaptic weight and delay as well as the locations of synaptic inputs. Simulations with an interneuron show that the inhibitory interneuron regulates neuronal <b>bursting</b> <b>activity.</b> The inhibitory effect is stronger when the inhibitory synapse is close to the soma...|$|R
