5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of <b>adiabatic</b> invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same <b>adiabatic</b> principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an <b>adiabatic</b> invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this <b>adiabatic</b> invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paramagnetic}} crystal salts of dysprosium (Dysprosium Gallium Garnet, DGG; Dysprosium Aluminum Garnet, DAG; Dysprosium Iron Garnet, DyIG) {{are used}} in <b>adiabatic</b> demagnetization refrigerators.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to <b>adiabatic</b> cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|He {{articulated}} {{the principle of}} relativity. This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence, general covariance and the principle of <b>adiabatic</b> invariance of the quantum number.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: <b>adiabatic</b> cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. <b>Adiabatic</b> cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in <b>adiabatic</b> cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in <b>adiabatic</b> cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a period of <b>adiabatic</b> expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000years.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and <b>adiabatic</b> quantum computation. The maximum clique problem {{was the subject of}} an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992–1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge is publicly available.|$|E
5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the <b>adiabatic</b> lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
25|$|Surface hopping {{accounts}} for these limitations by propagating an ensemble of trajectories, {{each one of}} them on a single <b>adiabatic</b> surface at any given time. The trajectories are allowed to 'hop' between various <b>adiabatic</b> states at certain times such that the quantum amplitudes for the <b>adiabatic</b> states follow the time dependent Schrödinger equation. The probability of these hops are dependent on the coupling between the states, and is generally significant only in the regions where the difference between <b>adiabatic</b> energies is small.|$|E
25|$|In an <b>adiabatic</b> process, {{there is}} {{transfer}} of energy as work {{but not as}} heat. For all <b>adiabatic</b> process that takes a system from a given initial state to a given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work {{are one and the}} same, determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, <b>adiabatic</b> transfer of energy as work requires the existence of <b>adiabatic</b> enclosures.|$|E
25|$|In thermodynamics, an <b>adiabatic</b> {{process is}} a change that occurs without heat flow, and slowly {{compared}} to the time to reach equilibrium. In an <b>adiabatic</b> process, the system is in equilibrium at all stages. Under these conditions, the entropy is constant.|$|E
25|$|In mechanics, an <b>adiabatic</b> {{change is}} a slow {{deformation}} of the Hamiltonian, where the fractional rate of change of the energy is much slower than the orbital frequency. The area enclosed by the different motions in phase space are the <b>adiabatic</b> invariants.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, an <b>adiabatic</b> {{change is}} one that occurs at a rate much slower than the {{difference}} in frequency between energy eigenstates. In this case, the energy states of the system do not make transitions, so that the quantum number is an <b>adiabatic</b> invariant.|$|E
25|$|For {{a closed}} system, in any {{arbitrary}} process {{of interest that}} takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, the change of internal energy {{is the same as}} that for a reference <b>adiabatic</b> work process that links those two states. This is so regardless of the path of the process of interest, and regardless of whether it is an <b>adiabatic</b> or a non-adiabatic process. The reference <b>adiabatic</b> work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes.|$|E
25|$|In thermodynamics, <b>adiabatic</b> {{changes are}} {{those that do not}} {{increase}} the entropy. They occur slowly in comparison to the other characteristic timescales of the system of interest, and allow heat flow only between objects at the same temperature. For isolated systems, an <b>adiabatic</b> change allows no heat to flow in or out.|$|E
25|$|In {{plasma physics}} {{there are three}} <b>adiabatic</b> invariants of charged {{particle}} motion.|$|E
25|$|This {{enthalpy}} is lower. The <b>adiabatic</b> reversible turbine work = H-H.|$|E
25|$|The Chinook is a föhn wind, a rain shadow wind {{which results}} from the {{subsequent}} <b>adiabatic</b> warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (orographic lift). As {{a consequence of the}} different <b>adiabatic</b> rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes.|$|E
25|$|When evaluated, the {{isothermal}} work {{is found}} to be lower than the <b>adiabatic</b> work.|$|E
25|$|In gases, <b>adiabatic</b> {{compressibility}} {{is directly}} related to pressure through the heat capacity ratio (<b>adiabatic</b> index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of temperature and molecular structure important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).|$|E
25|$|<b>Adiabatic</b> flame; i.e., {{no loss of}} heat to the {{atmosphere}} (may differ in certain parts).|$|E
25|$|As moist winds {{from the}} Pacific (also called “Chinooks”) {{are forced to}} rise over the mountains, the {{moisture}} in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, while the air cools at the moist <b>adiabatic</b> rate of 5°C/1000m (3.5°F/1000ft). The dried air then descends on the leeward side of the mountains, warming at the dry <b>adiabatic</b> rate of 10°C/1000m (5.5°F/1000ft).|$|E
25|$|An <b>adiabatic</b> {{invariant}} is {{a property}} {{of a physical}} system that stays constant when changes occur slowly.|$|E
25|$|Temperature of {{atmosphere}} links to <b>adiabatic</b> flame temperature (i.e., heat will {{transfer to a}} cooler atmosphere more quickly).|$|E
25|$|Polytropic - This model {{takes into}} account both a rise in {{temperature}} in the gas {{as well as some}} loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above <b>adiabatic</b> (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (<b>adiabatic)</b> vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately <b>adiabatic</b> process, the value of n will be between 1 and k.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulation}} {{described here}} {{is in the}} <b>adiabatic</b> representation for simplicity. It can easily be generalized to a different representation.|$|E
25|$|To tackle this issue, one {{approach}} is the mean field or Ehrenfest method, where the molecular dynamics is run on the average potential energy surface given by a linear combination of the <b>adiabatic</b> states. This was applied successfully for some applications, but has some important limitations. When {{the difference between the}} <b>adiabatic</b> states is large, then the dynamics must be primarily driven by only one surface, and not an average potential. In addition, this method also violates the principle of microscopic reversibility.|$|E
25|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of some superchargers is lower <b>adiabatic</b> efficiency {{when compared with}} turbochargers (especially Roots-type superchargers). <b>Adiabatic</b> efficiency {{is a measure of}} a compressor's ability to compress air without adding excess heat to that air. Even under ideal conditions, the compression process always results in elevated output temperature; however, more efficient compressors produce less excess heat. Roots superchargers impart significantly more heat to the air than turbochargers. Thus, for a given volume and pressure of air, the turbocharged air is cooler, and as a result denser, containing more oxygen molecules, and therefore more potential power than the supercharged air. In practical application the disparity between the two can be dramatic, with turbochargers often producing 15% to 30% more power based solely on the differences in <b>adiabatic</b> efficiency (however, due to heat transfer from the hot exhaust, considerable heating does occur).|$|E
25|$|The CMB {{spectrum}} {{can distinguish}} {{between these two}} because {{these two types of}} perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (l values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while <b>adiabatic</b> density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:... Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely <b>adiabatic,</b> providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} between temperature and compression ratio described above {{means that the}} value of n for an <b>adiabatic</b> process is k (the ratio of specific heats).|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{additives}} {{can also}} get into the breathing mix if any material inside the blending valves or pipes burns, for instance when <b>adiabatic</b> heating occurs when decanting or boosting oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The quantum {{can only}} {{depend on the}} energy/frequency by <b>adiabatic</b> invariance, and since the energy must be {{additive}} when putting boxes end to end, the levels must be equally spaced.|$|E
25|$|So entropy is an <b>adiabatic</b> invariant. The Nlog(N) term {{makes the}} entropy additive, so {{the entropy of}} two volumes of gas {{is the sum of}} the entropies of each one.|$|E
25|$|The European Union-funded RICAS 2020 (<b>adiabatic)</b> {{project in}} Austria uses crushed rock to store {{heat from the}} {{compression}} process to improve efficiency. The system was expected to achieve 70-80% efficiency.|$|E
