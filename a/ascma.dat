40|$|International audienceAn {{adaptive}} Analytical Simplified Constant Modulus Algorithm (adaptive-ASCMA) which accomplishes blind source {{separation and}} carrier phase recovery is proposed. This algorithm is applied on Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication systems and uses some analytical methods {{to minimize the}} Simplified Constant Modulus (SCM) cost function. A study was done to find the subspace containing {{the solution of the}} minimization problem. With comparable computational complexities, the adaptive <b>ASCMA</b> accomplishes better performances in Bit Error Rate (BER) and Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) terms than the adaptive-ACMA with time varying environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} blind multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) demodulation of communication signals, with time-varying channels and in an interception context. A new adaptive-blind source separation algorithm, {{which is based on}} the implementation of the MultiModulus cost function by analytical methods, is proposed. First a batch processing analysis is performed; Then an adaptive implementation of the AMMA (Analytical Multi-Modulus Algorithm) and its simplified version named <b>ASCMA</b> (Analytical Simplified Constant Modulus Algorithm) are detailed. These algorithms, named adaptive-AMMA and adaptive-ASCMA respectively are compared with the adaptive- ACMA (Analytical Constant Modulus Algorithm) and the MMA (Multi-Modulus Algorithm). The adaptive-AMMA and adaptive-ASCMA achieve a lower residual intersymbol interference and bit error rate than those of the adaptive-ACMA and MMA...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate whether}} levels of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (<b>ASCMA)</b> in human sera, a marker for several autoimmune diseases, correlate with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ASCMA-IgA,-IgG and-IgM levels were measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in patients with RA (n = 30) and 152 healthy adult controls. ASCMA-IgA prevalence was significantly higher in RA patients (40 %) than in healthy subjects (5. 3 %). A strong correlation between levels of ASCMA-IgA and CRP (r = 0. 695; p < 0. 01) and ESR (r = 0. 708; p < 0. 01) in RA patients was observed. No significant differences in ASCMA-IgG or IgM levels were noted between RA patients and healthy control subjects in the present study. This result differs from previous reports. It remains to be evaluated whether elevated ASCMA-levels are common to all rheumatic disorders. Cellular & Molecular Immunology. 2009; 6 (5) : 361 - 366...|$|E
