5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs.

In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico <b>and</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

He founded the first Spanish port upon the Caribbean coast, Puerto de Caballos, which became an important staging post for later expeditions. The early decades of the Spanish conquest of Honduras were beset by jurisdictional disputes between different Spanish colonies attempting to invade the territory, which resulted in conflict between rival expeditions launched from Mexico, Hispaniola, and Panama. The Spanish territory was reorganised as Higueras in the west, and Honduras in the east. As the Spanish became established throughout Central America, the colony of Honduras-Higueras became involved in territorial disputes with neighbouring colonies in Nicaragua, Guatemala <b>and</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador.</b>|$|E

5|$|Late on June2, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{highlighted}} {{the potential for}} an {{area of low pressure}} to form well south of the coasts of Guatemala <b>and</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> over subsequent days. This forecast came to fruition early on June7, when shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase in association with a trough south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Steered steadily northwestward by a subtropical ridge, the disturbance acquired organized, deep convection near the center, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a tropical depression at 18:00UTC on June10. Following the formation of a spiral band that wrapped more than half way around the center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carlos at 12:00UTC the following day while positioned about 230miles (370km) south of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
