In the US, The N did broadcast the episodes as an hour-long special, on 7 October 2005. The N proceeded to broadcast the next ten episodes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> the season on hiatus until 7 April 2006, when it returned with another hour-long special.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did {{not survive}} the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 went down with her when she sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half, and within 13 seconds they had scored {{to lead the}} match 3–0. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked {{the ball into the}} Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> the ball into the Bayern goal with his left foot. Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed the ball into the Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match to reduce the deficit to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> {{his hands on his}} hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, and it was one of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.|$|E

During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> {{his hands on his}} hips. During the 15 minutes before the tea break, Bradman did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd for his lack of scoring. The Australian captain reached the tea break on 78; 55 minutes after the resumption of play he played a cover drive against Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes.

Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 4/293, a lead of 128.|$|E

25|$|The {{defining}} {{aspect of}} this type of game is the use of wooden blocks for the units. These are tilted on their side normally, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> down for combat. Until combat occurs, the opponent can see how many units are where, but not what type and what strength, introducing fog of war aspects. The blocks are also rotated to show different strength values in a step-reduction system.|$|E

In the second half Pelé outshone everyone, notching up two goals, including the first one where he lobbed the ball over Bengt Gustavsson then followed it with a precise volley shot. Zagallo added a goal in between, and Sweden managed a consolation goal.|$|E

Development started shortly after Earthworm Jim 2 in 1996, and had a drawn-out three year development cycle, so much so that it was at times believed it would become vaporware.|$|E
25|$|Four days later, Spurs {{returned}} to FA Cup action {{with the home}} replay against Fulham. Midway through the first-half, Fulham took the lead through a fine strike from ex-Tottenham player Bobby Zamora. Spurs rung the changes at half-time, making two substitutions and one immediately paid off, as the newly introduced David Bentley scored a free-kick to equalise the game. Tottenham took the lead ten minutes later through a Roman Pavlyuchenko volley <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> their name in the semi-final draw when Eiður Guðjohnsen squeezed home the third Spurs goal of the game.|$|E
