5000|$|A {{very capable}} astronomer, Oriani's work began to attract {{considerable}} attention. [...] His {{research in the}} areas of <b>astronomic</b> <b>refraction,</b> the obliquity of the ecliptic and orbital theory were of considerable noteworthiness in themselves; but his greatest achievement was his detailed research of the planet Uranus, which had been discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. Oriani devoted significant time to observations of Uranus, calculating its orbital properties, which he published as a booklet of tables in 1793.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} both author’s {{independent research}} and joint, with other scientists, studies of atmospheric {{influences on the}} results of angular and electronic distance measurements in polar regions and, in particular, in Antarctica. A short description of structure peculiarities of atmospheric boundary layer is given. A special attention was given to thermal stratification and caused by it influences {{on the results of}} astrogeodetic measurements. Investigation of <b>astronomic</b> <b>refraction</b> was conducted on the basis of aerological data. An integral of refraction was computed at different zenith angles for several Antarctic and Arctic stations. Refractive anomalies were calculated by means of refraction tables. The results of the theoretical and experimental investigations of the terrestrial vertical refraction in polar regions are given. Analysis of atmospheric influences on the electronic distance measurements were carried out by means of the refraction index calculation for light-and radio waves. The data of aerological soundings and meteorological gradients in the lowest atmospheric layers were used as initial materials. It should be noted that microwave distance measurements in Central Antarctica ensure a reliable accuracy in consequence of the very small air humidity. As regards the electronic distance measurements to satellites the existent models do not quite ensure the reliable results for laser- and microwave distance measurements in consequence of peculiarities of the meteorological parameter distributions in atmospheric lower layers in polar regions and in Central Antarctica, in particular. 1...|$|E
