30|$|The Norm Analysis Method {{supports}} the specification {{of the dynamic}} behavior related to those affordances. The Norm Analysis Method consists of four steps for eliciting and formalizing norms: responsibility analysis, protonorm analysis, trigger analysis and detailed dynamic behavior specification (cf. [17]). Each step assists the identification of parts of the norm. In particular, responsibility analysis aims at assigning the <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> each action. Trigger analysis focuses on the conditions that should happen and thus the action that will be performed.|$|R
25|$|From February, 1889, to May, 1892, Thayer {{was out of}} railway {{work before}} {{returning}} to the PRR in May, 1892, as division freight agent of the Northern Central, with headquarters at Baltimore, MD. On December 1, 1894, he was promoted to assistant general freight agent, with office at Philadelphia, Pa., and in March, 1897, was made general freight <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> through traffic. In May,1899, he was appointed general freight agent also of the Northern Central, the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore, and the West Jersey & Seashore. Thayer was elected fifth vice-president, in charge of traffic of the Pennsylvania Railroad on June 1, 1903.|$|E
25|$|The FBI, which {{continues}} to investigate the theft, has said {{it is no longer}} interested in identifying the thieves as the statute of limitations on the crime expired in 1996 and no one can be prosecuted for it (although those knowingly in possession of the stolen works could still be charged for that offense). However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with the FBI <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E
25|$|The Espionage Section was {{abolished}} in May 1945 after V-E Day. After the war, Felt {{was sent}} again {{to a field}} office, first to Seattle, Washington. After two years of general work, he spent two years as a firearms instructor and was promoted from agent to supervisor. Upon passage of the Atomic Energy Act {{and the creation of}} the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the Seattle office became responsible for completing background checks of workers at the Hanford plutonium plant near Richland, Washington. Felt oversaw these checks. In 1954, Felt returned briefly to Washington as an inspector's aide. Two months later, he was sent to New Orleans, Louisiana, as assistant special <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the field office. When he was transferred to Los Angeles, California, fifteen months later, he held the same rank there.|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Daniel C. Roper {{created the}} Intelligence Unit to {{investigate}} widespread allegations of tax fraud.

This somewhat scholarly research was undertaken by the US State Department's Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The OIR produced a 50-page report after five months of work; the State Department considered it the [...] "definitive answer" [...] {{to the question of how}} communism had arisen in Guatemala.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in title V, and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. Title V allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a Special <b>Agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> a Bureau field office, where previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI were able to certify such requests.|$|E

[...] The <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> SOE Africa station submitted a report to the head of SOE Colin Gubbins reflecting on the success of Postmaster: [...] "perhaps next time it will not be necessary for prolonged negotiations before undertaking a 30 minute operation." ...|$|E
500|$|The fugitives then {{continued}} southward, stopping before dawn on April 15 {{for treatment of}} Booth's injured leg {{at the home of}} Dr. Samuel Mudd, St. Catharine, [...] from Washington. Mudd later said that Booth told him the injury occurred when his horse fell. The next day, Booth and Herold arrived at the home of Samuel Cox around 4a.m. As the two fugitives hid in the woods nearby, Cox contacted Thomas A. Jones, his foster brother and a Confederate <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> spy operations in the southern Maryland area since 1862. The War Department advertised a $100,000reward ($ in [...] USD) by order of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his accomplices, and Federal troops were dispatched to search southern Maryland extensively, following tips reported by Federal intelligence agents to Col. Lafayette Baker.|$|E

50|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHISTORY had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the USIA was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use.|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of sub-district {{government in the}} decentralization era has been essentially altered.

Since the ‘big bang 2 ̆ 7 decentralization of 1999, however, it was incorporated {{to be a part}} of local government 2 ̆ 7 s bodies. The new pattern of sub-district, certainly, will lead to the needs to rearrange its organizational design and authority. Unfortunately, there is insufficient regulation from central government providing comprehensive guidance and methods on how to revitalize the role, structure and authority of sub-district government. Considering the situation, this paper proposes some alternative options which might be well implemented for creating new configuration of sub-district government...|$|R
