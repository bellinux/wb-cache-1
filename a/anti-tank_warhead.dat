25|$|The Panzerfaust 3's name {{dates back}} to the Panzerfaust used by the German army in World War II, which {{consisted}} of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead,</b> operated by a single soldier.|$|E
25|$|Man-portable {{anti-tank}} systems (MANPATS or MPATS) are shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets. They {{are typically}} unguided weapons {{and are a}} threat to armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft (especially helicopters), and field fortifications. Generally MANPATS fall into three distinct categories. The first consist of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> operated by a single soldier. The second is a firing system onto /into which a rocket is loaded, operated by a single soldier. The third are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use.|$|E
500|$|The turrets were {{designed}} to mount the 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun. Combined with the Turmzielfernrohr 9d (German [...] "turret telescopic sight") monocular sight by Leitz, which {{all but a few}} early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first round hit on a [...] high, [...] wide target only dropped below 100 percent at ranges beyond , to 95–97 percent at [...] and 85–87 percent at , depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000m, in the 60s at 1,500m and the 40s at 2,000m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was [...] at [...] and [...] respectively for the Panzergranate 39/43 projectile (PzGr—armour-piercing shell), and [...] for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The Sprenggranate 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the Hohlgranate or Hohlgeschoss 39 (HlGr—HEAT or High-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead)</b> round, which had [...] penetration at any range, {{could be used as a}} dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.|$|E
50|$|High-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> (HEAT for short) were {{developed}} during the Second World War as a munition made of an explosive shaped charge that uses the Munroe effect to create a very high-velocity partial stream of metal {{in a state of}} superplasticity, and used to penetrate solid vehicle armour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of projecting grenades with rifle-mounted launchers was first widely used during World War I {{and continues to}} the present, with the term [...] "rifle grenade" [...] now encompassing {{many different types of}} payloads including high explosive, fragmentation, and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> as well as concussion, smoke, incendiary, and flare missiles.|$|R
50|$|Tank {{ammunition}} {{was developed}} in WWI as tanks first appeared on the battlefield. However, as tank-on-tank warfare developed (including the development of anti-tank artillery), more specialized forms of ammunition were developed such as high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> and armor-piercing discarding sabot rounds. The development of shaped charges has {{had a significant impact}} on anti-tank ammunition design, now common on both tank-fire ammunition and in anti-tank missiles.|$|R
500|$|The AMX-30 is a main {{battle tank}} {{designed}} by Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX, then GIAT) and first {{delivered to the}} French Army in 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st Régiment de Chars de Combat (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30 weighed , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed {{that it would have}} required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105mm gun, firing a then advanced high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the [...] HS-110 diesel engine, although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank's performance.|$|E
2500|$|The Arjun {{features}} a 120mm main rifled gun with indigenously developed armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot ammunition, one PKT 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, and a NSVT 12.7mm machine gun. It {{is powered by}} a single MTU multi-fuel diesel engine rated at 1,400hp, and can achieve a maximum speed of [...] and a cross-country speed of [...] It has a four-man crew: commander, gunner, loader and driver. Automatic fire detection and suppression and NBC protection systems are included. All-round <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> protection by the newly developed Kanchan armour is claimed to be much higher than available in comparable third generation tanks.|$|E
50|$|A High-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> {{capable of}} {{penetrating}} 680 mm of Rolled homogeneous armour(RHA). Warhead uses a stand-off probe, {{which is located}} on the ogive of the projectile, to penetrate the armour.|$|E
50|$|RPGs {{with high}} {{explosive}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> (HEAT) are very effective against armored vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs). However, heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored (with thick armor) to be penetrated by an RPG, unless weaker {{sections of the}} armor or tank are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other un-armoured targets.|$|R
50|$|Medium {{tanks of}} World War II, {{evolved into the}} main battle tank (MBT) of the Cold War and took over the {{majority}} of tank roles on the battlefield. This gradual transition occurred in the 1950s and 1960s due to anti-tank guided missiles, sabot ammunition and high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads.</b> World War II had shown that {{the speed of a}} light tank was no substitute for armour & firepower and medium tanks were vulnerable to newer weapon technology, rendering them obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> {{during the second}} half of World War II led to lightweight infantry-carried anti-tank weapons such as the Panzerfaust, which could destroy some types of tanks. Tanks in the Cold War were designed with these weapons in mind, and led to greatly improved armour types during the 1960s, especially composite armour. Improved engines, transmissions and suspensions allowed tanks of this period to grow larger. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with advances in shell design and aiming technology.|$|R
50|$|The Panzerfaust 3's name {{dates back}} to the Panzerfaust used by the German army in World War II, which {{consisted}} of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead,</b> operated by a single soldier.|$|E
50|$|The RPG-29 uses a tandem-charge high {{explosive}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> to penetrate explosive reactive armor (ERA) {{as well as}} composite armor behind it. It is capable of penetrating MBTs, such as the M1 Abrams, older model Mark II version of the Merkava, Challenger 2 and T-90.|$|E
50|$|Production of the {{original}} missile ended in 1968, with a new version, the Cobra 2000 entering service. The Cobra 2000 extended {{the range of the}} missile to 2,000 meters and could be fitted with either an <b>Anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> or a dual purpose anti-tank/fragmentation warhead.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads.</b> Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|R

50|$|The Hohl-Sprung Mine 4672 or Hohlladungs-Spring-Mine 4672 (HL.Sp.Mi. 4672) ("hollow-charge jump mine") was a German {{anti-tank}} mine, {{together with}} the Panzer stab 43. Developed during the Second World War {{it was the first}} landmine to combine a shaped charge <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> with a tilt rod fuze.|$|E
50|$|The Panzerschreck was {{designed}} as a lightweight infantry anti-tank weapon. The weapon was shoulder-launched and fired a fin-stabilized rocket with a shaped-charge warhead. It was made in smaller numbers than the Panzerfaust, which was a disposable recoilless gun firing an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead.</b> It was an enlarged copy of the American bazooka.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{construction}} {{details of the}} armour remain a secret, it {{has been described as}} being made by sandwiching composite panels between rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). The number of layers may vary based on the user requirements. This armour is able to defeat armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) and high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> (HEAT) rounds and is known to defeat armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS).|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, it was {{reported}} that Iran had begun producing an improved version of the Russian AT-3B [...] The new missile was called the Improved Raad or I-Raad with improvements that include a new front airframe fitted with a tandem high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>warhead.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mokopa uses a {{powerful}} tandem shaped-charge, high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>warhead,</b> capable of penetrating over 1,350 mm (almost 4½ ft) of Rolled homogeneous armour (RHA), and also effective against Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA). This means the Mokopa {{is able to}} counter any current vehicle armour threats.|$|R
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{carries a}} tandem warhead. The precursor high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>warhead</b> penetrates armour or other obstacles (reinforced concrete, masonry, etc.). The main warhead creates a fine explosive cloud and takes {{into the interior}} through the hole, pierced by the precursor charge. Detonation of the main warhead explosive boasts a multiple effects (high-explosive and incendiary).|$|R
50|$|The PF-89 {{is the new}} {{generation}} standard light anti-tank weapon (LAW) in service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to replace the obsolete Type 69 RPG. It is a rocket launcher used primarily by infantry squads to engage and defeat light armor and bunkers. The recoilless design permits accurate delivery of an 80mm High Explosive <b>Anti-Tank</b> <b>warhead,</b> with negligible recoil. PF-89 entered mass production in 1993.|$|E
50|$|In May 2008 it was {{reported}} that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by insurgent fire of an RPG-29, which uses a tandem-charge high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> to penetrate explosive reactive armor (ERA) as well as composite armor behind it, in Iraq. The U.S. considered the RPG-29 threat to American armor high and refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi Army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the insurgents' hands.|$|E
50|$|Malkara {{was unusual}} amongst {{anti-tank}} missiles {{in that it}} had a High-explosive squash head (HESH), also known as High Explosive Plastic (HEP), warhead instead of the more usual shaped charge HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) warhead. The United Kingdom always showed interest for HESH, the main explosive-based anti-tank ammunition in British use including tanks like the Centurion. A 26/27 kg <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> was well above the average, but Malkara had a calibre of 203 mm.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} WWII, all {{forces had}} widely {{introduced}} unguided rockets using High-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> as their major anti-tank weapon (see Panzerfaust, Bazooka). However, these had a limited useful range of 100 m or so, and the Germans were looking to extend this {{with the use of}} a missile using wire guidance, the X-7. After the war, this became a major design class in the later 1950s and, by the 1960s, had developed into practically the only non-tank anti-tank system in general use. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the 9M14 Malyutka (aka [...] "Sagger") man-portable anti-tank missile proved potent against Israeli tanks. While other guidance systems have been tried, the basic reliability of wire guidance means this will remain the primary means of controlling anti-tank missiles in the near future. Anti-tank missiles may be launched from aircraft, vehicles or by ground troops in the case of smaller weapons.|$|R
25|$|A bazooka is a shoulder-fired, man-portable {{recoilless}} rocket {{anti-tank weapon}} {{that features a}} solid rocket motor for propulsion, allowing for high explosive (HE) and high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>warheads</b> to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The bazooka was co-invented in February 1942 by Edward Uhl, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, and Colonel Leslie Skinner.|$|R
5000|$|Purpose-designed {{anti-tank}} grenades generally use the shaped charge {{principle to}} penetrate tank armor, although the squash head concept is also used. In military terminology, warheads employing shape charges are called High Explosive <b>Anti-Tank</b> (HEAT) <b>warheads.</b> Because {{of the way}} shaped charges function, the grenade must hit the vehicle at an exact right angle for the effect to work most efficiently. The grenade facilitates this by deploying a small drogue parachute or fabric streamers after being thrown.|$|R
50|$|The M47 Dragon uses a wire-guidance {{system in}} concert with a high {{explosive}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> and was capable of defeating armored vehicles, fortified bunkers, main battle tanks, and other hardened targets. While it was primarily created to defeat the Soviet Union's T-55, T-62, and T-72 tanks, it saw use well into the 1990s, seeing action in the Persian Gulf War. The U.S. military officially retired the weapon in 2001, although stocks of the weapon remain in U.S. arsenals.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} two types of rockets {{produced}} was a High-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> (HEAT) round known as ’Buzogány’ (mace). With 4.2 kg of explosive, this shaped charge was capable of penetrating 300 mm of armour or concrete and destroy any type of heavy tank from a maximum distance of 1200 m. A high explosive (HE) projectile round was also available for use in an anti-personnel role referred to as ’Zápor’ (rainfall, shower). Both types were spin-stabilized.|$|E
50|$|For {{the base}} model M1 Abrams, Steven J. Zaloga gives a frontal armor {{estimate}} of 350 mm vs armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) and 700 mm vs high-explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warhead</b> (HEAT) in M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank 1982-1992 (1993). In M1 Abrams vs T-72 Ural (2009), he uses Soviet estimates of 470 mm vs APFSDS and 650 mm vs HEAT for the base model Abrams. He also gives the Soviet {{estimates for the}} M1A1, 600 mm vs APFSDS, and 700 mm vs HEAT.|$|E
50|$|The common term in {{military}} terminology for shaped charge warheads is high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT). HEAT <b>warheads</b> are frequently used in anti-tank guided missiles, unguided rockets, gun-fired projectiles (both spun and unspun), rifle grenades, land mines, bomblets, torpedoes, {{and various other}} weapons.|$|R
50|$|A top attack {{device is}} {{designed}} to attack armoured vehicles from above {{as a form of}} plunging fire, as the armour is usually thinnest at the top. Ideally, it will penetrate perpendicular to the attacked surface. The device may be delivered (often as a submunition) by a missile, artillery shell, or even an emplaced munition. Top attack munitions use either a high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>warhead</b> for direct impact or near impact, or an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead for over-flight of the target.|$|R
500|$|The first {{production}} {{versions of}} the AMX-30, named AMX 30B to distinguish them from the AMX 30A prototypes, were completed in June 1966, manufactured with a welded and cast hull and a fully cast turret. The production version of the tank had a combat weight of [...] The AMX-30's survivability was based on its mobility; French engineers believed that the tank's mobility would have been compromised had they added enough steel plating to protect against modern anti-tank threats, including high explosive <b>anti-tank</b> <b>warheads</b> (HEAT). As a result, the type had the thinnest armour of any main battle tank produced at the time. The turret has a maximum armour thickness of , the armour sloped at 70 degrees on the front plate and 23 degrees on the side, offering protection against [...] armour piercing projectiles. The Line-of-Sight armour values are: [...] for {{the front of the}} hull; [...] for the forward sides of the hull; [...] for the rear sides and rear of the hull; [...] for the hull top and bottom; [...] for the turret front; [...] for the turret sides; [...] for the turret rear and [...] for the turret top. Further protection is offered by a nuclear, biological and chemical protection suit, including a ventilation system.|$|R
