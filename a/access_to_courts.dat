Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which guarantees the “right to a hearing” in paragraph 1, does not explicitly lay down the right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> court; however, the European Court derived this right deeming that the right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> is a precondition {{for all the other}} guarantees provided in Article 6 (1) of the Convention. The paper analyses the legal views and case-law of the European <b>Court</b> with respect <b>to</b> preconditions for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court.</b> After first determining the scope of this right, the paper continues by examining the procedural preconditions for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court,</b> such as admissibility to bring an action, admissibility of recourse to legal remedies and the role of courts in the domestic legal order of contracting states.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} rights in any democratic state is the right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court.</b> Every individual shall have the right to bring legal disputes before a court, in a proceeding with specifically defined characteristics, a fair trial, and the state is responsible for supplying the conditions and prerequisites to carry out this dispute resolution process in a court of law. However, this right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> does not specify whether the parties also have the right to waive, voluntarily and with binding effect, the right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> and a fair trial. This is the question explored in this doctoral thesis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine and analyse the extent to which it is possible under Swedish law for private parties to agree, with binding effect, <b>to</b> waive <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court,</b> either partially or fully. This investigation analyses situations in which contracts can be used to abstain from procedural rights. One aspect covered in this thesis is the waiving of the right <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> in its entirety, and another is the waiving of some parts of this access. The investigation examines whether a previously concluded agreement is binding when it is referred <b>to</b> before a <b>court,</b> and the procedural legal effects that the contract produces between the parties and in relation <b>to</b> the <b>court...</b>|$|R

40|$|Widespread {{electronic}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> case files {{gives rise}} to security concerns previously unrealized {{in the era of}} paper records. As the United States Department of Justice noted, the emergence of a 2 ̆ 2 cottage industry 2 ̆ 2 of websites that republish court filings online for the purposes of witness intimidation, retaliation, and harassment poses 2 ̆ 2 a grave risk of harm 2 ̆ 2 to cooperating witnesses and defendants. Accordingly, the benefits associated with remote electronic availability and dissemination of judicial documents may come at a considerable cost. This Note describes the options that district courts within the Second Circuit could implement to mitigate these concerns. Part I of this Note outlines how electronic <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> filings has altered the traditional balance between disclosure and privacy, and addresses the concerns associated with providing electronic <b>access</b> <b>to</b> plea agreements. Part I also outlines the qualified rights of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> judicial documents under the common law and the First Amendment.

These machines are becoming an integrated network integral to the workings of the court. With the assistance of the machines, the myriad and diverse members of the justice and public safety communities together with the public will evolve into a single complex whole that could dedicate itself to creating a more humane and just society comprised of better informed individuals to whom they are genuinely accountable. There are those who fear the machines, afraid that personal privacy is doomed with public <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> records. Professor Silverman explains how this fear is unwarranted. In the first part of the article he introduces the reader to this technology (Part II) and its likely role in evolving justice information systems (Parts I and III). In the second half of the article, Professor Silverman explores the debate over whether the public should be permitted <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> records over the Internet. After explaining the origins, history, and principal sides of this debate (Part IV), he argues, first, that when used properly, XML permits the public <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> records over the Internet while promoting public safety and protecting personal security (Part V) and, second, that the presence of discrediting and embarrassing facts in a case file does not justify limiting public <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> records over the Internet while permitting unlimited public access at the courthouse (Part VI) ...|$|R
