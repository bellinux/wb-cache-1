A reservoir known as the Huntsville Reservoir is located in the watershed of Toby Creek. It has a capacity of approximately 1.915 billion gallons.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico and Thailand, {{the heads}} and legs <b>are</b> <b>removed,</b> and the {{remainder}} may be boiled, sauted, grilled, dried or diced.|$|E
5|$|TiCl4 is {{produced}} by the chloride process, which involves the reduction of titanium oxide ores, typically ilmenite (FeTiO3) with carbon under flowing chlorine at 900°C. Impurities <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> by distillation.|$|E

50|$|Three other ramps <b>were</b> <b>removed</b> {{as part of}} safety, structural, and {{redevelopment}} efforts. On {{the north}} side, The South Main Street ramp leading to Lehigh Street and the industrial area along the Monocacy Creek <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> in 1965.

50|$|As of 8 a.m. May 19, {{thirteen}} {{cars had}} <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> {{and the remaining}} three were expected to <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by the early afternoon. By 4 p.m., all the cars <b>were</b> <b>removed,</b> and <b>were</b> moved to the Metro-North rail yard in Bridgeport.|$|R
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|Aston Martin Racing {{adapted the}} DB9 for sports car racing, {{producing}} the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3. These two cars are lightened DB9s; the interior features <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> and the aluminium body panels {{are replaced by}} carbon fibre panels. Additionally, the engine has been tweaked in both the cars to produce more horsepower.|$|E
5|$|Clearing waste: CSF {{allows for}} the removal of waste {{products}} from the brain, and is critical in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into the CSF and <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.|$|E
50|$|Starting from an octahedron, a vertex of high {{connectivity}} <b>is</b> <b>removed,</b> {{and then}} a non-adjacent vertex <b>is</b> <b>removed.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} of Kentucky's toll roads, the tolls <b>were</b> <b>removed</b> as the {{construction}} bonds were paid off. Tolls <b>were</b> <b>removed</b> from the four-lane section in 1985, and the road became a freeway in 1986 when the remaining tolls <b>were</b> <b>removed</b> from the two-lane section.|$|R
25|$|The 5' {{sequence}} <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> by RNase P, {{whereas the}} 3' end <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> by the tRNase Z enzyme.|$|R
5|$|Collected from coastal waters, zircon-bearing sand is {{purified}} by spiral concentrators {{to remove}} lighter materials, {{which are then}} returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile <b>are</b> <b>removed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} {{the boiling}} frog {{story has been}} used as a way of explaining the sorites paradox. It describes a hypothetical heap of sand from which individual grains <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> one at a time, and asks if there is a specific point when it can no longer be defined as a heap.|$|E
5|$|In the second, mild {{protection}} scheme, A and dA {{are protected}} with isobutyryl or phenoxyacetyl groups (PAC). C and dC bear acetyl protection, and G and dG are protected with 4-isopropylphenoxyacetyl (iPr-PAC) or dimethylformamidino (dmf) groups. Mild protecting groups <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> {{more readily than}} the standard protecting groups. However, the phosphoramidites bearing these groups are less stable when stored in solution.|$|E
50|$|Smaller cysts may <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by laser treatment, larger cysts {{will have}} to <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> surgically in an {{operating}} room.|$|R

50|$|YaST used {{to include}} SaX and SaX2, the Suse Advanced X configuration. SaX was re-written as SaX2 in SuSE Linux 6.4. SaX1 <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> in SuSE Linux 8.1 and SaX2 <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> from the YaST Control Center in openSUSE 11.2. SaX2 <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> {{completely}} in openSUSE 11.3.|$|R
5|$|Owners {{of forests}} planted after 31 December 1989 {{are able to}} opt into the scheme and receive units for forest sequestration. If these forests <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> from the land the owner must repay these units.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{transcript}} RNAs {{are often}} modified by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap {{are added to}} eukaryotic pre-mRNA and introns <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> by the spliceosome.|$|E
5|$|Some {{methods of}} {{fixation}} for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and Herbert screws or pins made {{of stainless steel}} or materials that can be absorbed by the body. If loose bodies are found, they <b>are</b> <b>removed.</b> Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.|$|E

5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be used as food. Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela– provided the highly irritant hairs, the spiders' main defense system, <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> first.|$|E
5|$|Subtype classifications– such as {{catatonic}} and {{paranoid schizophrenia}} – <b>are</b> <b>removed.</b> These were retained in previous revisions largely {{for reasons of}} tradition, but had subsequently proved to be of little worth.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} gases released during {{volcanic activity}} are water, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride. These sulfur and halogen gases and metals <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> {{from the atmosphere}} by processes of chemical reaction, dry and wet deposition, and by adsorption {{onto the surface of}} volcanic ash.|$|E
5|$|While Graham and Barrett (2004) had {{determined}} that subgenus Hermione was monophyletic, Santos-Gally et. al. (2011) did not. If two species excluded {{in the former}} study <b>are</b> <b>removed</b> from the analysis, the studies are in agreement, the species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus Narcissus. Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural ('ancient') hybrids (nothospecies).|$|E
5|$|While {{cockroaches}} do {{not have}} lungs as do vertebrates, and can continue to respire if their heads <b>are</b> <b>removed,</b> in some very large species, the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air {{in and out of}} the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.|$|E
50|$|In the BOS {{steelmaking}} process, sulfur is {{the first}} element to <b>be</b> <b>removed.</b> Sulfur <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> from the impure blast furnace iron {{by the addition of}} several hundred kilograms of magnesium powder by a lance. Magnesium sulfide is formed, which then floats on the molten iron and <b>is</b> <b>removed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the track}} in D.C. <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> and sold for scrap.

The Pennsylvania Avenue NW trackwork between the Capitol and the Treasury Building <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> during the street's mid-1980s redevelopment.|$|R
50|$|The {{promenade}} deck and rear chapel may have <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> {{from the house}} during Hugh Grant's occupation.
