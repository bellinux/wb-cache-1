5|$|The film {{collected}} 87.7 {{million in}} the United States in 19 days. By mid June 2014, the film collected 91.1 {{million in the}} United States, {{and by the end}} of its 25-day run <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> US$1.5 million mark, becoming one of the biggest commercially successful Telugu films in the country.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone {{was observed in}} the South China Sea on August15. It moved northwestward and struck the Leizhou Peninsula in southern China on August18. The storm turned to the west <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> northern Gulf of Tonkin, hitting northern Vietnam and dissipating on August20. Another storm was first detected northeast of Luzon on August21. A northwest trajectory brought the system through the Ryukyu Islands, and the storm ultimately dissipated over eastern China on August24, having moved ashore near Wenzhou.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled {{to use it to}} their advantage. Lauren's cross from the right was cleared away by the United defence and Henry moments later miscued his effort aimed at goal. Moments later Ljungberg beat his marker <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> ball into the penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, the German {{forces had}} {{advanced}} {{within a few}} kilometers of Kiev below the Pripyat Marshes. The 1st Panzer Group then went south while the 17th Army struck east and trapped three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Center, had crossed the Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.|$|E

5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic to Dakar, {{proceeding to}} Las Palmas and then Lisbon. There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a}} half years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined that she was not worth overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Alps into southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy to sell their products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Irene was a {{long-lived}} Cape Verde-type Atlantic hurricane {{during the}} 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed near Cape Verde on August 4 <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, turning northward around Bermuda before being absorbed by an extratropical while situated southeast of Newfoundland. Irene persisted for 14days as a tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the record-breaking season.|$|E

5|$|March-Phillipps {{was killed}} during Operation Aquatint in September 1942. On the same mission, Hayes evaded capture <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Spanish border, {{only to be}} handed over to the Germans who kept him in solitary {{confinement}} for nine months before he was executed by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Appleyard later joined the Special Air Service, and {{on the same day that}} Hayes was executed Appleyard was reported missing when his plane failed to return from a mission. Lassen would also join the Special Air Service; he was awarded two bars to his MC and promoted to major before receiving a posthumous Victoria Cross in Italy in 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 1940, 'G' and 'T' Patrols left Cairo <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> {{desert to}} {{northwest}} of Kufra. On arrival {{they met with}} representatives from the Free French forces in Chad, and on 11 January carried out a joint raid on the Italian fort at Murzuk. After two hours' fighting the fort remained in Italian hands, but the adjoining airfield had been destroyed. The units then withdrew southwards towards the Free French post at Zouar.|$|E
5|$|Sabina {{got to her}} feet, whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} to persuade her {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat's winning time of 1: {{and last}} quarter mile in 23 seconds were both {{records for the}} Derby. In addition, he had run each quarter-mile faster than before, with times of , 24, , , and 23 seconds. Sham {{maintained}} his stride <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line in second place, eight lengths ahead of third-place finisher Our Native, who had lost ground on the final turn into the homestretch. Sham also broke the previous course record {{with a time of}} 1:. Shecky Greene, who led for most of the race, finished in sixth position.|$|E
5|$|The Mullan Road was {{constructed}} in 1862 <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Snake River with a ferry crossing at Lyons Ferry until {{the construction of the}} Lower Monumental Dam downstream caused the water level to rise and longer wait times, resulting in the reconstruction of the Snake River Bridge. The current route of SR261 from Washtucna to Ritzville was designated during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 as SSH11E.|$|E
5|$|The Pechenegs {{destroyed}} the Hungarians' dwelling places. Those {{who survived the}} double attack left the Pontic steppes <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Carpathians {{in search of a}} new homeland. The memory of the destruction brought by the Pechenegs seems to have been preserved by the Hungarians. The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs (besenyő) corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle (bese). Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians most probably refers to the Pechenegs' attack.|$|E

5|$|The common raven {{evolved in}} the Old World <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which {{examined}} the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across {{the rest of the}} Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna, {{with the}} French in close pursuit. A Russian army under Gen. Mikhail Kutuzov also maneuvered {{away from the}} French, {{withdrawing}} to the east. At the Ill river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von Kienmayer. On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in Amstetten. On 7 November the Russians arrived in St. Pölten <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Danube river the next day. Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the Danube, holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein, near the village Krems, until the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{final month}} of the war offered little respite to the battalion. In {{the days leading up}} to the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> River Scheldt on 9 November. On the day of the Armistice, the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished.|$|E
