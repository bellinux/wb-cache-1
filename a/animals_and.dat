5|$|Wissenburg and Schlosberg's {{workshop}} {{formed the}} basis of Political <b>Animals</b> <b>and</b> Animal Politics, a collection edited by Wissenburg and Schlosberg, with earlier versions of many of the volume's chapters having being presented at that time. Originally, the editors had intended to have discussion of political theory, of movements for <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> of real-world politics, but the final volume was somewhat more theory-based than this. Political <b>Animals</b> <b>and</b> Animal Politics was published in 2014 by Palgrave Macmillan in hardback format; {{it is part of the}} Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series, which is edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. This interdisciplinary series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges posed by animal ethics.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} {{that there are many}} differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant microRNAs (miRNAs), and that numerical features based on sequence and structure can be used to predict the function of individual miRNAs. However, there is little research regarding numerical differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant miRNAs, and whether a single numerical feature or combination of features could be used to distinguish <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant miRNAs or not. Therefore, in current study we aimed to discover numerical features {{that could be used to}} accomplish this. We performed a large-scale analysis of 132 miRNA numerical features, and identified 17 highly significant distinguishing features. However, none of the features independently could clearly differentiate <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant miRNAs. By further analysis, we found a four-feature subset that included helix number, stack number, length of pre-miRNA, and minimum free energy, and developed a logistic classifier that could distinguish <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant miRNAs effectively. The precision of the classifier was greater than 80 %. Using this tool, we confirmed that there were universal differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant miRNAs, and that a single feature was unable to adequately distinguish the difference. This feature set and classifier represent a valuable tool for identifying differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> plant miRNAs at a molecular level...|$|R
