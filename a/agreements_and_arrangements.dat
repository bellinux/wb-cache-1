50|$|Social {{control theory}} proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs {{encourage}} {{them not to}} break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into and {{have a stake in}} their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals. It does not consider motivational issues, simply stating that human beings may choose to engage {{in a wide range of}} activities, unless the range is limited by the processes of socialization and social learning. The theory derives from a Hobbesian view of human nature as represented in Leviathan, i.e. that all choices are constrained by implicit social contracts, <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangements</b> among people. Thus, morality is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal.|$|E

The system of [...] "One country, two systems" [...] would be established, exempting Macau from the Socialist system and several laws decreed by the central government in Beijing. The capitalist, legal system and liberal society enjoyed by Macau would remain unchanged for a minimum of 50 years after the transfer.

50|$|Social {{control theory}} (later also called social bonding theory) proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs {{encourage}} {{them not to}} break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into, and {{have a stake in}} their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals.

Thus, morality is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal. Although Travis Hirschi was not the first to propose a social control theory, the Causes of Delinquency (1969) was a landmark book, contrasting with the Strain Theory (see anomie and the work of Robert King Merton) and Conflict Theory. In particular, Hirschi challenged Differential Association Theory (Edwin Sutherland and Donald Cressey) on the impact of delinquent peers on delinquency. He proposed that delinquent peers would be found to have no direct effect on delinquency when social bonds inhibiting delinquency were taken onto account. He argued that similarly unattached youth drifted together into delinquent groups. It was weak social bonds that resulted in both delinquency and association with delinquents.|$|E

This paper comes from a study funded by São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) which had as its main objective to map and analyze the topic themes related to agreements and financing of early childhood education from national scientific journals of education, evaluated by Federal Agency of Support and Evaluation of Postgraduate Education (CAPES) as A 1 (2008 as base year), during the period 2000 to 2010, identifying which journals have more relevance to the topic studied. This study was developed through a qualitative research, using bibliographic survey and analysis as methodological procedure, and is linked to an interinstitutional group of study and research about educational policy called Grupo de Estudos e Pesquisas em Política Educacional (GREPPE) - Rio Claro Section. Based on data analysis, we present a perspective that is more focused on funding, leading with some dead ends which is still facing child education...|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{effective}} role of local institutions in controlling free-range livestock grazing, illicit tree felling, and sharing benefits, the <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangements</b> are informal and not legally binding (Heinen and Mehta 1999; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015). So, clarification {{and enforcement of}} the rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders are essential. For example, a good policy of environment protection and legal framework facilitates enforcement mechanisms with gradual sanctions. Thus, legal recognition of local institutions and endorsement of their bylaws are essential elements to encourage investment in forest resource management (Heinen and Mehta 1999; Bekele 2003; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015). For example, a clear definition of rights, returns and responsibilities, and adequate incentives are important for the sustainability of people-centred management of natural resources (Kajembe et al. 2005). A case study in Tanzania showed that the government alone {{was not able to}} protect and manage the forest resources sustainably (Blomley 2006). Hence, establishing legal institutions and governance that enhance community involvement in forest management, together with clarification of ownership and user rights, is seen as one of the optimal solutions (FAO 2000; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015) to promote forest development and sustainable utilization in Tehulederi District and elsewhere in Ethiopia.|$|E

In addition, it is necessary to consider how to design international agreements can be designed effectively. The management system of forest and implementation of laws and policies varies by each country. In most countries, the legal or constitutional responsibility for management of public forest lands rests with regional governments. In some countries, the central governmen...|$|E
40|$|This report studies how the {{initiatives}} maintain their values over time, {{as well as}} an openness to debates over these values, thanks to the way they set up and then maybe adjust over time their governance modes (both in terms of internal organization and of alliances/partnerships with other actors) and their coordination modes (contracts, <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangements).</b> It focuses on how within the food chain and between its different partners (producers, buyers, retailers, and possibly also consumers) values are discussed, negotiated, and translated into concrete management, coordination and governance modes, which allow {{the initiatives}} to reach a certain degree of stakeholders and network alignment. Our hypothesis is that specific modes of management, coordination and governance allow to maintain the ‘added value’ of organic market initiatives, and that the stakeholders despite their possible different or diverging visions would collectively elaborate and adjust these modes of management, coordination and governance over time, alongside with the upscaling or growth process of their initiative. This approach is mainly anchored in the perspectives of the sociology of organizations and markets and its focus on coordination modes (Dubuisson-Quellier, 2003; Dubuisson-Quellier, Lamine and Le Velly, 2011), and of the sociology of controversies (Chateauraynaud, 2011) and its attention to the reconfiguration of arguments and visions over time within a collective of social actors in interaction with the (external) social world...|$|E

In so doing, this study will focus on the Kingdom's various efforts and attempts in finding a just and lasting peaceful solution on the Arab-Israeli conflict in general, and to the Palestinian problem in specific. This problem has been a major source of instability and insecurity in the Middle East for more than half a century. However, there seems to be a consensus among scholars and international observers that the middle East peace process has taken a critical path during the last few years. The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a few <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangements</b> between the Palestinians and Israelis. These agreement were designed to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict and to bring a comprehensive and just Peace to the area. The purpose of this study is threefold.

Secondly, a major part of the paper is devoted to analyze the role and contribution of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the maintenance of peace and security in the Middle East; which took the form of the fahd peace plan and Arab peace initiative.
