40|$|Background: In {{earlier studies}} uninostril yoga {{breathing}} {{was shown to}} influence {{the activity of the}} cerebral hemispheres differently, based on (i) auditory evoked potentials recorded from bilateral scalp sites, and (ii) performance in hemisphere-specific tasks. But change in P 300 (event-related potential generated when subjects attend to and discriminate between stimuli) from bilateral scalp sites when subjects were practicing uni- and alternate-nostril breathing are yet to be explored. Aim: The present study was designed {{to determine whether or not}} immediately after uninostril or <b>alternate</b> <b>nostril</b> yoga <b>breathing</b> there would be a change in the ability to pay attention to a given stimulus. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine healthy male volunteers, with ages between 20 and 45 years were randomly allocated to five sessions, viz., (i) right-, (ii) left-, (iii) alternate-nostril yoga breathing, (iv) breath awareness and (v) no intervention, each for 45 min on separate days. The P 300 event related potential was recorded using an auditory oddball paradigm from sites on the left (C 3) and right (C 4), referenced to linked earlobes, before and after each session.

Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the effect of a modified form of isolated <b>alternate</b> <b>nostril,</b> slow <b>breathing</b> exercise on perceived stress, and cardiovascular parameters in young, male volunteers. Settings and Design: This was a randomized control study carried out at Advanced Centre for Yoga Therapy Education and Research, Department of Physiology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry in 2014. Subjects and Methods: Hundred healthy male volunteers were randomized into control group, n = 50 and slow breathing group (study), n = 50. Slow breathing exercise training was given to study group for 30 min a day, 5 times/week for 12 weeks, under the supervision of certified yoga trainers. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) using Cohen's questionnaire, anthropometric parameters such as body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded at baseline and after 12 weeks. The control group did not receive any intervention. Slow breathing exercise training was provided for the study group. During the study period, one volunteer opted out of the study group due to personal reasons. Results: HR, SBP, DBP, and PSS decreased significantly (P 0. 05) was observed in BMI and WHR. There was no significant change in the control group. Conclusion: Twelve weeks of modified slow breathing exercise reduced perceived stress and improved the cardiovascular parameters.

40|$|Background: Breathing is {{necessary}} for all human life, {{in order to give}} oxygen to muscles and to release energy by oxidation of nutrients. Breathing becomes even more important during physical activities, and especially during high intensity training. One training method that has grown in popularity during the 21 st century is Crossfit. This training method puts high demands on the muscles, and a good ability to provide oxygen to the muscles {{is necessary}} for a good performance. Throughout the years, studies have been made to investigate how different breathing methods could affect the performance during physical activity. Though, there are not any studies that focus on breathing methods impact on performance during high intensity physical activity. Purpose: The purpose was to investigate if the performance, measured in time, number of repetitions, and perceived exertion was affected by conscious controlled <b>nostril</b> <b>breathing</b> during high intensity power training, as well as, compared to self-chosen breathing, for individuals training Crossfit. Method: This study was an experimental crossover study. The study was carried out in order to see which impact <b>nostril</b> <b>breathing</b> have on the performance, compared to self-chosen breathing. Participants were randomized selected into two groups, where each group did a test with <b>nostril</b> <b>breathing</b> and one test with self-chose breathing. Each participant did a max-test during one minute in each movement: double unders, push ups, box jumps, burpees and air squat, as well as a WOD of 500 m row, 30 kettlebellswing and 20 pullups. Each participant also stated his or her perceived exertion after each test, using the Borgscale. Results: There were {{a significant difference between the}} interventions for performance measured in number of repetitions for the movements’ box jump and burpees, where <b>nostril</b> <b>breathing</b> had a significant negative impact on the performance compared to self-chose breathing. The performance for the rest of the movements, double unders, push ups, air squat, WOD and perceived exertion was not significant effected by the two breathing methods in this study. Conclusion: There was a significant impairment for the movements’ box jumps and burpees. There were no significant differences in air squat, push ups, double unders, WOD or perceived exertion. The future recommendation is to avoid <b>nostril</b> <b>breathing</b> during similar movements that involves multiple muscles and requires significant agility movements. ...|$|R

40|$|Patanjali, {{foremost}} exponent of Yoga, described pranayama as {{the gradual}} unforced cessation of breathing. Pranayama {{is derived from}} two Sanskrit words-prana (life) or yama (control). Pranayam or control of prana or life force yields heart beat pulse and mind control. Yoga combines scientific technique of right behavior (Yama-Niyama), proper posture (asana), life force control (pranayama), interiorisation of the mind (pratyahara), concentration (dhyan), developing intuition (dharna) and Samadhi (ultimate realization). Suryanadisuddhi pranayama starts with closing the right nostril with the thumb of the left hand followed by exhalation through right nostril and inhaling slowly through the same nostril. This forms one round of suryanadisuddi pranayama. Pulse rate was recorded before and after twelve cycles of left nostril breathing. Thirty two readings were taken.

40|$|Background: Long-term <b>alternate</b> <b>nostril</b> <b>breathing</b> (ANB) {{has been}} shown to enhance {{autonomic}} control of the heart by increasing parasympathetic modulation. However, there is no information on the immediate effects of ANB on autonomic control compared to paced breathing (PB) at the same rate in individuals who are inexperienced with yogic breathing. Aim: To examine cardiac autonomic modulation following ANB in comparison to that following PB in individuals who were inexperienced in ANB. Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy individuals (22. 3 ± 2. 9 years) with no prior experience with ANB engaged in 30 min of both ANB and PB which were preceded and followed by 5 min of normal breathing (PRE, post-ANB, and post-PB, respectively). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during all conditions. HRV was reported as spectral power in the total (lnTP), low-(lnLF), and high-frequency (lnHF) ranges and were natural log (ln) transformed. Results: Analysis of covariance revealed lnTP, lnLF and lnHF were greater during both post-ANB and post-PB compared to PRE (P< 0. 05). MAP and lnLF/lnHF did not significantly differ between conditions. Conclusions: These data suggest that there was an immediate increase in cardiac autonomic modulation following ANB and PB without a shift in autonomic balance in individuals inexperienced with yogic breathing.

Keeping this in mind the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that 10 min. of right nostril breathing have any immediate effect on ventilatory volumes and capacities in healthy volunteers. Methodology: Forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), Forced expiratory volume percent (FEV 1 /FVC%), Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), Forced expiratory flow 25 - 75 % (FEF 25 - 75 %), Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), Slow vital capacity (SVC), Expiratory reserve volume (ERV), Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) and Tidal volume (TV) were recorded before and after Surya Nadi Pranayama. Results & Conclusion: There was a significant increase in FVC (p< 0. 0001), FEV 1 (p< 0. 0007), PEFR (p< 0. 0001), FEF 25 - 75 % (p< 0. 0001), MVV (p< 0. 0001), SVC (p< 0. 0001), ERV (0. 0006), IRV (p< 0. 0001) and TV (0. 0055) after suryanadi pranayama.

This study aims to determine differential effects of these techniques on reaction time (RT), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP). Materials and Methods: Twenty yoga-trained subjects came to the lab on six different days and RT, HR, and BP were recorded randomly before and after nine rounds of right UNB (surya nadi [SN]), left UNB (chandra nadi [CN]), right initiated ANB (surya bhedana [SB]), left initiated ANB (chandra bhedana [CB]), nadi shuddhi (NS), and normal breathing (NB). Results: Overall comparison of ∆ % changes showed {{statistically significant differences between}} groups for all parameters. There was an overall reduction in HR- and BP-based parameters following CB, CN, and NS with concurrent increases following SB and SN. The differential effects of right nostril initiated (SB and SN) and left nostril initiated (CB, CN, and NS) UNB and ANB techniques were clearly evidenced. Changes following NB were insignificant in all respects. The overall comparison of ∆ % changes for RT showed statistically significant differences between groups that were significantly lowered following both SB and SN. Discussion and Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of sympathomimetic effects of right nostril initiated pranayamas with sympatholytic/parasympathomimetic effect following left nostril initiated pranayamas. We suggest that the main effect of UNB and ANB techniques is determined by the nostril used for inspiration rather than that used for expiration. We conclude that right and left yogic UNB and ANB techniques have differential physiological effects that are in tune with the traditional swara yoga concept that air flow through right nostril (SN and pingala swara) is activatory in nature, whereas the flow through left nostril (CN and ida swara) is relaxatory...|$|E

The effect of different concentrations of CMC on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was studied using a human nasal epithelial suspension cell culture system. The CBF was determined by computerized microscope photometry. The in vivo rabbit nasal mucosal tolerance of the mucoadhesive polymer was investigated using light microscopy. Twice daily, six rabbits received CMC powder in one nostril and CMC/apomorphine powder in the <b>alternate</b> <b>nostril</b> for 4 weeks. Two control rabbits received air puffs in one nostril and nothing in the <b>alternate</b> <b>nostril.</b> The rabbits were subsequently sacrificed and the stained nasal sections examined microscopically. CMC showed both concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory effects on the CBF. Only mild-to-moderate cilio-inhibition was recorded with the different concentrations of the polymer. CMC (both with and without apomorphine) caused mild-to-moderate inflammation after 4 weeks. Necrosis, squamous metaplasia or ciliary degeneration was not observed. Based on: (1) the mild-to-moderate cilio-inhibition induced by different concentrations of CMC; and (2) the mild-to-moderate nasal mucosal inflammation caused by CMC with and without apomorphine, we conclude that this polymer can be considered as a safe carrier for short-term intranasal administration.
