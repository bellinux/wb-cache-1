25|$|The school {{building}} was financed by Ripley {{and run by}} the non-denominational British and Foreign School Society It was designed by Andrews Son <b>and</b> <b>Pepper</b> <b>in</b> a gothic revivalist style. The halls and classrooms were on a single level with service rooms in a basement. Internally the ground floor (total area 4,192 sq. ft.) was mainly taken up by two large halls of double height. The south hall of 1600 sq. ft. accommodated the girls primary school and the northern hall of 1300 sq. ft. accommodated the boys. Two smaller classrooms accommodated the infants. Later photographic {{evidence suggests that the}} class room block as built varied from the plan. Instead of two unequally sized classrooms with an entrance lobby to the north there were two equally sized rooms separated by a centrally placed entrance lobby. The entrance door was beneath a gabled semi-dormer with a round window in the gable – very similar to the gables of the north façade.|$|E

2500|$|Typical yaoi dōjinshi {{features}} male-male pairings from non-romantic manga and anime. Much of {{the material}} derives from male-oriented shōnen and seinen works which contain close male-male friendships and are perceived by fans to imply elements of homoeroticism, such as with Captain Tsubasa and Saint Seiya, two titles which popularized yaoi in the 1980s. Weekly Shonen Jump {{is known to have}} a large female readership who engage in yaoi readings. Publishers of shōnen manga may create [...] "homoerotic-themed" [...] merchandise as fan service to their BL fans. Comiket's co-founder Yoshihiro Yonezawa described dōjinshi as akin to [...] "girls playing with dolls"; yaoi fans may ship any male-male pairing, sometimes pairing off a favourite character, or creating a story about two original male characters and incorporating established characters into the story. Any male character may become the subject of a yaoi dōjinshi, including characters from non-manga titles such as Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings, video games such as Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy, or real people such as politicians. Amateur authors may also create characters out of personifications of abstract concepts (such as the personification of countries in [...] ) or complementary objects like salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper.</b> <b>In</b> Japan, the labelling of dōjinshi yaoi manga is typically composed of the two lead characters' names, separated by a multiplication sign, with the seme being first and the uke being second.|$|E

From time to time Wetzel had brought these things. A pile of wood and a bundle of pine cones lay in one corner. Haunches of dried beef, bear and buffalo meat hung from pegs; a bag of parched corn, another of dried apples lay on a rocky shelf.
