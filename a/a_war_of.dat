5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand the pounding of cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. These could be protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough men to storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was not <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> assembled armies facing each other on a field, but <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> artillery sieges. It required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1872. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser were ordered shortly {{after the end of}} the Franco-Prussian War, under the assumption that the French would quickly attempt <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> revenge. The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. Deutschland cost the German government 8,240,000gold marks. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign shipbuilder.|$|E
5|$|German East Africa, {{acquired}} by Germany during the 1880s, covered roughly , and by 1914 {{was home to}} about 5,000 white settlers, {{most of whom were}} of German origin. German East African soldiery at the outbreak of war comprised 216 German officers and enlisted men, and 2,450 askaris (native soldiers); police numbered 45 whites and 2,154 askaris. Because of the British Royal Navy's domination of the Indian Ocean, German East Africa was largely isolated from outside help. It therefore fought <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> improvisation, judicious resource management and unorthodox strategy. During the conflict, its military strength grew to a peak of 3,300 whites and anywhere between 15,000 and 30,000 askaris, all commanded by Generalmajor Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.|$|E

5|$|Kaiser {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1871.

The ship was launched on 19 March 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 13 February 1875. Kaiser cost the German government 8,226,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III {{had tried}} to secure {{territorial}} concessions from both sides {{before and after the}} Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended up with nothing. He then hoped that Austria would join in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join in the cause. This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own. The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I's strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight, whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably Spicheren, Wörth, Mars la Tour, and Gravelotte, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} Germanicus reached Pannonia, Severus was {{attacked}} in Moesia, but successfully repelled the rebels. By the time Germanicus arrived the rebels had withdrawn to mountain fortresses {{from which they}} launched raids. The Romans were tactically unsuited at countering raids, so Tiberius had to utilize his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments to cover more ground. Tiberius {{appears to have been}} conducting <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> attrition against the rebels who were now occupying strong defensive positions. In addition, the Romans began working to drive the rebels out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any tribes that would lay down their arms, and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have been hoping to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December three {{prisoners in}} Armagh Women's Prison joined the strike, {{including}} Mairéad Farrell, {{followed by a}} short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing {{in and out of}} a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the rebels}} had been subdued, Abu Bakr began <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> conquest, {{beginning}} with Iraq. Sending his most brilliant general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, Iraq was conquered {{in a series}} of successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians. Abu Bakr's confidence grew, and once Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq, Abu Bakr issued a call to arms for the invasion of Syria in February 634. The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series of carefully planned and well coordinated military operations that employed strategy instead of pure strength to deal with Byzantine defensive measures. The Muslim armies, however soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response, and their commanders called for reinforcements. Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion. In July 634, the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn. Damascus fell in September 634, followed by the Battle of Fahl where the last significant garrison of Palestine was defeated and routed.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, German forces {{achieved}} major {{victories and}} occupied {{some of the}} most important economic areas of the Soviet Union, mainly in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these Axis successes, the German offensive stalled in the Battle of Moscow and subsequently the Soviet winter counteroffensive pushed German troops back. The Red Army absorbed the Wehrmacht's strongest blows and forced the unprepared Germans into <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> attrition. The Wehrmacht would never again mount a simultaneous offensive along the entire strategic Soviet–Axis front. The failure of the operation drove Hitler to demand further operations of increasingly limited scope inside the Soviet Union, such as Case Blue in 1942 and Operation Citadel in 1943 — all of which eventually failed.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the pilot}} took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near <b>a</b> <b>War</b> <b>of</b> the Worlds filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production {{found it difficult to}} get them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a sound stage because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots on the set of The O.C. two months after principal photography.|$|E

The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent {{figures such as}} Göring, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law. Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, {{who was convicted of}} crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946. The former commandant at Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others, was tried and executed in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Australians had {{continued}} to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly impatient with the Australian approach, in early 1967 the Commander US MACV, General William Westmoreland, had complained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach. However, the Australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from {{the population in the}} villages while working towards slowly extending government control, and such urgings went largely unheeded.|$|E
5|$|The court deliberated {{for nearly}} two months before passing {{judgement}} on 30 September, with the defendants being individually sentenced on 1 October. Hess was found guilty on two counts: crimes against peace (planning and preparing <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>of</b> aggression), and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes.

These seven were transported by aircraft to the Allied military prison at Spandau in Berlin on 18 July 1947. The Soviet member of the tribunal, Major-General Iona Nikitchenko, filed a document recording his dissent of Hess's sentence; he felt the death sentence was warranted.|$|E
