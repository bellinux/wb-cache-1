40|$|Flower-like anatase TiO 2 {{hierarchical}} spheres {{assembled by}} nanosheets were synthesized by glycine assistant via a simple hydrothermal approach and <b>after-annealing</b> process. These flower-like spheres are about 2 μm in diameter with sheet thickness about 20 nm. Results showed reaction time, temperature, solution pH and glycine dosage all {{played an important}} role in control of shape and size of the as-synthesized TiO 2 nanocrystals. The photocatalytic activity of this nano-TiO 2 was evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation decomposition of methyl orange under sunlight illumination in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). The photocatalytic activity of the obtained TiO 2 was higher than that of commercial TiO 2. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} <b>after-annealed</b> {{temperature}} on the microstructure, optical and electrical properties of solution processed amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin films were investigated in this article. The X-ray diffraction results confirmed {{that all the}} films were an amorphous structure. A transmittance of more than 90 % in the visible wavelength region was obtained. the a-IGZO thin films reached the lowest electrical resistivity of 9. 44 × 10 4 Ω·cm with the <b>after-annealed</b> temperature of 300 ℃...|$|R
