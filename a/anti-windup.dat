40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} design and {{implementation}} of anti windup compensators for UAVs with magnitude and rate saturated actuators. The focus is on two types of UAVs; a Quadrotor UAV and a Fixed wing UAV. Decentralized <b>anti-windup</b> compensators are designed {{to address the problem}} of magnitude saturation in Quadrotor UAVs. The developed <b>anti-windup</b> compensators are founded on an LMI-based approach previously used in literature to provide global stabilty guarantees with some level of performance guarantees. The work on the decentralized <b>anti-windup</b> compensators for Quadrotor UAVs are further improved on by replacing the use of LMIs in the determination of the anti windup compensator parameters with approximate linear based guidelines after a Lure-Postinikov Lyapunov function is used to provide global stability guarantees. This approach applies not only to Quadrotor UAVs but also to a wide class of systems that contain double integrators. The developed <b>anti-windup</b> compensators were designed and implemented for an experimental Quadrotor UAV where both simulation results and flight test results clearly show the ability of the <b>anti-windup</b> compensators to reduce the effect of magnitude saturation in Quadrotor UAVs.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{the design of a}} {{controller}} for a multi-vectored propeller airship is addressed. The controller includes <b>anti-windup</b> that takes into account unsymmetrical actuator constraints. First, a linear transformation is applied to transform the unsymmetrical constraints into symmetric constraints with an amplitude-bounded exogenous disturbance. Then, a stability condition based on a quadratic Lyapunov function for the saturated closed-loop system is proposed. The condition considers both amplitude-bounded and energy-bounded exogenous disturbances. Thus, the controller design problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem expressed in a bilinear matrix inequality form. Two controller design methods were applied: one-step controller and traditional <b>anti-windup</b> controller. The one-step method obtains the controller and the <b>anti-windup</b> compensator in one step while the <b>anti-windup</b> controller method separates this process into the linear controller design and the compensator design. Simulation results showed that both controllers enlarge the stability zone of the saturation system and have good tracking performance.

In comparison with {{the design of a}} non-switching <b>anti-windup</b> gain which maximizes a contractively invariant level set of a single quadratic Lyapunov function as a way to increase the size of the domain of attraction, the use of multiple Lyapunov functions and switching in the proposed design allows the union of the level sets of the multiple Lyapunov functions, each of which is not necessarily contractively invariant, to be contractively invariant and within the domain of attraction. As a result, the resulting domain of attraction is expected to be significantly larger than the one resulting from a single <b>anti-windup</b> gain and a single Lyapunov function.

40|$|<b>Anti-windup</b> {{strategies}} {{for dealing with}} input constraints date from the earliest stages of automatic control. They are ad-hoc procedures which achieve input saturation in an instantaneous fashion. Not surprisingly, <b>anti-windup</b> methods have a strong appeal to practitioners because of their simplicity. On the other hand, model predictive control (MPC) is a well established strategy for dealing with input constraint problems. The essential feature of the method is a receding horizon optimal quadratic control problem which is solved subject to input constraints. Both methods are known to perform well in practice and each has its strong advocates. In this paper, we explore connections between the methods for constrained single-input linear systems. In particular, we show that there are cases in which <b>anti-windup</b> schemes are identical to MPC schemes. In other cases, we show that <b>anti-windup</b> has performance which is close to that of MPC strategies.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} <b>anti-windup</b> {{scheme for}} input-output linearization is developed. The synthesis scheme employs a state-dependent constraint operator, a mapping {{of the physical}} constraints onto the transformed input, within a linear model-based <b>anti-windup</b> approach. The resultant nonlinear <b>anti-windup</b> controller is shown to solve an instantaneous 1 -norm minimization to guarantee closed-loop performance. Nominal closed-loop stability conditions are obtained using conic sector bounds and nonlinear μ-analysis. The application of the 2 ̆ 2 constraint-mapping 2 ̆ 2 <b>anti-windup</b> approach for two reactor case studies resulted in a performance improvement over comparable linear control strategies. ^ The partitioned nonlinear inverse serves {{as the foundation for}} a competing approach to nonlinear <b>anti-windup</b> synthesis. An extension to the nonlinear internal model control (NLIMC) framework which incorporates <b>anti-windup</b> and measured disturbance compensation is developed. For control affine systems with a characteristic matrix of a specific structure, the NLIMC-based <b>anti-windup</b> controller exactly solves an instantaneous 1 -norm minimization. A controller which approximately solves the instantaneous minimization is obtained using a two-step design procedure. For a styrene polymerization case study, the NLIMC-based <b>anti-windup</b> controller significantly outperforms a linear controller for measured disturbance rejection and a hypothetical grade change. Extensions to nonminimum phase systems are documented in theory and in application through a CSTR case study. ^ The development of controllers for constrained nonlinear systems with uncertainty and bounded unmeasured disturbances using quadratic Lyapunov theory is presented. Application of the Lyapunov-based synthesis scheme requires that the nonlinear system is converted into a linear system with state-dependent parameters. The state-dependent parameters are evaluated at the input and output bounds to obtain a polytope of linear plants which bounds the nonlinear system. A linear state-feedback controller is obtained for the polytope of linear plants which guarantees that the magnitude of the system output and the controlled input lie within specified bounds for a class of unmeasured disturbances. The boundaries of the polytope can be expanded to incorporate structured uncertainty from the nonlinear system. The controller gain is obtained by iteratively solving linear matrix inequalities. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{admitted that the}} classical conditioning technique is restricted to some application conditions like the bi-property of the controller and its inverse stability. Some extensions to overcome these restrictions are recalled in the paper. The conditioning technique has been conceived and must always be considered as an a posteriori <b>anti-windup</b> method (the a priori knowledge of the non-linearity acting on the desired control variable has not to be known, provided a post-measurement of the actual control variable is available). Hence, this kind of "feedback" <b>anti-windup</b> should always be used because it is never possible to prejudge of any non-linearity that could appear. However, when an a priori knowledge of some non-linearities is available, {{it is possible to}} include this knowledge either in the synthesis of the controller or in the design of a "feedforward" <b>anti-windup.</b> Two methods of feedforward <b>anti-windup</b> are given in the paper, namely the optimal conditioning and the predictive conditioning techniques.
