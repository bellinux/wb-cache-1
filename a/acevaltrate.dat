40|$|Abstract: The {{fragmentation}} pathway of <b>acevaltrate</b> {{was investigated}} by electro-spray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry．Under the positive ion mode, pseudo-molecular [M+Na] {{could be easily}} obtained，and fragmentation pathway presented a certain regularity. One of the major fragmentations observed in the collision induced dissociation(CID) spectrum was loss of branched-chain, {{and the other was}} that three-membered oxygen-containing rings would break into aldehyde. These results might be used to forecast the structures of irodoids...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} some Iranian wild species of Valerianaceae with respect to their contents of valepotriates. Identification of these compounds which are known as reliable markers in Valerianaceae family was achieved using TLC and UV-spectrophotometry methods. Valepotriates makes substantial contribution to the sedative effect of valerian. Separation of these compounds was performed by TLC using a ternary mobile phase of toluene-ethyl acetate - methyl ethyl ketone (80 : 15 : 5 v/v) on silica gel HF 254 + 366 plates. Separated bands were observed in ultraviolet light at 254 nm. For bands revelation, 2, 4 - dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) solution spray was used at visible light. For the quantitative determination of valepotriates a standardized product (Valmane ®) was used to plot two calibration curves. One calibration curve was drawn in the concentration range of 5 - 156 mg L - 1 for determination of valtrate + <b>acevaltrate</b> amounts. The second one was linear in the range of 5 - 52 mg L - 1 for didrovaltrate quantification. The qualitative and quantitative determinations were carried out in all organs of Valeriana sisymbriifolia Vahl, Valeriana alliariifolia Adams and Centranthus longiflorus Stev. (Iranian wild plant species) and commercial Valeriana officinalis L. sample. Results showed that didrovaltrate amounts (dry weight basis) ranged from 0. 13 % in inflorescence of V. alliariifolia to 3. 51 % in leaf of C. longiflorus. Also <b>acevaltrate</b> + valtrate contents varied from minimum 0. 06 % in stem of V. sisymbriifolia to maximum 10. 85 % in root of V. alliariifolia. Valepotriates contents in these species were compared to those of commercial Valeriana officinalis L. root and rhizome samples (didrovaltrate 1. 99 - 3. 23 %, valtrate + <b>acevaltrate</b> 5. 1 - 9. 26 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative stress {{has been}} {{associated}} with diverse diseases, including obesity, cancer and neurodegeneration. In fact, Valeriana jatamansi Jones (valerian) and its extracts possess strong antioxidant activities that extend their application in clinical practice to the treatment of these illnesses, even though the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Iridoid valepotriate, a characteristic iridoid ester in valerian with poor chemical stability, possesses considerable antioxidant components. The original compounds and their degradation products have been found to exhibit strong antioxidant activities. However, the relationship between their structure and antioxidant effects and the mechanism underlying their oxidation resistance remain unclear. A forced degradation study using three iridoid valepotriates (valtrate, <b>acevaltrate</b> and 1 -β <b>acevaltrate)</b> was performed in this work, and the structures of their degradation products were estimated by TLC-MS and LC-MS. Comparison of the antioxidant activities of the iridoid valepotriates before and after forced degradation revealed that degradation reduced the activities of the iridoid valepotriates in free radical scavenging and cytotoxic and cell apoptosis tests. The results suggested that the oxirane nucleus is important for defining the antioxidant profile of iridoid valepotriate. We uncovered possible mechanisms that could explain the antioxidant activities, including the generation of two hydroxyl groups through intramolecular transfer of an H• from an oxirane ring and a reduction in ROS levels through interactions with GABAergic signalling pathways...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method combined with {{diode array detection}} is described by which the valerian constituents valtrate, isovaltrate, <b>acevaltrate,</b> didrovaltrate, isovaleroxyhydroxydidrovaltrate, valerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid, {{as well as the}} valepotriate decomposition products baldrinal and homobaldrinal, can be separated and identified simultaneously. Using this procedure, roots of Valeriana officinalis, which are used for the production of phytomedicines, were analysed. The influence of different ethanol:water mixtures, used as extraction liquid, on the composition of extracts of V. officinalis is reported. The analytical procedure was also applied to a number of valerian-containing phytomedicines available on the Dutch market. In order to study the stability of the valepotriates and the formation of their decomposition product(s), samples of freshly prepared valerian tinctures were analysed after being stored at 4, 20, and 36 degrees C for up to one month...|$|E
40|$|Underground {{parts of}} three Valeriana species, namely V. officinalis L. s. l., V. wallichii DC. (V. {{jatamansi}} Jones), and V. edulis Nutt. ex Torr & Gray ssp. procera (H. B. K.) F. G. Meyer (V. mexicana DC.), {{are used in}} phytotherapy because of their mild sedative properties. Characteristic constituents of these species, which are regarded also as the active principles, were tested for cytotoxicity against GLC(4), a human small-cell lung cancer cell line, and against COLO 320, a human colorectal cancer cell line, using the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Valepotriates of the diene type (valtrate, isovaltrate and <b>acevaltrate)</b> displayed the highest cytotoxicity, with IC 50 values of 1 - 6 mu M, following continuous incubation. The monoene type valepotriates (didrovaltrate and isovaleroxyhydroxydidrovaltrate) were 2 - to 3 -fold less toxic. Baldrinal and homobaldrinal, decomposition products of valepotriates, were 10 - to 30 -fold less toxic than their parent compounds. Isovaltral had a higher cytotoxicity than its parent compound isovaltrate. Valerenic acids (valerenic acid, acetoxyvalerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and methyl valerenate), which are characteristic for V. officinalis, had a low toxicity with IC 50 values between 100 and 200 mu M. Freshly prepared and stored tinctures, prepared from roots and rhizomes of the three valerian species, were analysed for valepotriates, baldrinals and valerenic acids, and also tested for cytotoxicity. There was a clear relationship between the valepotriate contents of the freshly prepared tinctures and their toxicity. Upon storage, valepotriates decomposed, which was reflected in a significant reduction of the cytotoxic effect...|$|E
