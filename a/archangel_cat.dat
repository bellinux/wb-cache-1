50|$|The Russian Blue is a {{naturally}} occurring breed {{that may have}} originated in the port of Arkhangelsk, Russia. They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues. It is believed that sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s. The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at the Crystal Palace in England, as the <b>Archangel</b> <b>Cat.</b> The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912, when it was given its own class.|$|E

Alex died with blood trickling out of her mouth. Patrick was in hospital at the time and he'd been staring at the wall imagining the scene- the crucifix would stay, the ledges and TV sets could be dressed with <b>archangels,</b> icons and <b>cats.</b> (In the book, Alex liked cats, but Patrick preferred dogs.) So I took the photo and collaged in the props, the only trouble was it didn't look like Alex, it looked like Patrick.
