25|$|Luisa Banti {{was born}} into a well-to-do family in Florence in 1894, the oldest of six children. Her father, Guido Banti, was a {{prominent}} physician and Professor of Pathology at the University of Florence. Having inherited her father's propensity for <b>analytical</b> <b>research,</b> she defied expectations for women of her day by enrolling in the University of Florence when she was in her thirties, to study philology and classical antiquity. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the Luni site and her post-doctoral thesis on the cult of the dead in archaic Rome. Among her professors were Giacomo Devoto, who introduced her to Etruscology, and Luigi Pernier, who trained her in Etruscan archaeology.|$|E
25|$|Structuration theory allows {{researchers}} {{to focus on}} any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes ontology over epistemology. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, agent expectations, relative degrees of routine, tradition, behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and tacit knowledge, dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. Structuration theorists conduct <b>analytical</b> <b>research</b> of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We employ {{numerical}} simulations {{to investigate}} the breakup of droplets in micro- and nanoscale T junctions which are used to produce small droplets from a large droplet. A Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method was used and for verifying the accuracy of simulation the results compared with two <b>analytical</b> <b>researches.</b> Our results reveal that breakup time and breakup length of the droplets play important roles in handling these systems optimally. Our results also indicate that for nanoscale T-junctions by increasing the capillary number the performance increases while for the micro-scale systems there is a specific capillary number for which the system is in its optimum condition...|$|R
