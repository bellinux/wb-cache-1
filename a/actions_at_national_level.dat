The sample comprised 67 student teachers in their fourth year of studies for a bachelor degree {{in the department of}} French language and literature in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece. Data were collected through questionnaires which included both a structured and an open-ended part. The questionnaire’s content was based on the European Profile for Language Teacher Education — a Frame of Reference (Kelly et al 2004), which identifies 40 items as important elements in foreign language teacher education. Prominent among the findings is student teachers’ perception that the current academic curriculum should place more emphasis on teaching practice, on ways of reinforcing communication with other universities and research institutes, and on using the European Language portfolio and the European Portfolio for student teachers of languages (Newby et al. 2007). The paper concludes by proposing ways of improving the existing French language teacher education degree program and <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>national</b> <b>level</b> for restructuring language teacher education policy in Greece...|$|E

Intensified nutrition action in these countries can lead to achievement of the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and greatly increase the chances of achieving goals for child and maternal mortality (MDGs 4 and 5). Despite isolated successes in specific countries or for interventions—eg, iodised salt and vitamin A supplementation—most countries with high rates of undernutrition are failing to reach undernourished mothers and children with effective interventions supported by appropriate policies. This paper reports on an assessment of actions addressing undernutrition in the countries with the highest burden of undernutrition, drawing on systematic reviews and best-practice reports. Seven key challenges for addressing undernutrition <b>at</b> <b>national</b> <b>level</b> are defined and reported on: getting nutrition {{on the list of}} priorities, and keeping it there; doing the right things; not doing the wrong things; acting at scale; reaching those in need; data-based decisionmaking; and building strategic and operational capacity.

40|$|A World Conservation Union (IUCN) {{regional}} {{red list}} is an objective assessment of regional extinction risk {{and is not}} the same as a list of conservation priority species. Recent research reveals the widespread, but incorrect, assumption that IUCN Red List categories represent a hierarchical list of priorities for conservation action. We developed a simple eight-step priority-setting process and applied it to the conservation of bees in Ireland. Our model is based on the national red list but also considers the global significance of the national population; the conservation status at global, continental, and regional levels; key biological, economic, and societal factors; and is compatible with existing conservation agreements and legislation. Throughout Ireland, almost one-third of the bee fauna is threatened (30 of 100 species), but our methodology resulted in a reduced list of only 17 priority species. We did not use the priority species list to broadly categorize species to the conservation action required; instead, we indicated the individual action required for all threatened, near-threatened, and data-deficient species on the national red list based on the IUCN 2 ̆ 7 s conservation-actions template file. Priority species lists will strongly influence prioritization of conservation <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>national</b> <b>levels,</b> but <b>action</b> should not be exclusive to listed species.

40|$|Objectives China {{has very}} {{high rates of}} {{antibiotic}} resistance and a health care system that provides strong incentives for over-prescribing. This paper describes {{the findings of a}} qualitative study in a province of southern China that seeks to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices in relation to the use of antibiotics. Methods Semi-structured interviews with patients and health workers at provincial, county, township, and village level. Interviews used four probes (common cold, cough, mild diarrhoea and tiredness) where antibiotics were not indicated, supplemented by questions on knowledge, attitudes, and practices. These data were supplemented by two focus groups, with medical students and pharmacists, and discussions with participants <b>at</b> a <b>national</b> conference on antibiotic use. Results Coughs and diarrhoea are almost universally treated with antibiotics, while the cold is normally treated with antivirals instead or as well. Many physicians are aware that the cold is usually self-limiting but believe that they can speed recovery and that they are responding to patient expectations. Most physicians and many patients are aware of the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, although it is often seen as a property acquired by the patient and not the micro-organism. Physicians face financial incentives to prescribe, with profit splitting with pharmaceutical suppliers. Sales profits form a major part of a hospital's income. National guidance on use of antibiotics is fragmentary and incomplete. Conclusion The misuse of antibiotics poses considerable risks. Effective action will require a multi-faceted strategy including education, based on an understanding of existing beliefs, the replacement of perverse incentives with those promoting best practice, and investment in improved surveillance. Much of this will require <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>national</b> <b>level.</b> Antibiotic resistance Antibiotic prescribing Health care financing China...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{major issues}} and challenges for Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) and the livestock sector, as well as options for further development of policies or regulatory approaches. Three main areas were identified, i) how we can halt the further erosion of genetic diversity and promote sustainable breeding and use, ii) {{whether there is a}} need to regulate the exchange of genetic material and iii) how to balance different systems of rights (e. g. sovereign rights of nations, intellectual property rights, communal rights or rights of livestock keepers). To halt further erosion, complementary ex-situ and in-situ conservation approaches are needed and breeding and marketing of local breeds should be strengthened. Secondly, recognizing the importance of the exchange of AnGR, broad access and responsible and equitable exchange mechanisms should be further promoted. Thirdly, regarding intellectual property rights, {{there is a need to}} adapt the application of the patent system to the special circumstances inherent in animal breeding. Moreover, possible sui generis systems should be further explored in order to better balance different rights systems. Rather than developing a new or adapted internationally legally binding framework, the intergovernmental process under FAO may instead wish to focus, in the first instance, on the development of voluntary instruments to strengthen national policies and the implementation of <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>national</b> <b>levels.</b> Debates and developments related to international agreements in the crop sector have also tended to frame the debate for AnGR.

In the analysis, the strategic plans of five leading global cities are compared with those of sixteen Turkish cities. While the leading global cities have specific managerial approaches to mitigate climate change, none of the Turkish cities exhibits any comprehensive approach. Furthermore, while leading global cities modify urban services to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, few Turkish cities adjust any services to address this challenge. Some Turkish cities propose an increased use of renewable energy sources and modification in their transportation system, but the focus in these plans is the current daily needs of their inhabitants.
