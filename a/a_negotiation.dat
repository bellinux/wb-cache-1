5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates <b>a</b> <b>negotiation.</b> For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. <b>A</b> <b>negotiation</b> can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the party can talk with demons they encounter, and through <b>a</b> <b>negotiation</b> process {{persuade them to}} join their party. Using a special location in the game world, players can fuse two different demons into a new demon, with the new demon inheriting skills from both its parents. The choices made by the protagonist during the story impact which demons can be recruited. The attitude of demons towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, hedge fund, activist {{investor}} and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper {{reduce its}} cash reserves and cut costs, before Kheradpir was officially appointed. That February, Juniper {{reached an agreement}} with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board. That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses. In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in <b>a</b> <b>negotiation</b> with an unnamed Juniper customer. An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the tribute}} and <b>a</b> <b>negotiation</b> between Laoshang Chanyu (r.174–160 BC) and Emperor Wen (r.180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, {{many of the}} Chanyu's Xiongnu {{subordinates}} chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods. In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving {{the assassination of the}} Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established agricultural colonies to strengthen their hold. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of Mobei, where the Han commanders Huo Qubing (d.117 BC) and Wei Qing (d.106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert.|$|E
25|$|Face-saving – This {{approach}} {{refers to}} justifying a stance based on one's previously expressed principles and values in <b>a</b> <b>negotiation.</b> This approach to an issue is less arbitrary, and thus, {{it is more}} understandable from the opposing party's perspective.|$|E
25|$|Make {{emotions}} {{explicit and}} validate - Taking a more proactive approach in discussing one's emotions can allow for <b>a</b> <b>negotiation</b> {{to focus on}} the problem itself, rather than any unexpressed feelings. It is important to allow both parties to share any emotions he or she may have.|$|E

25|$|Communication is a {{key element}} of {{negotiation}}. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in <b>a</b> <b>negotiation</b> communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.|$|E

The author compares face-to-face negotiation outcomes with computermediated <b>negotiation</b> outcomes using <b>an</b> integrative (win-win) <b>negotiation.</b> There were two main results of interest. First, computer-mediated final agreements are somewhat more integrative than those negotiated face-to-face, suggesting there is no efficiency loss from negotiating long distance using information technology. Second, computer-mediated agreements tend to be significantly more equal than face-to-face agreements...|$|R
25|$|Due to {{globalization}} and growing business trends, negotiation {{in the form}} of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the amount of blunder, and increases familiarity in <b>a</b> <b>negotiation.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{people get}} on well, {{the outcome of}} <b>a</b> <b>negotiation</b> {{is likely to be}} more positive.

It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement. Mirroring can help create trust and establish a relationship.|$|E
