40|$|The yeasts {{constitute}} {{a large and}} heterogeneous group of microorganisms that are currently attracting increased attention from scientists and industry. Numerous and diverse biological activities make them promising candidates {{for a wide range}} of applications not limited to the food sector. In addition to their major contribution to flavor development in fermented foods, their antagonistic activities toward undesirable bacteria and fungi are now widely known. These activities are associated with their competitiveness for nutrients, acidification of their growth medium, their tolerance of high concentrations of ethanol, and release of antimicrobial compounds such as antifungal killer toxins or mycocins and antibacterial compounds. While the design of foods containing probiotics (microorganisms that confer health benefits) has focused primarily on Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii has long been known effective for treating gastroenteritis. In this review, the antimicrobial activities of yeasts are examined. Mechanisms underlying this antagonistic activity as well as recent applications of these biologically <b>active</b> <b>yeasts</b> in both the medical and veterinary sectors are described...|$|E
40|$|A {{new family}} of {{fluorescent}} probes {{has been developed}} for assessing the viability and metabolic activity of yeasts. This class of halogenated unsymmetric cyanine dyes is exemplified by the FUN- 1 [2 -chloro- 4 -(2, 3 -dihydro- 3 -methyl-(benzo- 1, 3 -thiazol- 2 -yl) - methylidene) - 1 -phenylquinolinium iodide] stain, a membrane-permeant nucleic acid-binding dye that {{has been found to}} give rise to cylindrical intravacuolar structures (CIVS) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Biochemical processing of the dye by <b>active</b> <b>yeasts</b> yielded CIVS that were markedly red shifted in fluorescence emission and therefore spectrally distinct from the nucleic acid-bound form of the dye. The formation of CIVS occurred under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and was highly temperature dependent. Treatment of yeasts with the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2 -deoxy-D-glucose reduced cellular ATP levels approximately 6 -fold and completely inhibited CIVS formation. Under aerobic conditions, the formation of CIVS was abrogated by the cytochrome oxidase inhibitors azide and cyanide; however, the H+ transport uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited CIVS formation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Depletion of cellular thiols, including glutathione, with millimolar concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, or allyl alcohol completely inhibited CIVS production. Marked reduction in the formation of CIVS by ethacrynic acid and sulfobromophthalein, inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, suggested that dye processing can involve enzyme-mediated formation of glutathione conjugates. The conversion of FUN- 1 by S. cerevisiae was studied quantitatively by using several techniques, including fluorometry, flow cytometry, and wide-field and confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy...|$|E

MethodsTwenty-three clinical isolates of Candida with different susceptibility patterns were treated for 1 h with two concentrations each of Am B (2 and 8 mg/L), Flu (8 and 64 mg/L) and 5 -FC (4 and 32 mg/L), followed by staining with three different fluorochromes, under conditions previously defined through an optimisation study. These were 1 mg/L propidium iodide (PI) / 106 cells for 30 min at 30 °C (a marker that only penetrates cells with severe lesions of the membrane); 0. 5 μm FUN- 1 / 106 cells for 30 min at 30 °C (a fluorescent probe which after entering the yeast cell is converted, by metabolically <b>active</b> <b>yeasts,</b> from a diffuse cytosolic pool with a yellow-green fluorescence into red cylindrical intravacuolar structures) and 0. 25 μm of JC- 1 / 106 cells for 15 min at 37 °C (a monomer that changes reversibly from green to red the J-aggregates, with the increased membrane potential). About 50000 yeast cells were analysed by flow cytometry (FCM), at FL 3 (red, 620 nm) for PI and FL 2 (yellow–green, 575 nm) for FUN- 1 and the ratio of FL 3 to FL 1 was determined (red, 620 nm/green, 525 nm) for JC- 1; 200 cells of each suspension were also analysed by epifluorescence microscopy (EPM). Viability studies were performed in parallel to count the number of colony forming units. ResultsSusceptible (S) strains exposed to Am B and stained with JC- 1 showed a dose-dependent decrease in the mitochondrial potential, i. e. a decreased ratio between red/green fluorescence by FCM and a decrease in J-aggregates by EPM. Neither FUN- 1 nor PI was useful in the study of Am B activity. Susceptibility to Flu and 5 -FC could be detected with FUN- 1 staining: metabolic changes were detected by an increase in yellow–green intensity of fluorescence by FCM or a decrease of cylindrical intravacuolar structure formation by EPM, although no decrease in total viability was registered. Staining with JC- 1 could predict resistance to both drugs, but did not allow distinction between sensitive dose-dependent strains (S-DD) or intermediate (I) resistance to Flu or 5 -FC, respectively, from S strains. PI did not stain Candida cells treated with Flu or 5 -FC under our experimental conditions. ConclusionSusceptibility patterns of Candida strains to AmB can be determined by using JC- 1, and to Flu and 5 -FC by using FUN- 1. PI was not a useful probe with which to study the effect of such antifungals under the conditions described here...|$|E
