5|$|Following the United States Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004), which {{established}} that detainees {{had the right}} of habeas corpus to challenge their detention, Hamdan was granted a review before the Combatant Status Review Tribunal. It determined that he was eligible for detention by the United States as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> or person of interest.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} have interpreted this {{to mean that}} if the President says you are <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant,</b> then you effectively are.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the Department of Defense started Combatant Status Review Tribunals {{of all the}} Guantanamo detainees to {{determine}} whether each was <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> or not. The tribunals extended from July 2004 through March 2005.|$|E
50|$|The term lawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> {{is defined}} in the Military Commissions Act of 2006; the term is used as an exclusionary term to prevent {{most of those who}} qualify under the {{definition}} from being <b>an</b> unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b>|$|R

25|$|Mamdouh Habib is an Egyptian and Australian citizen with dual nationality, {{best known}} for having been held {{for more than three}} years by the United States as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant,</b> by both the CIA and {{military}} authorities. He was sent by extraordinary rendition from Pakistan to Egypt after arrest, in violation of international law. He was held the longest at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b> Finally released without charges in January 2005, Habib struggled to have his account of his experiences believed, as he alleged he had been tortured by the CIA, Egyptians, and US military, at times with Australian intelligence officers present. For some time, each of the governments denied his allegations, but they have gradually been confirmed.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Accounts differ. Khadr {{claims he}} lived {{for nine months}} in a CIA safe house near the American Embassy in Kabul, and worked abroad as an informant. But other sources say {{he was taken to}} Guantanamo Bay on March 21, 2003 and held as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{pilot of}} the Liberator, Flying Officer Lloyd Allan Trigg RNZAF was {{subsequently}} awarded the Victoria Cross for this action. This {{is the only}} time such a decoration has been awarded solely on the testimony of <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> and was the first to be awarded to ASW (anti-submarine-warfare) aircrew.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} motions {{filed in}} October 2006, {{argued that the}} case should be dismissed because the government took too much time between arresting Padilla and charging him. In essence, the argument was that for constitutional speedy trial purposes, the arrest took place prior to his detention as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> and not when he was transferred to civilian custody.|$|E
25|$|According to his father, Hamdi went to Afghanistan in {{the late}} summer of 2001 as a relief worker.

25|$|Begg {{was held}} in Guantanamo Bay for just under two years, the first almost 600 days of which were spent in solitary confinement.

He was not charged with any crime and {{was not allowed to}} consult legal counsel {{for the majority of the}} time he spent there.|$|E
25|$|These {{cases were}} each {{filed in the}} United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the court decided them together, {{consolidating}} them under Rasul v. Bush.

25|$|United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King {{suggested}} that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, {{should be tried}} as an unlawful enemy combatant {{rather than as a}} criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Salim Ahmed Hamdan (...)

Bush designated him <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> and, arguing {{that he was not}} entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison. He had converted to Islam while serving his last jail sentence in prison, and went to Pakistan where he was recruited into Al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|Mukasey also {{presided over}} the trial of Jose Padilla, ruling that the U.S. citizen and alleged {{terrorist}} could be held as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> but was entitled to see his lawyers. Mukasey also was {{the judge in the}} litigation between developer Larry Silverstein and several insurance companies arising from the destruction of the World Trade Center. In a 2003 suit, he issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Motion Picture Association of America from enforcing its ban against the distribution of screener copies of films during awards season, ruling that the ban was likely an unlawful restraint of trade unfair to independent filmmakers.|$|E

50|$|The Brennan Center opposes mass incarceration and {{produces}} research on causes {{of violent crime}} in the United States. The Brennan Center has represented several detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and also U.S. citizens or legal residents held as unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants.</b> Attorneys from the Center challenged a U.S. President's authority to declare a prisoner to be <b>an</b> unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> {{in the fight against}} terrorism. The Center has also challenged the U.S. Congress’s power to deny habeas corpus to such prisoners.|$|R
25|$|Ahmad went to Afghanistan and, {{after the}} United States intervention, {{tried to escape}} through Pakistan. He was arrested by Pakistani {{soldiers}} and transferred to United States military custody {{in the fall of}} 2001.

25|$|Murat Kurnaz {{is a young}} Turkish {{citizen who}} was born in, and had grown up, in Germany. When captured, {{he was close to}} being granted German citizenship, which {{children}} of guest workers are required to apply for in a separate process when they come of age. While on a trip to Pakistan in the fall of 2001, he was taken off a tourist bus and detained, then transferred to United States custody.

25|$|In {{regard to}} the {{detention}} of detainees without charge, in section I of the O'Connor plurality opinion, the plurality relied on the time-honored traditions of war, the Geneva Convention, and {{a long list of}} other international treaties, to hold that the government had authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) to hold any enemy combatants, provided enemy combatants had been seized on the battlefield participating in active hostilities, for the sole objective of preventing <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> from returning to the battlefield, and then only so long as there continued to be “active hostilities.” The plurality held that such protective detention could be applied to both citizen and non-citizen enemy combatants.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, during 1999, Hicks {{converted}} to Islam {{and took the}} name Muhammed Dawood (محمد داود). He was later reported to have been publicly denounced due to his lack of religious observance. Hicks was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001 by the Afghan Northern Alliance and sold for a US$5,000 bounty to the United States military. He was transported to Guantanamo Bay where he was designated <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b> He alleges that during his detention, he was tortured via anal examination. The United States first filed charges against Hicks in 2004 under a military commission system newly created by Presidential Order. Those proceedings failed in 2006 when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, that the military commission system was unconstitutional. The military commission system was re-established {{by an act of}} the United States Congress.|$|E
40|$|Commissions Act of 2006 ” 1 {{a law to}} “authorize {{trial by}} {{military}} commission for violations {{of the law of}} war, and for other purposes. ” 2 The law contains several controversial provisions, in particular: • The delegation of authority to define a person as <b>an</b> “unlawful <b>enemy</b> combatant” to the executive branch without any avenue for appeal. 3 • The exemption of military commissions from several key provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including section 810, which reads, “When any person subject to this chapter is placed in arrest or confinement prior to trial, immediate steps shall be taken to inform him of the specific wrong of which he is accused and to try him or to dismiss the charges and release him. ” • The refusal to allow alien unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants</b> to invoke rights under the Geneva Conventions. 4 • The allowance of statements obtained under “disputed ” levels of coercion. 5 • The establishment of restrictions on when the accused may be present during his trial. 6 • The (probable) restriction of access to counsel. 7 There also seem to be ambiguities in the law with respect to the rights of American citizens. The reason for the ambiguity is that the jurisdiction of military commissions is limited to “try any offense…by <b>an</b> alien <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> … 8 However, the definition of <b>an</b> “unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> ” extends to: a person [meaning any person] who before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be <b>an</b> unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> by <b>a</b> Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President… 1 th 109 Congress 2 d Session S. 3930 (hereafter Military Commissions Act of 2006 or MCA...|$|R

25|$|On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. It also {{considered}} whether the Supreme Court had the jurisdiction {{to enforce the}} articles of the 1949 Geneva convention and whether Congress {{had the power to}} prevent the Court from reviewing the case of <b>an</b> accused <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> before it was tried by a military commission, as had happened in this case. It asserted it had that authority.|$|R
