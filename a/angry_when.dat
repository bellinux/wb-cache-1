30|$|If {{a worker}} is angry, we must {{subtract}} from his utility a term λ(π + p−w), where p is {{the productivity of}} the worker in the firm, and π is the profit the firm obtains from the other workers. This term is just a “spite” term: <b>when</b> <b>angry,</b> the worker dislikes the firms making a profit, and he is <b>angrier</b> <b>when</b> he contributes to those profits. What triggers anger is that the individual rejects {{the hypothesis that the}} firm is altruistic.|$|R

5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer. Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became <b>angry</b> <b>when</b> challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E
50|$|For his part, he was {{disgusted by}} the administration. He {{believed}} its economic policies were terrible for the country. On {{top of the}} overvalued lira, the government ran huge deficits financed by printing money. Predictably, this led to inflation.

Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} <b>angry</b> <b>when</b> they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry that he actually made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Commission on Human Rights {{came under}} fire during its {{existence}} for the high-profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee {{the human rights of}} their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also <b>angry</b> <b>when</b> it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because of these problems that Kofi Annan in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.|$|E
