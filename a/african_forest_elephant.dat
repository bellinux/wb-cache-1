5|$|Elephants {{are large}} mammals {{of the family}} Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Three species are {{currently}} recognized: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephant</b> (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.|$|E

25|$|As the bonobos' {{habitat is}} shared with people, the {{ultimate}} success of conservation efforts still rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people is salient in the Cuvette Centrale the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities {{have often been}} driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephant,</b> and other species have been severely devastated by poachers and the thriving bushmeat trade. In contrast, areas exist where the bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.|$|E
500|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the {{complete}} mitochondrial genome (inherited through the female line) showed that two examined Columbian mammoths, including the morphologically typical [...] "Huntington mammoth", were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. One possible explanation is introgression of a haplogroup from woolly to Columbian mammoths, or vice versa. A similar situation has been documented in modern species of African elephant (Loxodonta), the African bush elephant (L.africana) and the <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephant</b> (L.cyclotis). The authors of the study also suggest that the North American type formerly referred to as M.jeffersonii {{may have been a}} hybrid between the two species, as it is apparently morphologically intermediate. These findings were not expected by scientists; nuclear DNA and more specimens will have to be examined to clarify the situation.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>{{elephant}}s</b> {{travel in}} smaller groups than other elephant species. A typical group size consists of 2 to 8 individuals. The average family unit is 3 to 5 individuals, usually {{made up of}} female relatives. Most family groups are a mother and several of her offspring, or several groups of females and their offspring that interact with one another, especially at forest clearings. Female offspring are philopatric, male offspring disperse at maturity. Unlike African savanna <b>elephants</b> (Loxodonta africana), <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> (Loxodonta cyclotis) do not usually interact with other family groups. Male <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> tend to be solitary and only associate with other elephants during the mating season. Males have a dominance hierarchy based on size.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s, {{a strand of}} {{scholarship}} {{has argued that the}} <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> used by Numidia, the Ptolemies and the military of Carthage did not carry howdahs or turrets in combat, perhaps owing to the physical weakness of the species. Some allusions to turrets in ancient literature are certainly anachronistic or poetic invention, but other references are less easily discounted. There is explicit contemporary testimony that the army of Juba I of Numidia included turreted elephants in 46 BC. This is confirmed by the image of a turreted African elephant used on the coinage of Juba II. This also appears to be the case with Ptolemaic armies: Polybius reports that at the battle of Raphia in 217 BC the elephants of Ptolemy IV carried turrets; these elephants were significantly smaller than the Asian elephants fielded by the Seleucids and so presumably <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants.</b> There is also evidence that Carthaginian war elephants were furnished with turrets and howdahs in certain military contexts.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 500 <b>African</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Elephants</b> {{remain in}} the {{northern}} forests of the park. As in so much of its range, the <b>forest</b> <b>elephant</b> was hunted to local extinction {{in the south of}} the park. Also in the north, the Okapi, a rainforest giraffe and Congolese endemic, occurs only on {{the west bank of the}} Lomami. This finding raises questions about the historic range of the species since the Okapi is known also on the east bank of Lualaba River but not between the Lomami and Lualaba.|$|R
5000|$|<b>African</b> <b>forest</b> elephants: Cornell University's Elephant Listening Project {{began in}} 1999 when Katy Payne began {{studying}} the calls of <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> in Dzanga National Park in the Central African Republic. Andrea Turkalo has continued Payne's work in Dzanga National Park observing elephant communication. For nearly 20 years, Turkalo {{has spent the}} majority of her time using a spectrogram to record the noises that the elephants make. After extensive observation and research, she {{has been able to}} recognize elephants by their voices. Researchers hope to translate these voices into an elephant dictionary, but that will likely not occur for many years. Because elephant calls are often made at very low frequencies, this spectrogram is able to detect lower frequencies that human ears are unable to hear, allowing Turkalo to get a better idea of what she perceives the elephants to be saying. Cornell’s research on <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> has challenged the idea that humans are considerably better at using language and that animals only have a small repertoire of information that they can convey to others. As Turkalo explained on 60 Minutes’ “The Secret Language of Elephants,” “Many of their calls are in some ways similar to human speech." ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the park}} has been poorly explored, over 350 bird species have been recorded. It {{is one of the}} two parts of Nigeria where Xavier's greenbul is found. Other species unusual in Nigeria include bat hawk, Cassin's hawk-eagle, crested guineafowl, grey-throated rail, olive long-tailed cuckoo, bare-cheeked trogon, lyre-tailed honeyguide, green-backed bulbul, grey-throated tit-flycatcher and Rachel's malimbe.42 species of snake have been counted.There are at least 75 mammal species, {{including}} the African buffalo, the endangered <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants,</b> common chimpanzee, Preuss's red colobus and Sclater's guenon and the highly endangered drill.The division may contain 400 chimpanzees, although no survey has been undertaken.|$|R
50|$|Elephants {{in captivity}} refers most often to {{elephants}} either born in captivity, {{such as a}} zoo, circus, or camp, or have been imported from the wild. Most captive elephants are Asian elephants. Selective breeding of elephants is impractical due to their long reproductive cycle, {{so there are no}} domestic breeds. African bush <b>elephants</b> and <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> are less amenable to training. There are estimated to be 15,000 to 20,000 elephants in captivity, of a total population of 40,000 to 50,000. Historically, elephants in zoos and circuses were taken from the wild; today, many are born in captivity.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> are {{estimated}} to constitute up to one-third of the continent's elephant population, but have been poorly studied {{because of the difficulty}} in observing them through the dense vegetation that makes up their habitat. Thermal imaging has facilitated observation of the species, leading to more information on their ecology, numbers, and behavior, including their interactions with elephants and other species. Scientists have learned more about how the elephants, who have poor night vision, negotiate their environment using only their hearing and olfactory senses. They also appeared to be much more active sexually during night compared to the day, which was unexpected.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{evidence}} cited in MSW3 is morphological. The <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephant</b> has a longer and narrower mandible, rounder ears, a different number of toenails, straighter and downward tusks, and considerably smaller size. With regard {{to the number of}} toenails: the African bush elephant normally has four toenails on the front foot and three on the hind feet, the <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephant</b> normally has five toenails on the front foot and four on the hind foot (like the Asian elephant), but hybrids between the two species commonly occur.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>{{elephant}}</b> (Loxodonta cyclotis) is a forest-dwelling {{species of}} elephant {{found in the}} Congo Basin. It is {{the smallest of the}} three extant species of elephant, but still one of the largest living terrestrial animals. The <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephant</b> and the African bush elephant, L. africana, were considered to be one species until genetic studies indicated that they separated an estimated 2-7 million years ago. Due to a slower birth rate, the forest elephant takes longer to recover from poaching, which caused its population to fall by 65% from 2002 to 2014.|$|E

5000|$|Bivitellobilharzia nairi, {{common name}} {{elephant}} schistosome, {{is part of}} the family Schistosomatidae. It is most closely related to the blood fluke Bivitellobilharzia loxodontae, which uses <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> (Loxodonta cyclotis) as a definitive host. Each of these schistosomes, {{that are part of the}} genus Bivitellobilharzia, sit near the base of a branch within the schistosome family that contains mammal-infecting species.This is a fairly new identified endoparasite that was found in 1955 by Mudaliar and Ramanujachari, who first recorded the parasite in India. Researchers collected fecal samples of the Indian rhinoceros and were startled to find B. nairi eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Dzanga-Sangha Forest Reserve is ecologically {{rich and}} {{contains}} {{a variety of}} megafauna such as western lowland gorillas, <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants,</b> bongo antelopes, <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> buffalos, white-nosed and moustache monkeys, grey-cheeked mangabeys, bushpigs, duikers, and many different bird species. Of particular note, though, are the western lowland gorillas and <b>forest</b> <b>elephants.</b> Dzanga-Sangha <b>Forest</b> Reserve {{has one of the}} highest population densities of gorillas in the world with an estimated 2000 of them living within the reserve's precincts. Since the establishment of the reserve it has been an important location for research into the western lowland gorillas [...] and <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> in particular. A number of papers have been published by naturalists working with the park, including the leading expert in the world on <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> Andrea Turkalo, and Mike Fay (J. M. Fay) and Marcellin Agnagna. There are thousands of insect species. Rodent species include cane rat, giant rat, and porcupine. The reserve is also noted for its dark-crowned forest eagles which have an average wingspan of 1.55 metres and the blue-breasted kingfisher.|$|R
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>forest</b> elephants– taxonomically and {{functionally}} unique–are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide {{information on}} the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for <b>forest</b> <b>elephants</b> (80 foot-surveys; covering 13, 000 km; 91, 600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62 % between 2002 – 2011, and the taxon lost 30 % of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10 % of its potential size, occupying less than 25 % of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining <b>African</b> <b>forest</b> <b>elephants,</b> illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced. Peer reviewe...|$|R
