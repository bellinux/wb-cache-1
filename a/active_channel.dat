40|$|AbstractWe have {{expressed}} active ATP-sensitive K-channels (KATP charmels) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9) cells using a baculovirus vector. A high yield of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> was obtained on co-infection with SUR 1 and Kir 6. 2 engineered to contain N- and/or C-terminal tags to permit detection by Western blotting. Channel activity was sensitive to ATP, glibenclamide and diazoxide. Channel activity was also obtained on {{expression of a}} C-terminally truncated Kir 6. 2 (Kir 6. 2 ΔC 26) : these channels were blocked by ATP but were insensitive to sulphonylureas. In contrast to Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells the full length Kir 6. 2 also gave rise to <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> in Sf 9 cells when expressed alone. The highest yield of <b>active</b> KATP <b>channels</b> was obtained on infection with a fusion protein containing SUR 1 linked to Kir 6. 2 ΔC 26 via a 6 -amino acid linker...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of frequency-hopping systems on interference-limited HF channels, so-called adap- tive frequency-hopping (AFH), which uses an adaptively se- lected pool of the "best" hopping-frequencies for the communication, has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the adaptivity of the AFH scheme by adjusting the transmitred power on each channel individually and by adaptively changing the number Na of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> that are selected to the pool. Fewer <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> (up to a certain point) give improved communication performance since the used channels, on the average, are less interfered. However, by decreasing Na, the protection against hostile detection is decreased. This trade-off between communication and LPI performance with respect to N {{is shown in the}} paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 23 rd September 2018. A {{long-term}} production stability of oil-in-water emulsions by microchannel (step) emulsification was investigated using two cross flow silicon chips consisting of 540 or 1, 850 microchannels fabricated on 10 parallel terraces. Each terrace was 9. 54 mm long {{and consisted of}} 54 channels with a depth of 5 µm and a width of 18 µm (chip 1) or 185 channels with a depth of 4 µm and a width of 8 µm (chip 2). The dispersed phase {{was a mixture of}} 2 wt% polycaprolactone (PCL) and 1 wt% poly(d,l-lactic) acid (PLA) dissolved in dichloromethane and the continuous phase was 2 wt% poly(vinyl alcohol). After solvent evaporation, the droplets were transformed into highly uniform composite polymer particles with an average diameter of 8. 8 or 4. 9 µm. The percentages of <b>active</b> <b>channels,</b> droplet sizes and droplet generation frequencies at individual terraces were investigated in both chips to reveal any flow maldistribution. After 6 h of production in chip 1, overall 95 % of the channels produced droplets and the percentage of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> on each terrace was at least 91 %. The percentage of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> decreased by decreasing the size of the channels. The mean droplet size varied negligibly across individual terraces over 7 h. Slightly higher droplet generation frequencies and smaller percentages of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> were observed at central terraces. The droplet generation frequencies at the channels located close to each other were similar, indicating that droplet formation dynamics was coupled. The droplet size was not affected by the dispersed phase flow rate...|$|R
