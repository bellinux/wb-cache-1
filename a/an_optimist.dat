She is an {{intelligent}} and creative girl, but is seen by others as strange, and is ostracised largely due to her androgynous dress sense. Alo Creevey (Will Merrick), something of <b>an</b> <b>optimist,</b> loves his dog and his van foremost. He is best friends with Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold), a boy from a very middle-class home who immerses himself in heavy metal subculture. He uses musical elitism as a means to cover up his own shyness when, among other things, interacting with girls.|$|E
25|$|However, both Trajan and Decebalus {{considered}} this only a temporary truce, and readied themselves for renewed war. Trajan had Greek engineer Apollodorus of Damascus construct a stone {{bridge over the}} Danube river, while Decebalus secretly plotted alliances against the Romans(citation needed). In 105, Trajan crossed the Danube river and besieged Decebalus' capital, Sarmizegetusa, but the siege failed because of Decebalus' allied tribes. However, Trajan was <b>an</b> <b>optimist.</b> He returned with a newly constituted army and took Sarmizegetusa by treachery. Decebalus fled into the mountains, but was cornered by pursuing Roman cavalry. Decebalus committed suicide rather than being captured by the Romans and be paraded as a slave, then be killed. The Roman captain took his head and right hand to Trajan, who had them displayed in the Forums. Trajan's Column in Rome was constructed to celebrate the conquest of Dacia.|$|E

Shankly developed his skills to the point that he was unemployed for only a few months before Carlisle United signed him. He wrote that he had his football future worked out in his mind and that, even when working in the pit, he was only [...] "killing time". He always believed that {{it was only a matter}} of time before he became a professional player.

[...] His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write. [...] Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well. In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels.

500|$|Literary {{historian}} Tudor Vianu {{notes the}} influence exercised on Cerna and other traditionalists by Mihai Eminescu, Romania's major mid-19th century Classicist and Junimist poet. modernist theorist Eugen Lovinescu {{also believes that}} the [...] "matter in which [...] worked" [...] was largely [...] "dominated by Eminescu." [...] He also cautions {{that there is a}} major difference between the two: Cerna is <b>an</b> <b>optimist,</b> while Eminescu most often projected a pessimistic attitude. According to Zarifopol, the poet considered himself an [...] "improved follower" [...] of Eminescu. Cerna was also a late admirer of Lord Byron, a main figure of English Romanticism, and translated from his Childe Harold. One of Cerna's poems was an epic piece inspired by the Book of Genesis, where Adam confronts God. Titled Plânsetul lui Adam, it builds on themes which recalled Byron's 1821 play Cain, and constituted an interrogation of divine laws.|$|E

500|$|This companion, Martin, is a Manichaean scholar {{based on}} the real-life pessimist Pierre Bayle, who was a chief {{opponent}} of Leibniz. For {{the remainder of the}} voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains <b>an</b> <b>optimist</b> at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour to Bordeaux and Paris, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based on Admiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time [...] "pour l'encouragement des autres" [...] (to encourage the others). Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival in Venice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis, in Venice. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with a Theatine monk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousand piastres to Paquette and one thousand to Brother Giroflée.|$|E
500|$|Naruto {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a coming-of-age story. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. [...] In Yukari Fujimoto's view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear. [...] Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (<b>an</b> <b>optimist)</b> as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: [...] "Naruto’s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge". [...] Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. [...] Shōnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn! from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view {{this is part of the}} reason for the change in emphasis: Naruto [...] "was not supposed to provide laughter anymore".|$|E
500|$|Manga, anime, {{and video}} game {{publications}} {{and other related}} media have both praised and criticised Sasuke's character. GameSpot's Joe Donson extolled Sasuke's abilities as [...] "badass" [...] but echoed IGN's comments about his [...] "emo" [...] personality. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews noted that Sasuke fell into the stereotypical [...] "rival" [...] mold of shōnen manga and found him unlikable. On the other hand, Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure praised the fact that Naruto and Sasuke are forced to work together despite their rivalry. Moure liked that, despite their constant competition, [...] "the group [...] come together when they need to". A study which examined whether readers could predict character types based on physical cues found Sasuke to be a ISTJ (Myers-Briggs) character type, making him a foil for Naruto's personality.

[...] Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto are intended to add additional layers to the story, including Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa. These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that {{he has the ability to}} [...] "blow away" [...] the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox creature sealed inside Naruto.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his father}} died prematurely, ca. 1901, Nemțeanu was the family's sole breadwinner, finding {{employment}} as an office intern. He managed to attend high school in Galați, his first published work appearing in the local weekly Înainte, in 1904, followed by contributions in the Bucharest review Dumineca. He continued to educate himself at night school although, by then, he was already showing signs of tuberculosis. <b>An</b> <b>optimist,</b> he believed that he would eventually be cured. Nemțeanu also frequented the local literary circles of Galați and Western Moldavia at large, befriending writers Avram Steuerman-Rodion and Ion Pribeagu, and later also Barbu Lăzăreanu, Eugeniu Botez and Constantin Graur. He wanted to achieve literary fame on his own, and organized a poetry festival with funds collected from the community of merchants and artisans. When one complained that the tickets were expensive, at 5 lei a piece, Nemțeanu answered back: [...] "pay 5 now or in two years you'll be paying 20 for my statue." [...] According to a 1921 note in Cele Trei Crișuri, [...] "dropped {{into a world of}} misery from his adolescent years, he took all that fate threw at him with the resignation of his kind soul and with a gentle smile—that was often ironic, jaded—on his apparently serene face." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{main object}} of the Moralists is to propound a system of natural theology, and to vindicate, so far as natural {{religion}} is concerned, the ways of God to man. The articles of Shaftesbury's religious creed were few and simple, but these he entertained with a conviction amounting to enthusiasm. They may briefly be summed up as a belief in one God whose most characteristic attribute is universal benevolence, in the moral government of the universe, and in a future state of man making up for the imperfections and repairing the inequalities of the present life. Shaftesbury is emphatically <b>an</b> <b>optimist,</b> {{but there is a}} passage in the Moralists (pt. ii. sect. 4) which would lead us to suppose that he regarded matter as an indifferent principle, coexistent and coeternal with God, limiting His operations, and the cause of the evil and imperfection which, notwithstanding the benevolence of the Creator, is still to be found in His work. If this view of his optimism be correct, Shaftesbury, as Mill says of Leibniz, must be regarded as maintaining, not that this is the best of all imaginable but only of all possible worlds. This brief notice of Shaftesbury's scheme of natural religion would be conspicuously imperfect unless it were added that it is popularized in Pope's Essay on Man, several lines of which, especially of the first epistle, are simply statements from the Moralists done into verse. Whether, however, these were taken immediately by Pope from Shaftesbury, or whether they came to him through the papers which Bolingbroke had prepared for his use, we have no means of determining. On the other hand, Pope had certainly read Shaftesbury's work, for he mentions the character of Theocles in the latter's The Moralists in his Dunciad (IV.487–490): [...] "Or that bright Image to our Fancy draw,/Which Theocles in raptur'd vision saw,/While thro' Poetic scenes the Genius roves,/Or wanders wild in Academic Groves". In his notes to these lines, Pope directs the reader to various passages in Shaftesbury's work.|$|E
