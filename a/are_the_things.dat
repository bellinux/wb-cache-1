For the sake of us two, fight for our love against temptation". The track features Queen and Dominican bachata singer Frank Reyes; she expressed her love for the song (and bachata in general), calling it a genre where [...] "men express themselves with women".

500|$|Eurogamer's Christian Donlan {{considered}} {{that the game}} lacked the same [...] "surprise" [...] as its predecessor, but praised the overall improvement of bosses, animations and the scope of activities available. Donlan said that the game environment was intricate and very detailed, and the abilities provided for its traversal made it [...] "hard not to feel like the world's greatest detective, on patrol". IGN's Greg Miller said [...] "the voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and {{the feeling of being}} the Dark Knight—these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that standout". Miller said that the Catwoman missions were a fun change of pace from the main gameplay, and that he [...] "adored" [...] the option to replay the game with unlocked abilities and more difficult enemies.|$|E

500|$|At first, the {{developers}} {{had no idea}} how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages. Eventually, they created grayscale heightmaps, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design. Rand noted that attention to detail allowed Myst to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating [...] "A lot can be done with texture…Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things.

500|$|Going Commando was {{approved}} for development {{five months before}} the first game's release, after highly positive reviews from the original's playtesters. In August 2002, Insomniac Games started designing the visual concepts for Going Commando, while still fixing bugs in the original game. Brian Hastings, Insomniac's Vice President of Programming, said in a 2003 interview that {{the first step in}} the game's design was to [...] "try to come up with a few 'Big Ideas'. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we think will really grab people's attention and give the game that Wow-Factor. In the case of Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando the big ideas were RPG elements (like weapon upgrades and health upgrades), spherical planets and space combat." [...] Hastings said that the inspiration for the game's spherical worlds came in part from the cover of the 1943 novel The Little Prince. Designing the spherical worlds required changing about 50,000 lines of the game's code, to account for the different handling of gravity. Development took a total of ten months, during which time Insomniac's design team doubled from 40 to 80 members.|$|E
500|$|The Swedish {{director}} Ingmar Bergman {{called his}} own film The Virgin Spring [...] "touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa", and added, [...] "At that time my {{admiration for the}} Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!" [...] In Italy, Federico Fellini in an interview declared the director [...] "the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be"—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, Seven Samurai. In France, Roman Polanski in 1965 cited Kurosawa {{as one of his}} three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and Orson Welles), singling out Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: [...] "Kurosawa's movies and La Dolce Vita of Fellini <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director." [...] German New Wave director Werner Herzog has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: [...] "Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship, Griffith... Buñuel, Kurosawa and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible, all come to mind." [...] When asked to list his favorite directors, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named Seven Samurai as one of his ten favorite films.|$|E

[...] Moralde further {{explained}} that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as [...] "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. [...] "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that are beautiful," [...] he concluded. Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a [...] "Madonna rip-off", while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga {{has found a way to}} place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E
2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I can do for you. Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.'

2500|$|While at film school, Hertzfeldt {{was drawn}} to {{animation}} {{as it was a}} less expensive form to work in.

Editing, writing, sound—those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that usually come first in my head. Animation is often just the busy work I need to get through to connect the dots and tell the story." ...|$|E

He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you." [...] (Agawa, n.d.).
