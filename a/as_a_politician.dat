5|$|Smith's {{injuries}} {{also made}} him permanently unable {{to sit for}} long periods without pain, so when he attended conferences <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> he would briefly rise from his seat from time to time. During his talks with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson aboard HMS Tiger in 1966, Smith regularly got up and looked out of a porthole; the British incorrectly interpreted this as Smith feeling intimidated by Wilson, or seasick.|$|E

5|$|Harding, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> {{respected}} by both Republicans and Progressives, {{was asked to}} be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address. He urged delegates to stand as a united party. The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the November 1916 presidential election, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.|$|E

At Williams, he participated in the debating society and {{for a short time}} was the editor of a student newspaper. In the autumn of 1832, Yancey took his first steps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> by working on the campaign for Whig Ebenezer Emmons. Overall, Yancey had a successful stay at Williams academically that was marred only by frequent disciplinary problems. Despite being selected as the Senior Orator by his class, Yancey left the school in the spring of 1833, six weeks before graduation.|$|E

During the Argentine civil war he fought against Facundo several times, and while in Spain he {{became a member of}} the Literary Society of Professors. Exiled to Chile by Rosas when he started to write Facundo, Sarmiento would later return <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician.</b> He was a member of the Senate after Rosas's fall and president of Argentina for six years (18681874). During his presidency, Sarmiento concentrated on migration, sciences, and culture. His ideas were based on European civilization; for him, the development of a country was rooted in education. To this end, he founded Argentina's military and naval colleges.|$|E

5|$|Gil {{started to}} play music {{as a child and}} was still a {{teenager}} when he joined his first band. He {{began his career as a}} bossa nova musician, and then grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the Música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> and environmental advocate.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, the Indian National Congress {{was elected}} to power in the Presidency of Madras for the first time. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was the first Chief Minister of the Presidency {{to come from the}} Congress party. He {{successfully}} enacted the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act and introduced both prohibition and sales taxes in the Madras Presidency. His rule is largely remembered for the use of Hindi being made compulsory in educational institutions, a measure which made him highly unpopular <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> and sparked widespread Anti-Hindi agitations, which led to violence in some places. Over 1,200 men, women, and children were jailed for their participation in such Anti-Hindi agitations while Thalamuthu and Natarasan died during the protests. In 1940, Congressional ministers resigned in protest over the Government of India's declaration of war on Germany without their consent. The Governor of Madras, Sir Arthur Hope, took over the administration and the unpopular law was eventually repealed by him on 21 February 1940.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> {{he served as}} a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, {{although}} he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.|$|E

After completing his studies at Rhodes, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for his birthplace, Selukwe, in 1948. He became Prime Minister in 1964, during his country's dispute with Britain regarding the terms for independence; Smith was influenced <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> by his wartime experiences, and Rhodesia's military record on behalf of Britain became central to his sense of betrayal by post-war British governments. This partly motivated his administration's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. His status as a Second World War RAF veteran helped him win support, both domestically and internationally.|$|E
