5|$|Though Kikai {{started to}} {{photograph}} in Asakusa {{simply because it}} was near where he then lived, he has continued {{because of the nature}} of the place and its visitors. Once a bustling and fashionable area, Asakusa long ago lost this status. If it were as popular and crowded <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the war, Kikai says, he would go somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E
5|$|The euro is the second-most {{widely held}} reserve {{currency}} after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate {{against the other}} major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With {{the advent of the}} global financial crisis the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable. In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index– measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the crisis kicked off in 2007. In late August 2017 € rose again above 1.20 $.It also hit new relative or absolute highs against £ and other currencies.|$|E

25|$|As {{the capital}} city of the Spanish Empire from 1561, Madrid's {{population}} grew rapidly.

25|$|Each charm {{is divided}} into two parts: a {{preamble}} telling the story of a mythological event; and the actual spell {{in the form of a}} magic analogy (just <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before...</b> so shall it also be now...).

25|$|In 1847, the Mineral Point Tribune {{reported}} that the town's furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900kg) of lead each day. Lead mining in southwest Wisconsin began to decline after 1848 and 1849 when the combination of less easily accessible lead ore and the California Gold Rush made miners leave the area. The lead mining industry in mining communities such as Mineral Point managed to survive into the 1860s, but the industry was never as prosperous <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the decline.|$|E

Along and parallel to the Tennessee–Arkansas state line, the former course of the Mississippi River <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes is still visible in the landscape almost 200 years after the events. The former riverbed has shrunk to small side arms of the Mississippi River which, dependent on the water level and precipitation, are still partly connected to the river.|$|E

25|$|Other churches {{include the}} Georgian Holy Trinity Church (now {{converted}} to office use) {{and the late}} neo-Gothic (1911) St. Paul's, King Cross, by Sir Charles Nicholson. St Paul's is notable {{not only for its}} fine acoustics but also for an unusual and highly colourful west window, specified by Nicholson, showing the apocalyptic vision of the Holy City descending upon the smoky mills and railway viaducts of Halifax <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the First World War. The Church of St Jude in Savile Park, designed by local architect William Swinden Barber in 1888, is easily identified by the four large pinnacles on its tower.|$|E
25|$|Yup'ik masks (kegginaquq and nepcetaq in Yup'ik, agayu in Cup'ig) are {{expressive}} shamanic ritual masks. One {{of their}} most popular forms of the Alaska Native art are masks. The masks vary enormously but are characterised by great invention. They are typically made of wood, and painted with few colors. The Yup'ik masks were carved by men or women, but mainly were carved by the men. They most often create masks for ceremonies but the masks are traditionally destroyed after being used. After Christian contact in the late 19th century, masked dancing was suppressed, and today it is not practiced <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> in the Yup'ik villages.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, The Leys grew {{significantly}} and by 1930 {{the number of}} pupils had reached 271. During World War Two, the school temporarily moved to the Atholl Palace Hotel in Pitlochry, Scotland, returning to Cambridge in 1946. During the Cold War, the school was designated the auxiliary headquarters to the Regional Seat of Government for Cambridge in time of war. Today {{the majority of the}} pupils are boarders and since the admission of girls to the Sixth Form in the 1980s, the school has become fully co-educational. It now accepts pupils from the age of eleven, rather than the age of thirteen <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

All the publicity surrounding the calendar has taken a toll on their personal lives, and they lash out {{at each other in}} angry frustration. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the Mother Teresa-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> they removed their clothing.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} the {{computing}} model changed, and Unix's treatment of everything as a file or byte stream no longer was as universally applicable <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before.</b> Although a terminal could {{be treated as a}} file or a byte stream, which is printed to or read from, the same {{did not seem to be}} true for a graphical user interface. Networking posed another problem. Even if network communication can be compared to file access, the low-level packet-oriented architecture dealt with discrete chunks of data and not with whole files. As the capability of computers grew, Unix became increasingly cluttered with code. It is also because the modularity of the Unix kernel is extensively scalable. While kernels might have had 100,000 lines of code in the seventies and eighties, kernels of modern Unix successors like Linux have more than 13 million lines.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Dikembe Mutombo {{made people}} {{question}} the draft's legitimacy when he prematurely tweeted a congratulatory {{message to the}} Philadelphia 76ers for receiving the first pick hours before the lottery was conducted. Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick. Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained exactly the same <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the event took place, {{which was the first}} occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive Magic Johnson raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach Luke Walton that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the 2017 NBA draft after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick. As a result of the way teams like the Philadelphia 76ers were manipulating draft odds in their favor by losing games on purpose, starting September 28, 2017 {{with the end of the}} 2018 NBA draft, the NBA would implement a new system discouraging teams from going through Philadelphia's route in the mid-2010's by not only giving the worst three teams equal odds at the #1 pick, but also increasing their odds at going down within the draft with four teams being selected instead of the usual three.|$|E
