5|$|Floating gardens, {{labelled}} the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri {{language are}} a special {{feature of the}} lake. They basically constitute of matted vegetation <b>and</b> <b>earth,</b> but are floating.

5|$|From Pallas, Mercury, Venus, Mars, <b>and</b> <b>Earth</b> can {{occasionally}} {{appear to}} transit, or pass in front of, the Sun.

5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After {{this period}} of time Venus <b>and</b> <b>Earth</b> have {{returned}} to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits.

This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.|$|E

5|$|The Moon <b>and</b> <b>Earth</b> orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Earth,</b> Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The Science Research Complex {{is located}} on the {{northwest}} side of campus. The buildings of the science research complex were built in the mid-60s.

5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, <b>and</b> <b>Earth</b> during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon <b>and</b> <b>Earth</b> is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Earth,</b> and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone <b>and</b> <b>earth</b> mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus <b>and</b> <b>Earth</b> would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E
