25|$|Other {{prominent}} feminists, including Frida Laski, Dora Russell, Joan Malleson and Janet Chance {{began to}} champion this cause - the cause broke dramatically {{into the mainstream}} in July 1932 when the British Medical Association council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on <b>abortion.</b> <b>On</b> 17 February 1936, Janet Chance, Alice Jenkins and Joan Malleson established the Abortion Law Reform Association as the first advocacy organisation for abortion liberalization. The association promoted access to abortion in the United Kingdom and campaigned {{for the elimination of}} legal obstacles.

25|$|Abortion {{is illegal}} in Brazil {{except for the}} case of rape or when the mother's life is in danger. Though abortions are against the law, it is {{estimated}} that over one million abortions are performed in Brazil each year, though data on abortion incidence is not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women are treated for abortion complications each year in Brazilian hospitals. The punishment for a woman performing an <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> herself or consenting to an abortion is one to three years of imprisonment. The punishment for those performing abortions is one to four years of imprisonment, and this number increases by one-third if harm is caused to the women or one-half if the abortion leads to the death of the woman.|$|E

25|$|The {{suggestion}} {{was brought to}} widespread attention by a 1999 academic paper, The Impact of Legalized <b>Abortion</b> <b>on</b> Crime, authored by the economists Steven D. Levitt and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime {{to a reduction in}} individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are African American, impoverished, adolescent, uneducated, and single. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of Roe v. Wade and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before {{the rest of the nation}} experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.|$|E
25|$|Pro-choice campaigners {{highlighted}} at {{the time}} that the lack of legislation clarifying the limited circumstances in which abortion is legal in Ireland contributed to Halapanavar's death. Several rallies and vigils were organised nationwide, calling for the Irish government to legislate in relation to <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> the basis of the X Case Attorney General v. X. Campaigners argued that legislation remained outstanding {{at the time}} of Halappanavar's death despite the European Court of Human Rights having instructed the state to clarify its laws on abortion after finding in A, B and C v Ireland (2010) that the Republic of Ireland had violated the Convention by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which a woman can have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association {{continued}} its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought {{the issue of}} abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act. On the grounds of reducing the amount of disease and death associated with illegal abortion, the Abortion Act allowed for legal <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's physical or mental health, to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped. The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service.|$|E
