5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from <b>aircraft</b> <b>in</b> <b>distress</b> or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Manually exiting an {{aircraft}} and parachuting to safety {{has been widely}} used by aviators (especially military aviators and aircrew), and passengers to escape {{an aircraft}} that could not otherwise land safely. While this method of escape is relatively rare in modern times, it was commonly used in World War I by military aviators, and utilized extensively throughout the air wars of World War II. In modern times, the most common means of escape from an <b>aircraft</b> <b>in</b> <b>distress</b> is via an ejection seat. Said system is usually operated by the pilot, aircrew member, or passenger, by engaging an activation device manually. In most designs, this {{will lead to the}} seat being propelled out of and away from the aircraft carrying the occupant with it, by means of either an explosive charge or a rocket propulsion system. Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection seat will deploy a parachute, although some older models entrusted this step to manual activation by the seat's occupant.|$|E

40|$|The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have jointly {{developed}} a valuable series of polar-orbiting Earth environmental observation satellites since 1978. These satellites provide global data to NOAA's short- and long-range weather forecasting systems. The system {{consists of two}} polar-orbiting satellites known as the Advanced Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS-N) (ATN). Operating as a pair, these satellites ensure that environmental data, for any region of the Earth, {{is no more than}} six hours old. These polar-orbiting satellites have not only provided cost-effective data for very immediate and real needs but also for extensive climate and research programs. The weather data (including images seen on television news programs) has afforded both convenience and safety to viewers throughout the world. The satellites also support the SARSAT (Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking) part of the COSPAS-SARSAT constellation. Russia provides the COSPAS (Russian for Space Systems for the Search of Vessels <b>in</b> <b>Distress)</b> satellites. The international COSPAS-SARSAT system provides for the detection and location of emergency beacons for ships, <b>aircraft,</b> and people <b>in</b> <b>distress</b> and has contributed to the saving of more than 10, 000 lives since its inception in 1982...|$|R
50|$|EPIRBs are {{tracking}} transmitters which aid in {{the detection}} and location of boats, <b>aircraft,</b> and people <b>in</b> <b>distress.</b> A PLB (personal locator beacon) is particular type of EPIRB that is typically smaller, has a shorter battery life and unlike a proper EPIRB is registered to a person rather than a vessel. The terms ELB (emergency locator beacon) and ELT (emergency locator transmitter) are used interchangeably with EPIRB only when used on aircraft. Strictly, they are radiobeacons many of which interface with worldwide offered service of Cospas-Sarsat, the international satellite system for search and rescue (SAR). Transmitters broadcasting on 406 MHz are recognized. When manually activated, or automatically activated upon immersion or impact, such beacons send out a distress signal. The signals are monitored worldwide {{and the location of}} the distress is detected by non-geostationary satellites using the doppler effect for trilateration, and in more recent EPIRBs also by GPS.|$|R
