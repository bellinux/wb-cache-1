While Waten wanted him to admire {{the achievements of the}} Soviet state, Clark was more interested in attending the Bolshoi Ballet, the Dostoyevsky Museum and the St Sergius Monastery at Zagorsk.

Unseen by the crew, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) is hit with a strange energy discharge as the ship passes the cloud, causing him to become violent. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) sedates Worf and brings him to the sickbay, but is also infused with the energy as she examines his body.

500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E

Finn worries that his future prospects will be diminished by fatherhood. He asks glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to coach the football team at dancing, believing it will help them to improve, increasing his chances of securing a football scholarship. Finn confides Quinn's news to his best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who later confronts Quinn, claiming to be the baby's father, since she said she was a virgin when they had sex. Quinn rejects Puck, calling him a [...] "Lima loser" [...] who could never support her and the baby like Finn. Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) reveals to her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) that she experienced a hysterical pregnancy and is not really carrying Will's baby. Kendra suggests that they acquire a baby, and when Terri learns of Quinn's pregnancy from Will, she confronts her, <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> her prenatal care.|$|E

500|$|It {{was clear}} that Lasseter and Jobs {{believed}} that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked {{what they were doing}} next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. [...] "If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars" [...] for computer animation companies, he told various friends. [...] "I should have been wary," [...] Lasseter later recalled. [...] "Jeffrey kept <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> when it would be released." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer David Wolstencroft {{decided that}} Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm, because IT has, {{according}} to Wolstencroft, [...] "something {{that has an}} enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it that nobody would really understand," [...] and according to series producer Jane Featherstone, has people reluctant to be <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about.</b> A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that [...] "children are the best spies of all"; Maisie is often seen [...] "spying" [...] on Tom throughout the episode and first series. Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Madonna had {{focused on a}} number of provocative releases, like the erotic {{pictorial}} Sex book, the sadomasochist inspired album Erotica, and the erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, all of which she deduced was due to [...] "a lot of rage and anger" [...] within herself. However, {{by the beginning of the}} new millennium, Madonna was living a calmer, more introspective and wholesome life with her husband Guy Ritchie and their children Lourdes and Rocco. According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, the presence of Ritchie in Madonna's life had a calming effect on the singer, making her more matured and easing her temper. Concentrating on her music career, Madonna was busy throughout of 2001 on her Drowned World Tour. On September 11, 2001, suicide bombers hijacked two jet airliners and crashed into the World Trade Center, resulting in the death of nearly 3,000people. The event had a profound effect on American society, with the cultural mood being bleakness and paranoia. People, including Madonna, started <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> their culture and the American Dream, which had been a long-lasting ideal for many. When Madonna started working on her ninth studio album, American Life, she wanted answers to her queries and an appropriate response to the 9/11 disaster and the ensuing Iraq war of 2003. She believed that the ensuing months with the war would lead to a politically charged atmosphere throughout the country, and wanted to express that in the record.|$|E
