40|$|Introduction. The {{determination}} of ethyl glucuronide (EtG), {{a stable and}} sensitive marker that is specific to alcohol intake, finds many applications both in the forensic toxicology and clinical fields. Aim. The aim {{of the study is}} to examine the possibility of using a cadaveric biological matrix, vitreous humor (VH), to determine EtG as a marker of recent ethanol use. Methods. The blood, taken from the femoral vein, and the VH were obtained from 63 autopsy cases. Analysis of the EtG was performed using an LC/MS/MS system. Analyses of the ethanol and putrefaction biomarkers, such as acetaldehyde and n-propanol, were performed using the HS-GC/FID technique in both the matrices. Results. In 17 cases, both ethanol and EtG were absent in both matrices. Nineteen cases presented ethanol in blood from 0. 05 to 0. 30 g/L, EtG-Blood concentration from 0. 02 to 3. 27 mg/L, and EtG-VH concentration from 0. 01 mg/L to 2. 88 mg/L. Thirteen cases presented ethanol in blood > 0. 05 g/L but EtG concentration in blood and VH lower than 0. 01 mg/L, are part of these 8 samples presented <b>acetic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> and n- propanol in blood or VH, means identification of putrefaction indicators. Fourteen cases presented ethanol in blood > 0. 46 and EtG concentration in blood and VH higher than 0. 01 mg/L. Conclusions. The {{determination of}} EtG in biological material is important in those cases where the intake of ethanol appears doubtful, as it allows us to exclude the possibility of any post-mortem formation of ethanol...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{study of}} three methods for {{the determination of}} lactic acid (EDWARDS, MENDEL & GOLDSCHEIDER, MILLER & MUNTZ) is presented and some modifications are proposed. It was shown t hat more accurate results could be obtained with Edward's technic when an Iena glass filter is connected with the absorption tube. Before the dropping of the permanganate solution {{it is necessary to}} pass a current of air through the reaction flask to avoid the oxidation of the non-lactic acid substances which interfere with the reaction. The absorption tube must be maintained at 18 °C during the destillation and the titration of the bisulphite binding aldehyde at 4 °C. When the sample contains more than 5 mg it is useful to work with greater quantities of the bisulphite. More permanganate is consumed when the lactic acid concentration is higher. The sensivity of the method permits the titration of 0. 04 mg to 5 mg of lactic acid in the sample. The calculated error of the method gave 0. 018 % and the normal values for blood determined in 20 human cases averaged 10. 30 mg per 100 ml (Table VI). MENDEL and GOLDSCHEIDER'S method was modified in the following details: Somogyis deproteinization was performed instead metaphosphoric acid as in the original method; to avoid the evaporation of the <b>acetic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> during the heating time with sulfuric acid a special glass stopped tube is proposed (Fig. 2). The reaction with sulfuric acid and veratrol is performed in an ice bath. Blood proteins precipitants were tried and Somogyi's lattest tecnic showed better results (Table V). Colorimetric readings were done in the PULFRICH photometer using filter S 53 and a 10 mm cup. The method is accurate within an error of 0. 23 % and samples of 5 to 70 microg. could be easily determined. Normal values for human blood averaged 10. 78 mg per 100 ml. More accurate results were obtained with the technic of MILLER & MUNTZ. Slight modifications were introduced: deproteinization with copper sulfate and sodium tungstate; satured p-hydroxydiphenyl solution according to KOENEMANN which is stable for 5 months when stored in the ice-box. Using the PULFRICH step-photometer the error is 0. 17 % with samples varying from 0. 1 to 10 microg. of lactic acid. The filter employed was S 57 with the 5 mm cup. The method was adapted to 0. 1 ml of blood. Normal values for human blood gave an average of 10. 58 mg per 100 ml...|$|E

30|$|From the {{analytical}} perspective, {{and given that}} coffee and chocolate come from fermented/roasted natural lignin and cellulose-containing products, they share many VOCs with decaying paper. Cocoa as well as coffee are known to contain significant amounts of furfural and furanoid compounds, <b>acetic</b> acid, higher <b>aldehydes</b> (heptanal, hexanal, octanal), vanillin and benzoic acid [62, 63] and many other compounds identical to those in decaying paper (Table  1). It would therefore appear to be reasonable to expect for museum visitors to associate the aromas of chocolate and coffee with that of historic paper, considering that many identical volatiles in the aroma profiles of the three substances are identical and that in addition, the same visitors were primed to think of chocolate and coffee while visiting the exhibition prior to responding to the questionnaire.|$|R
40|$|After alcohol ingestion, {{the bulk}} of ethanol {{ingested}} (95 %) is rapidly eliminated in the liver in a two-stage oxidation process: first to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehy-drogenase and then to <b>acetic</b> acid by <b>aldehyde</b> dehydro-genase. The remainder is excreted mainly unchanged in urine and expired air. However, another {{small fraction of the}} ingested ethanol dose (0. 1 %) (1) undergoes a phase II conjugation reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase (UGT) to produce ethyl glucuronide (EtG), which is eventually excreted in the urine (2 – 4). Because EtG has a longer period of elimination than the parent compound, the interest in EtG has largely focused on its use as a sensitive and specific biomarker of recent alcohol intake with clinical and forensic applications (5, 6).

The spent hydrolysates served as excellent growth media for the Cel 7 B-producing strain, A. niger D 15 [egI], which displayed higher endoglucanase {{activities in the}} spent hydrolysates than in standard medium with a comparable monosaccharide content (e. g., 2, 100 nkat/ml in spent bagasse hydrolysate compared to 480 nkat/ml in standard glucose-based medium). In addition, A. niger D 15 [egI] was also able to consume or convert other lignocellulose-derived compounds, such as <b>acetic</b> acid, furan <b>aldehydes,</b> and phenolic compounds, which are recognized as inhibitors of yeast during ethanolic fermentation.

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass is an {{abundant}} raw material {{that can be}} utilized to produce ethanol {{with the help of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae; a promising alternative to today’s energy sources. Conversion of lignocellulosic material (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) into fermentable sugars including both hexoses and pentoses results in formation of inhibitory compounds such as <b>acetic</b> acid, furan <b>aldehydes</b> and phenolics that are known to inhibit the yeasts’ metabolic processes. The aims of this study were to i) generate S. cerevisiae strains that can readily convert glucose and xylose into ethanol in the presence of inhibitory compounds, and ii) elucidate the underlying genetic changes of importance for the improved properties of the generated strains. For these purposes, a strain of S. cerevisiae containing genes for xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase was used. The strain was subjected to mutagenesis followed by evolutionary engineering (repetitive batch and chemostat cultivation), which resulted in populations with improved ethanol yield, improved xylose conversion rate and increased inhibitor tolerance. The complex combination of different genetic alterations in the evolved populations will now be revealed using a DNA/RNA sequencing approach. The acquired knowledge of proteins and pathways important for efficient lignocellulosic bioethanol production will then hopefully allow directed engineering for further improvement of yeast performance...|$|R

However, no systematic study has been performed so far. In the frame of this study, passive sampling was carried out at ten locations in four libraries and archives. Despite the very variable sampling locations, no major differences were found, although air-filtered repositories {{were found to have}} lower concentrations while a non-ventilated newspaper repository exhibited the highest concentrations of volatile aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, furfural and hexanal). Five employees in one institution were also provided with personal passive samplers to investigate employees' exposure to volatile aldehydes. All values were lower than the presently valid exposure limits. The concentration of volatile <b>aldehydes,</b> <b>acetic</b> acid, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in general was also compared with that of outdoor-generated pollutants. It was evident that inside the repository and particularly inside archival boxes, the concentration of VOCs and acetic acid was much higher than the concentration of outdoor-generated pollutants, which are otherwise more routinely studied in connection with heritage materials. This indicates that further work on the pro-degradative effect of VOCs on heritage materials is necessary and that monitoring of VOCs in heritage institutions should become more widespread...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{rates and}} fluxes of {{biogenic}} components emitted by a Mediterranean Pseudosteppe were {{measured in the}} BEMA test site of Castelporziano during the 1993 and 1994 field campaigns. Enclosure and micrometeorological techniques were used. Although the emission was comprised of isoprene, semi-volatile <b>aldehydes,</b> <b>acetic</b> acid and monoterpenes at trace levels, the most relevant compound in air was isoprene. Basal emission rates for isoprene (normalized at 30 deg C and 1000 myE PAR) as defined by Guenther et al. (1991, J. geophys. Res. 96, 10, 799 - 10, 808) were obtained for this ecosystem by combining experimental observations and predictions based on the Guenther algorithm. It is shown that the Mediterranean Pseudosteppe is a strong isoprene emitter with a basal emission rate of 0. 45 my g m (- 2) s (- 1) during the flowering season. At {{the end of the}} maximum physiologically active season basal emission rate ranged only in 0. 1 - 0. 15 my g m(- 2) s(- 1). A close dependence from light and temperatur e for the isoprene emission is observed. The decline in emission rates seems to be associated with a reduction in photosynthetic activity linked to senescence of the vegetation present in this ecosystem. The results obtained indicate that the Mediterranean Pseudosteppe is an ecosystem characterized by a rapid and strong variability in isoprene emission. It represents a source of isoprene comparable to deciduous forest areas only during the flowering season (from the middle of March to the middle of May) whereas it becomes a minor source during the end of the maximum physiologically active season...|$|R
40|$|The {{success in}} the commercialization of {{lignocellulosic}} bioethanol relies {{on the development of}} microorganisms with efficient hexose and pentose fermentation and tolerance towards inhibitory by-products (<b>acetic</b> acid, furan <b>aldehydes</b> and phenolics) generated during biomass processing. Traditionally, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the preferred microorganism for industrial ethanol production. Many years of research and development have been conducted to develop S. cerevisiae strains suitable for fermenting lignocellulosic-based streams. S. cerevisiae is robust and ferment glucose efficiently, but it has been proved to be difficult to genetically modify for efficient xylose fermentation. In this work, a xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain was subjected to evolutionary engineering, boosting its robustness and xylose fermentation capacity. The evolved strain was able to ferment a non-diluted enzymatic hydrolysate (representing 23 % (w/w) dry matter of steam-exploded wheat straw), reaching ethanol titers higher than 5 % (w/w) after 48 h. Within the first 24 h, glucose and xylose were co-consumed with rates of 3. 1 and 0. 7 g/L h, respectively, and converted to ethanol with yields corresponding to 93 % of the theoretical. In addition, once glucose was depleted, xylose was consumed with a similar rate until reducing 70 % of its initial concentration (36 h after inoculation). Besides investigating the fermentation parameters, the differences in gene expression levels and enzymatic activities of xylose-assimilating pathway were analyzed. These analyses will be the foundation for understanding the improved phenotype and the physiological mechanisms for efficient xylose fermentation, after which potential targets for subsequent metabolic engineering may be identified...|$|R

40|$|Dwindling oil {{reserves}} {{and the negative}} impacts of fossil fuels on the environment call for more sustainable energy sources. First-generation bioethanol produced from sugar cane and corn has met some of these needs, but it competes with the food supply for raw materials. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant non-edible raw material that {{can be converted to}} ethanol using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, due to the inherent recalcitrance to degradation of lignocellulosic raw materials, harsh pretreatment methods must be used to liberate fermentable sugars, resulting in the release of compounds such as <b>acetic</b> acid, furan <b>aldehydes</b> and phenolics, that inhibit yeast metabolism. This thesis research aimed to identify bottlenecks in terms of inhibitory compounds related to ethanol production from two lignocellulosic raw materials, Arundo donax and spruce, and furthermore to harness the physiological responses to these inhibitors to engineer more robust yeast strains. A comparative study of separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) revealed that acetic acid limits xylose utilization in pretreated Arundo donax, whereas the furan aldehydes furfural and 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde (HMF) were hypothesized to be key inhibitors in pretreated spruce. The impacts of furfural and HMF on the redox and energy metabolism of S. cerevisiae were studied in detail in chemostat and batch cultivations. After adding the inhibitors to the feed medium of chemostat cultivations, the intracellular levels of NADH, NADPH, and ATP were found to decrease by 40, 75, and 19 %, respectively, suggesting that furan aldehydes drain the cells of reducing power. A strong effect on redox metabolism was also observed after pulsing furfural and HMF in the xylose consumption phase in batch cultures. The drainage of reducing power was also observed in a genome-wide study of transcription that found that genes related to NADPH-requiring processes, such as nitrogen and sulphur assimilation, were significantly induced. The redox metabolism was engineered by overproducing the protective metabolite and antioxidant glutathione. Strains with an increased intracellular level of reduced glutathione were found to sustain ethanol production for longer duration in SSF of pretreated spruce, yielding 70 % more ethanol than did the wild type strain...|$|R
