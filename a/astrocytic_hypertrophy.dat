40|$|Abstract Background The {{pathogenesis}} of HIV- 1 {{glycoprotein 120}} (gp 120) associated neuroglial toxicity remains unresolved, but oxidative injury {{has been widely}} implicated as a contributing factor. In previous studies, exposure of primary human central nervous system tissue cultures to gp 120 led to a simplification of neuronal dendritic elements as well as <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and hyperplasia; neuropathological features of HIV- 1 -associated dementia. Gp 120 and proinflammatory cytokines upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), {{an important source of}} nitric oxide (NO) and nitrosative stress. Because ascorbate scavenges reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, we studied the effect of ascorbate supplementation on iNOS expression as well as the neuronal and glial structural changes associated with gp 120 exposure. Methods Human CNS cultures were derived from 16 – 18 week gestation post-mortem fetal brain. Cultures were incubated with 400 μM ascorbate- 2 -O-phosphate (Asc-p) or vehicle for 18 hours then exposed to 1 nM gp 120 for 24 hours. The expression of iNOS and neuronal (MAP 2) and astrocytic (GFAP) structural proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). Results Following gp 120 exposure iNOS was markedly upregulated from undetectable levels at baseline. Double label CSLM studies revealed astrocytes to be the prime source of iNOS with rare neurons expressing iNOS. This upregulation was attenuated by the preincubation with Asc-p, which raised the intracellular concentration of ascorbate. <b>Astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and neuronal injury caused by gp 120 were also prevented by preincubation with ascorbate. Conclusions Ascorbate supplementation prevents the deleterious upregulation of iNOS and associated neuronal and astrocytic protein expression and structural changes caused by gp 120 in human brain cell cultures. </p...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is {{a hallmark of}} gliosis, the <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> that occurs during {{a wide variety of}} diseases of the central nervous system. To determine whether this increase in GFAP expression per se alters astrocyte function, we generated transgenic mice that carry copies of the human GFAP gene driven by its own promoter. Astrocytes of these mice are hypertrophic, up-regulate small heat-shock proteins, and contain inclusion bodies identical histologically and antigenically to the Rosenthal fibers of Alexander's disease. Mice in the highest expressing lines die by the second postnatal week. The results support the notion that Alexander's disease is a disorder of astrocytes, and provide an animal model for studying the causes and consequences of inclusion body disease...|$|E
40|$|<b>Astrocytic</b> {{proliferation}} and <b>hypertrophy</b> (astrogliosis) {{are associated with}} neuronal injury. However, neither the temporal nor the spatial relationship between astrocytes and injured neurons is clear, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated these questions in a mouse amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model. The initial increase in astrogliosis coincided {{with the onset of}} clinical disease and massive mitochondrial vacuolation in motor neurons. After disease onset, astrogliosis increased further in parallel with the number of degenerating motor neurons. Examination of individual astrocytes by three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that astrocytes extended their processes toward, wrapped around, and sometimes penetrated vacuoles derived from neuronal mitochondria. These results show a close temporal correlation between the onset of neuronal degeneration and the beginning of astrogliosis in this neurodegenerative disease and reveal a novel spatial relationship that is consistent with the view that astrocytes play {{an active role in the}} neuronal degeneration process...|$|R
40|$|Rhesus, patas and vervet monkeys were {{infected}} i. c. or i. n. with three viruses of the tick-borne encephalitis complex (TBE) as follows: Turkish tick-borne encephalitis virus (TTE), Louping-ill virus and Central European tick-borne encephalitis virus (CETE). The incidence of overt clinical signs of disease varied {{according to the}} virus that {{was used for the}} inoculations. TTE proved to be more pathogenic for monkeys than the other two members of the complex, whilst CETE was the least pathogenic. Injections of specific antiserum soon after infection tended to increase both the incidence of clinical signs and the moratlity. A proportion of animals with inapparent infections and a number of monkeys that recovered from the acute phase of the disease developed degenerative lesions in the cerebellum, often superimposed on the involuting inflammatory changes. The changes affected either a few only or many folia of the cerebellum and consisted of neuronal and spongy degeneration of the Purkinje and granular layers, usually accompanied by marked <b>astrocytic</b> proliferation and <b>hypertrophy</b> in the granular and molecular layers...|$|R

Three diffusion parameters [...] -ECS volume fraction a (a 5 ECS volume/ total tissue volume), tortuosity l (l 2 5 D/ADC; where D is {{the free and}} ADC is the apparent diffusion coefficient of TMA 1 in the brain), and nonspecific TMA 1 uptake k 8 [...] -were determined at 3, 7, 21, and 35 days postwounding (dpw), in the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion. Following diffusion experiments, tissue sections were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycans (CSPG). In the area 300 [...] 1000 m around the wound, a was increased at 3, 7, and 21 dpw by about 20 % but returned to control values at 35 dpw; l was increased at all four intervals, reaching a maximum at 7 dpw. k 8 was lower than in the contralateral hemisphere at 7, 21, and 35 dpw. Measurements 1, 500 [...] 2, 000 m from the wound revealed only an increase in l at 7 dpw. The time course of changes in ECS diffusion parameters closely correlated with increased staining for GFAP and CSPG. Our results show that astrogliosis significantly changes the diffusion properties of nervous tissue, making it less permissive.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{pathogenesis}} of central nervous system abnormalities in Down syndrome (DS), we have analyzed a new genetic model of DS, the partial trisomy 16 (Ts 65 Dn) mouse. Ts 65 Dn mice have an extra copy of the distal aspect of mouse chromosome 16, a segment homologous to human chromosome 21 that contains much of the genetic material responsible for the DS phenotype. Ts 65 Dn mice show developmental delay during the postnatal period as well as abnormal behaviors in both young and adult animals that may be analogous to mental retardation. Though the Ts 65 Dn brain is normal on gross examination, there is age-related degeneration of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons and <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> markers of the Alzheimer disease pathology that is present in elderly DS individuals.

40|$|Olfactory mucosa is {{a source}} of cells for transplant-mediated repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) and is {{currently}} being assessed in clinical trials. We previously reported that olfactory mucosa can generate two types of sphere-forming cells with stem cell-like properties. Here we have assessed the repair potential of these cells in a rodent SCI model. Sphere-forming cells transplanted into a dorsal column injury integrated with the host spinal cord, filling the injury cavity, but showed no evidence of differentiation in vivo. Moreover, transplants supported robust axonal regeneration, particularly when suspensions of smaller spheres, rather than large aggregates, were transplanted. However, tract-tracing of dorsal column fibers showed that regenerating axons did not extend beyond the transplant. These observations show that undifferentiated olfactory spheres, though capable of supporting axonal regeneration, do not show any advantage over olfactory ensheathing cells isolated from adult olfactory tissue. In addition, olfactory spheres induced a greater <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> at the injury site than previously observed for purified olfactory ensheathing cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mouse brains, cell {{cultures}} of mouse brains, and spleens from mice with scrapie were examined by electron microscopy. Brains and spleens of 10 scrapie-inoculated and control mice were studied. Seven brain-cell cultures, four {{of which were}} from mice inoculated intracerebrally or subcutaneously with scrapie, were examined.

40|$|Abstract. Hypoxic/ischemic {{encephalopathy}} in a cloned American Quarter horse foal {{was initially}} associated with placental insufficiency and exacerbated by protracted hypotension during anesthesia for a surgical procedure. The foal, {{born at the}} Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Center, was diagnosed at birth with neonatal maladjustment syndrome that was accompanied by dysmaturity, muscle contracture of the front limbs, and a blood clot within the lumen of the urinary bladder. Seizures that developed after anesthesia were attributed to hypoxia/ischemia during anesthesia and culminated in death. Macroscopically, the cerebrum had flattened cerebral gyri with shallow sulci, yellowish cortical discoloration, and apple-green autofluorescence (under 365 -nm ultraviolet light) at the cortical/white matter junction. Microscopically, there was laminar cortical necrosis with prominent diffuse ischemic change of neuronal cell bodies. The white matter had prominent rarefaction with focal axonal and myelin degeneration and focal macrophage (gitter cell) accumulation. Additionally, there was <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> with gemistocyte formation. The chorioallantois was diffusely thickened in the area corresponding to the uterine horns.

40|$|Up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines {{in brain}} ("neuroinflammation") accompanies {{neurological}} disease and neurotoxicity. Previously, we documented a striatal neuroinflammatory response to acute administration of a neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine (METH), i. e. one associated {{with evidence of}} dopaminergic terminal damage and activation of microglia and astroglia. When we used minocycline to suppress METH-induced neuroinflammation, indices of dopaminergic neurotoxicity were not affected, but suppression of neuroinflammation was incomplete. Here, we administered the classic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), {{in an attempt to}} completely suppress METH-related neuroinflammation. METH alone caused large increases in striatal proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine mRNA and subsequent <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> microglial activation, and dopaminergic nerve terminal damage. Pre-treatment of mice with acute CORT failed to prevent neuroinflammatory responses to METH. Surprisingly, when mice were pre-treated with chronic CORT in the drinking water, an enhanced striatal neuroinflammatory response to METH was observed, an effect that was accompanied by enhanced METH-induced astrogliosis and dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Chronic CORT pre-treatment also sensitized frontal cortex and hippocampus to mount a neuroinflammatory response to METH. Because the levels of chronic CORT used are associated with high physiological stress, our data suggest that chronic CORT therapy or sustained physiological stress may sensitize the neuroinflammatory and neurotoxicity responses to METH.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} ion concentration on the enzyme activity of astrocytes {{was investigated in}} tissue cultures of rat cerebral cortex. It {{was found that the}} oxidative enzymatic activity (succinic dehydrogenase, DPN-diaphorase, and several other enzymes) of astrocytes depended on the concentration of NaCl in the environment. This response was not specific for NaCl, but was also elicited by MgC 12 and LiCI; the response was less consistent, and often questionable for KCI. However, only NaC 1 could elicit enzymatic changes in astrocytes at concentrations known to be present in a living organism. Astrocytes were the only cells which responded this way; it appeared that the foot-plates were particularly involved in the response since increase of enzyme activity occurred earlier in the foot-plates than in the perikarya. It was concluded that astrocytes are metabolically involved in the maintenance of the ionic and osmotic environment of the central nervous system, particularly in regard to the active transport of sodium. <b>Astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and its extreme stage of swollen or gemistocytic astrocytes {{is one of the most}} universally observed cellular reactions in pathological nervous tissue.

40|$|In {{addition}} to neuronal vacuolation and <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> dendritic atrophy is a prominent feature of prion disease. Because increased Notch- 1 expression and cleavage releasing its intracellular domain (NICD) inhibit both dendrite growth and maturation, we measured their levels in brains from mice inoculated with Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) prions. The level of NICD was elevated in the neocortex, whereas {{the level of}} β-catenin, which stimulates dendritic growth, was unchanged. During the incubation period, levels of the disease-causing prion protein isoform, PrPSc, and NICD increased concomitantly in the neocortex. Additionally, increased levels of Notch- 1 mRNA and translocation of NICD to the nucleus correlated well with regressive dendritic changes. In scrapie-infected neuroblastoma (ScN 2 a) cells, the level of NICD was elevated compared with uninfected control (N 2 a) cells. Long neurofilament protein-containing processes extended {{from the surface of}} N 2 a cells, whereas ScN 2 a cells had substantially shorter processes. Transfection of ScN 2 a cells with a Notch- 1 small interfering RNA decreased Notch- 1 mRNA levels, diminished NICD concentrations, and rescued the long process phenotype. These results suggest that PrPSc in neurons and in ScN 2 a cells activates Notch- 1 cleavage, resulting in atrophy of dendrites in the CNS and shrinkage of processes on the surface of cultured cells. Whether diminishing Notch- 1 activation in vivo can prevent or even reverse neurodegeneration in prion disease remains to be established...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory {{processes}} {{have been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of brain damage after stroke. In rodent stroke models, focal ischemia induces several proinflammatory chemokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1). The individual contribution to ischemic tissue damage, however, is largely unknown. To address this question, the authors subjected MCP- 1 -deficient mice (MCP- 1 -/-) to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Measurement of basal blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, and blood volume revealed no differences between wild-type (wt) and MCP- 1 -/- mice. MCAO led to similar cerebral perfusion deficits in wt and MCP- 1 -/- mice, excluding differences in the MCA supply territory and collaterals. However, compared with wt mice, the mean infarct volume was 29 % smaller in MCP- 1 -/- mice 24 hours after MCAO (P = 0. 022). Immunostaining showed a reduction of phagocytic macrophage accumulation within infarcts and the infarct border in MCP- 1 -/- mice 2 weeks after MCAO. At the same time point, the authors found an attenuation of <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> in the infarct border and thalamus in MCP- 1 -/- mice. However, these effects on macrophages and astrocytes in MCP- 1 -/- mice occurred too late to suggest a protective role in acute infarct growth. Of note: at 6 hours after MCAO, MCP- 1 -/- mice produced significantly less interleukin- 1 beta in ischemic tissue; this {{might be related to}} tissue protection. The results {{of this study indicate that}} inhibition of MCP- 1 signaling could be a new acute treatment approach to limit infarct size after stroke...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{transplantation}} is {{one strategy}} for encouraging regeneration after {{spinal cord injury}} {{and a range of}} cell types have been investigated for their repair potential. However, variations in study design complicate determination of which cells are most effective. In this study we have carried out a direct comparison of the regenerative and integrative properties of several cell preparations following transplantation into the lesioned rat spinal cord. Transplants included: (i) purified olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and (ii) fibroblast-like cells, from olfactory bulb (OBFB-L), (iii) a 50 : 50 mixture of (i) and (ii) (OEC/OBFB-L), (iv) dissociated nasal mucosa (OM), (v) purified peripheral nerve Schwann cells (SCs), (vi) peripheral nerve fibroblasts, and (vii) skin fibroblasts (SF). All transplants supported axonal regeneration: OECs and SCs promoted the greatest regeneration while OBFB-like cells were least efficient and mixed cell populations were less effective than purified populations. Tract-tracing experiments demonstrated that none of the cell types promoted regeneration beyond the lesion. Although all cell types prevented cavity formation, the extent of <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> [GFAP immunoreactivity (IR) at the transplant/lesion site] differed markedly. OECs and SCs were associated with the least GFAP-IR, fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cells resulted in greater GFAP-IR while hypertrophy surrounding transplants of OM was most extensive. These differences in host-transplant reactivity were confirmed by transplanting cells into normal spinal cord where the cellular interaction is not complicated by injury. Thus, purified glial cells have advantages for transplant-mediated repair, combining maximal support for axonal regeneration with a minimal astrocytic reaction around the transplant site...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of immune system cells to {{the propagation of}} transmissible encephalopathies is not well understood. To determine how follicular dendritic cells (FDC) may act, we challenged lymphotoxin β null and wild-type (wt) controls with a Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. There was only a small difference in incubation time to clinical disease even after peripheral challenge with low infectious doses (31 {{in a total of}} 410 days). Brain pathology with extensive microglial infiltration, identified by keratan sulfate, as well as <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> was also equivalent in all groups despite the fact that null mice had neither FDC nor splenic metallophilic macrophages that filter particulate antigen. Because FDC accumulate pathologic prion protein (PrP) in infected but not wt mice, we studied the cellular distribution of PrP by confocal microscopy. The majority of pathologic PrP collected on the plasma membrane of FDC, as identified by the Ca+ 2 -binding protein S 100 A. This surface distribution suggested that agent aggregated with pathologic PrP might spread by cell-to-cell contacts. While several types of leukocytes may be involved in agent dissemination, cells of myeloid lineage were found to be infectious. Moreover, perivascular tracks of microglia and abnormal PrP after intraperitoneal inoculation were consistent with hematogenous spread. In summary, FDC are not required for CJD agent spread from the periphery, although FDC may enhance spread through surface accumulation of pathologic PrP. While it is still not clear where the infectious agent replicates, macrophages can sequester appreciable levels of infectivity and hence act as reservoirs for prolonged latent infection...|$|E
40|$|Astrogliosis, a {{cellular}} response characterized by <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and accumulation of GFAP, is {{a hallmark of}} all types of central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Potential signaling mechanisms driving the conversion of astrocytes into "reactive" phenotypes differ with respect to the injury models employed and can be complicated by factors such as disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). As denervation tools, neurotoxicants have the advantage of selective targeting of brain regions and cell types, often with sparing of the BBB. Previously, we found that neuroinflammation and activation of the JAK 2 -STAT 3 pathway in astrocytes precedes up regulation of GFAP in the MPTP mouse model of dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Here we show that multiple mechanistically distinct mouse models of neurotoxicity (MPTP, AMP, METH, MDA, MDMA, KA, TMT) engender the same neuroinflammatory and STAT 3 activation responses in specific regions of the brain targeted by each neurotoxicant. The STAT 3 effects seen for TMT in the mouse could be generalized to the rat, demonstrating cross-species validity for STAT 3 activation. Pharmacological antagonists of the neurotoxic effects blocked neuroinflammatory responses, pSTAT 3 tyr 705 and GFAP induction, indicating that damage to neuronal targets instigated astrogliosis. Selective deletion of STAT 3 from astrocytes in STAT 3 conditional knockout mice markedly attenuated MPTP-induced astrogliosis. Monitoring STAT 3 translocation in GFAP-positive cells indicated that effects of MPTP, METH and KA on pSTAT 3 tyr 705 were localized to astrocytes. These findings strongly implicate the STAT 3 pathway in astrocytes as a broadly triggered signaling pathway for astrogliosis. We also observed, however, that the acute neuroinflammatory response to the known inflammogen, LPS, can activate STAT 3 in CNS tissue without inducing classical signs of astrogliosis. Thus, acute phase neuroinflammatory responses and neurotoxicity-induced astrogliosis both signal through STAT 3 but appear to do so through different modules, perhaps localized to different cell types...|$|E

We measured light transmittance, ECS volume fraction (#), and extracellular K in rat spinal cord slices during electrical stimulation and the application of elevated potassium, NMDA, or anisoosmotic solutions. Dorsal root stimulation (10 Hz/ 1 min) induced an elevation in extracellular K to 6 [...] 8 mM, a light transmittance increase of 6 [...] 8 %, and a relative ECS volume decrease of less than 5 %; all of these changes had different time courses. The application of 6 or 10 mM K or NMDA (10 M) had no measurable effect on #, but light transmittance increased by 20 [...] 25 %. The application of 50 or 80 mM K evoked a 72 % decrease in # while the light transmittance increase remained as large as that in 6 or 10 mMK. While the change in # persisted throughout the 45 -min application, light transmittance, after peaking in 6 [...] 8 min, quickly returned to control levels and decreased below them. <b>Astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> was observed in 6, 10, and 50 mM K. The same results followed the application of 10 M NMDA or hypotonic solution (160 mmol/kg). The elevation of extracellular K after NMDA application, corresponding to increased neuronal activity, had a similar time course as the light transmittance changes. Furosemide, Cl -free, or Ca -free solution blocked or slowed down the decreases in #, while the light transmittance increases were unaffected. In hypertonic solution (400 mmol/kg), # increased by 30 [...] 40 %, while light transmittance decreased by 15 [...] 20 %. Thus, light transmittance changes do not correlate with changes in ECS volume but are associated with neuronal activity and morphological changes in astrocytes...|$|E
40|$|Scrapie and {{transmissible}} mink encephalopathy {{were studied}} in hamsters; clinical signs, pathology, and the replication {{of the agents}} of each disease in brain and spleen were compared. The most noticeable clinical sign in scrapie-affected ham-sters was a distinct cerebellar ataxia beginning 16 weeks after inoculation. Ataxia was not prominent in animals affected with transmissible mink encephalopathy; these animals gradually {{became more and more}} lethargic. The pathology in the central nervous system in both diseases consisted of <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> micro-vacuolation of the neuropil, and neuronal degeneration. The scrapie agent ap-peared to have a greater effect on nuclear masses, especially those present in brain stem and the central white matter of the cerebellum. The earliest lesions in both diseases were detected near pia arachnoid surfaces and adjacent to the ven-tricular system. These initial sites of involvement suggest that the cerebrospinal fluid may be an important route by which inocula are disseminated to susceptible cells after intracerebral inoculation. Both agents multiplied rapidly in brain, reach-ing titers> 108 LD 50 /O. 05 ml before the onset of clinical signs. Titers in spleen were 4 - 6 logs lower than titers in brain at every point measured during the asymptomatic or clinical course of disease. Scrapie and transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) are both classified as subacute spongi-form encephalopathies, a group which also in-cludes two human diseases, kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

40|$|An {{excessive}} glutamate level {{can result}} in excitotoxic damage and death of central nervous system (CNS) cells, and {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of many CNS diseases. It may also be related to a failure of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). This study was aimed at examining the effects of extended administration of monosodium glutamate on the BSCB and spinal cord cells in adult male Wistar rats. The glutamate was delivered by subarachnoidal application of glutamate-carrying electrospun nanofiber mat dressing at the lumbar enlargement level. Half of the rats with the glutamate-loaded mat application were treated systemically with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid. A group of intact rats and a rat group with subarachnoidal application of an ‘empty’ (i. e., carrying no glutamate) nanofiber mat dressing served as controls. All the rats were euthanized three weeks later and lumbar fragments of their spinal cords were harvested for histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. The samples from controls revealed normal parenchyma and BSCB morphology, whereas those from rats with the glutamate-loaded nanofiber mat dressing showed many intraparenchymal microhemorrhages of variable sizes. The capillaries {{in the vicinity of the}} glutamate-carrying dressing (in the meninges and white matter alike) were edematous and leaky, and their endothelial cells showed degenerative changes: extensive swelling, enhanced vacuo­lization and the presence of vascular intraluminal projections. However, endothelial tight junctions were generally well preserved. Some endothelial cells were dying by necrosis or apoptosis. The adjacent parenchyma showed astrogliosis with <b>astrocytic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and swelling of perivascular astrocytic feet. Neurons in the parenchyma revealed multiple symptoms of degeneration, including, inter alia, perikaryal, dendritic and axonal swelling, and destruction of organelles. All the damage symptoms were slightly less severe in the rats given valproic acid treatment, and were absent from both the intact rats and the rats with ‘empty’ nanofiber mat dressing. These results demonstrate that glutamate-loaded nanofiber mat dressing can locally create glutamate levels capable of damaging BSCB and that the resulting damage can be mitigated with concurrent systemic valproate treatment...|$|E
