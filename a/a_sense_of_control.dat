25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E
500|$|The novel's {{title is}} taken from the popular Dominican merengue Mataron al chivo ("They Killed the Goat"), which refers to Trujillo's {{assassination}} on May 30, 1961. Merengue is a style of music created by Ñico Lora in the 1920s and actively promoted by Trujillo himself. It's now considered the country's national music. Cultural critics Julie Sellers and Stephen Ropp comment about this particular merengue that, by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could {{be turned into a}} stew (as frequently happened with goats struck down on the Dominican Republic's highways), the song [...] "gave those performing, listening to, and dancing to this merengue <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades." [...] Vargas Llosa quotes the lyrics to Mataron al chivo {{at the beginning of the}} novel.|$|E
500|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{study by}} Barden-O'Fallon et al., which surveyed 940 women and 661 men, indicated that, despite {{their knowledge and}} awareness, many people in Malawi do not feel personally susceptible to HIV infection. On average, only 23% of the adults who were surveyed during this study, both male and female, {{believed that they were}} likely to contract HIV and die of AIDS. Greater HIV/AIDS awareness among men does not seem to correspond with increased perceived risk; on the other hand, increased levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS do correlate positively to perceived risk among women. Another study conducted in rural Malawi between 1998 and 2001 by Kirsten P. Smith et al. indicated that concerns about personal vulnerability to HIV/AIDS declined during this four-year time frame, probably because the increased use of preventative strategies gave people <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> In fact, many participants in this study claimed that they were [...] "not at all worried" [...] about HIV/AIDS; unless they had simply adopted a fatalistic standpoint towards the epidemic, these respondents probably felt that they had successfully reduced their risk of exposure through personal behavioral changes.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated how regulatory focus might influence trend-reversal predictions. We {{hypothesized that}} compared with promotion focus, prevention focus hinders <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> {{which in turn}} predicts more trend-reversal developments. Studies 1 and 3 revealed that participants expected trend-reversal developments to {{be more likely to}} occur when they focused on prevention than when they focused on promotion. Study 2 extended the findings by including a control condition, and revealed that participants expected trend-reversal developments to be more likely to occur in the prevention condition than in the promotion and control conditions.

500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want to create <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, and we want to have movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding SA {{for both}} motor {{movements}} and thoughts, further distinctions {{may be found}} in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness. For example, while typing I have <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; {{this is an example of}} SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions themselves. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements per se but rather, I am involved with the task at hand. [...] If I'm subsequently asked if I just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious [...] "attribution" [...] of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, pre-reflective [...] "sense" [...] of agency.|$|E

"In five studies, a worsening of symptoms {{during the period of}} follow-up was reported in between 5 and 20% of patients." [...] A good outcome was associated with less fatigue severity at baseline. Other factors were occasionally, but not consistently, related to outcome, including age at onset (5 of 16 studies), and attributing illness to a psychological cause and/or having <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over symptoms (4 of 16 studies). Another review found that children have a better prognosis than adults, with 54–94% having recovered by follow-up compared to less than 10% of adults returning to pre-illness levels of functioning.|$|E

40|$|This {{prospective}} study examines {{the cognitive and}} behavioural mediators {{of the relation between}} personal control and the initial response to a breast cancer diagnosis as well as subsequent psychological adjustment. A total of 143 patients participated immediately after diagnosis (T 1), after surgery (T 2) and 2 months after the end of treatment (T 3), of whom 92 also completed a questionnaire pre-diagnosis (T 0). The buffering effect <b>of</b> personal <b>control</b> on psychological distress shortly after diagnosis was mediated by cancer-specific cognitions, i. e. threat appraisal and coping self-efficacy. Moreover, <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>control</b> predicted lower levels of anxiety 2 months after the end of treatment, but was unrelated to distress at T 3. The adaptive effect on anxiety was mediated by threat appraisal and active engagement in social life after surgery, but not by active patient participation or coping self-efficacy. These results confirm and explain the adaptive effect <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Apparently, women with <b>a</b> low <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> appraise cancer and their personal coping skills more negatively, which makes them vulnerable to distress in response to diagnosis. Furthermore, women with <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> might regulate anxiety by remaining engaged in social lif...|$|R
30|$|Self-control is {{considered}} an organized set of attributes involved in the self-regulation of, for example, cognition, emotion, and behavior (Barkley 1997; Logue 1988, 1995).

This <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> can be realized in the human–computer context {{by a series of}} commands (Kandell 1998).

2500|$|For a {{successful}} therapeutic relationship to form, a beneficial co-dependency between the nurse and patient must be established. A derogatory {{view of the}} patient’s role in the clinical setting dilapidates a therapeutic alliance. While patients need psychiatric/mental health nurses to support their recovery, psychiatric/mental health nurses need patients to develop skills and experience. Psychiatric nurses convey themselves as team members or facilitators of the relationship, rather than the leaders. By empowering the patient with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and involvement, psychiatric nurses encourage the patient's independence. Sole control of certain situations should not be embedded in the nurse. Equal interactions are established when psychiatric nurses talk to patients one-on-one. Participating in activities that do not make one person more dominant over the other, such as talking about a mutual interest or getting lunch together strengthen the levels of equality shared between professionals and patients. This can also create the [...] "illusion of choice"; giving the patient options, even if limited or confined within structure.|$|E
