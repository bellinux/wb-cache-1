40|$|Waldmeier in 1947 {{introduced}} a weighting (on {{a scale from}} 1 to 5) of the sunspot count made at Zurich and its <b>auxiliary</b> <b>station</b> Locarno, whereby larger spots were counted more than once. This counting method inflates the relative sunspot number over that which corresponds to the scale set by Wolfer and Brunner. Svalgaard re-counted some 60, 000 sunspots on drawings from the reference station Locarno and determined {{that the number of}} sunspots reported were 'over counted' by 44 % on average, leading to an inflation (measured by a weight factor) in excess of 1. 2 for high solar activity. In a double-blind parallel counting by the Locarno observer Cagnotti, we determined that Svalgaard's count closely matches that of Cagnotti's, allowing us to determine the daily weight factor since 2003 (and sporadically before). We find that a simple empirical equation fits the observed weight factors well, and use that fit to estimate the weight factor for each month back to the introduction of weighting in 1947 and thus to be able to correct for the over-count and to reduce sunspot counting without weighting to the Wolfer method in use from 1893 onwards.

40|$|The North West Selangor Integrated Agriculture Development Agency (NWS-IADA) has {{the most}} {{productive}} agricultural land in Selangor. This is {{partly because of the}} inherent high fertility of the soils, and the moderate variable climate. However, with the increasing global concern about climate impacts, {{there is a need to}} examine the issue and this article presents a study that examined the relative importance of climate influences on the paddy production rate over 28 years (1980 - 2008). Data collection involved compiling and analyzing climate records from MARDI Tg.

Meanwhile, the daily humidity varied between 94 – 96 % (8. 00 AM) and around 70 % (2. 00 PM) while the sunshine hours ranged between 2. 3 to 9. 5 hours. A correlation analysis between the production yield and climatic data at the studied area for the year 2000 – 2008 showed that for precipitation, rainfall is redundant during the main season while during the off season it bears direct effect on the production yield with R 2 value of - 0. 293 and 0. 1715, respectively.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the nuclear weapons {{development}} and of the nuclear test connected with this development belongs to the most serious present political problem. The political effort to reduce the danger following from the nuclear weapons resulted in a Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The lntemational Monitoring System (!MS), built for verification of the keeping up the Treaty, consists offour networks including the seismic network!MS. Seismic network!MS consists of 50 primary stations and of 120 auxi 1 iary stations. The principa 1 role of the primary stations is to detect the events. The auxiliary stations are necessary for the good location of these detected events. The VRAC station is the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>station</b> of the!MS CTBTO. lt provides indispensable data for location ofregional events in centra 1 and southem Europe, which are detected mainly by the primary station GERESS. The data of station VRAC are also very important for good location of events from the southem Asia, from the westem margin of the Pacific plate, from the region ofthe Mid-Atlantic ridge etc. These data are important for complex processing and for reliab 1 e discrimination of records of nuclear explosions which could be carried aut in Asia.

40|$|The {{recently}} signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty provides {{for an international}} network of primary and auxiliary seismic monitoring stations (IMS) to verify its compliance. Calibration is required to confidently use these stations to identify and discriminate between earthquakes, mine-related events and clandestine nuclear explosions, particularly for small to moderate seismic events recorded regionally at only a few stations. Given the lack of regional recordings of underground nuclear tests {{in most of the}} world, we are making use of mining and industrial explosions to test discriminants. For example we use the Multimax compiled dataset of small earthquakes and quarry explosions in Israel to test regional discriminants at local distances with mixed results. Further complicating calibration is the fact that many INK sites have not yet been installed and others have very short operating histories. When IMS data is available, there is often a lack of independent information (ground truth) on the seismic sources. Here we describe a procedure for calibrating stations with limited data and apply it to the IMS <b>auxiliary</b> <b>station</b> MDT in Morocco. Data was initially available for three months in 1990 when MDT was operated as part of MEDNET. An event detector was run over the continuous data and regional events identified and roughly located using S-P time and back azimuth. The procedure uses spatial and temporal clustering to identify ''known'' mine blasts. The spatial clustering is done using the waveform correlation technique of Harris (1991) to find events with similar sources and locations. Temporal clustering looks at the time of day and repetition in time of events with the mine blasts occurring during working hours and days repeatedly over a period of time. A set of ''known'' earthquakes is also determined using location, time of day, distribution in time and size criteria. With these independent libraries of identified seismic events, we evaluate promising regional discriminants such as high frequency P/Lg. We also examine distance and path effects on the discriminants. Preliminary results indicate high frequency P/Lg provides some separation between mine blasts and earthquakes at MDT...|$|E
40|$|The sudden {{collapse}} of man-made underground cavities have generated seismic signals {{as large as}} magnitude 5. 4. Collapses are {{just one of the}} many types of mining associated seismicity including coalbumps and rockbursts which need to be identified and distinguished from potential clandestine nuclear explosions under the recently signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Collapses, coalbumps and rockbursts are of concern for seismically monitoring a CTBT for a number of reasons. First, they can look like explosions when using some seismic discriminant measures, such M{sub s}:m{sub b}, M{sub o}: m{sub b}, regional P/S ratios and depth. Second, underground nuclear explosions themselves produce cavities that might collapse, possibly aiding in the detection of a clandestine event. Finally, because all mine-related events occur in the vicinity of underground cavities, they may come under special scrutiny because of the concern that very large, specially constructed cavities could be used to evasively decouple a clandestine test. For these reasons mine-related seismicity in both active and former mining regions have the potential to be false alarms under a CTBT. We are investigating techniques to identify collapses, either directly via waveform modeling, or indirectly by combining several seismic discriminants. We are also investigating the source mechanisms of coalbumps and collapses to better understand the performance of seismic discriminants for these events. In particular we have found similarities in point source models of some longwall coalbumps, room- and-pillar mine collapses and NTS nuclear explosion cavity collapses. In order to understand coalbumps we are analyzing events from central Utah recorded at regional distances in Utah and Nevada including at the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>station</b> ELK. Some of these have anomalous, explosion- like high frequency P/S ratios. We are combining this new study with results from previous field work done in 1995 at a Colorado long-wall coal mining operation. Similarly to longwall coal mines in Utah and elsewhere, this Colorado mine completely excavates a 3 m high coal seam in 250 m wide panels leaving the material above unsupported. The roof material above the excavated seam eventually collapses resulting in seismic events...|$|E
