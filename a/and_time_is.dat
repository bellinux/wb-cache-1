The evolving interest in space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> in cognitive science {{and some of the}} current conceptions of space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> briefly reviewed. It is argued that space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> not only structure cognitive representations and processes but also provide useful information for knowledge processing. Various ways of structuring space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> discussed <b>and</b> the merits of different languages for describing space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> addressed. In particular, qualitative and quantitative descriptions are related to local and global reference frames and crisp qualities are related to fuzzy quantities. The importance of selecting an appropriate level of interpretation for a given description is stressed. Examples of interpreting spatial and temporal object descriptions in various ways are presented...|$|R

5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special {{theory of relativity}} in 1905, Einstein started {{thinking about how to}} incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.|$|E

New to the series, the game also includes a single-player Battle Mode, which does not require that there be at least two human participants. As the first Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS, the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device's bottom touchscreen. They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart. However, the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions, making it difficult to control where to place items while racing.|$|E

[...] Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that [...] "Purple Haze" [...] is most likely [...] "a pot-pourri of ideas" [...] which Hendrix developed over time. [...] As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. [...] Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jose Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. [...] In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a [...] "purplish haze" [...] which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. [...] An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled [...] "Purple Haze – Jesus Saves", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> distorted. [...] In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, [...] "I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea."

The revelation of eternity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
