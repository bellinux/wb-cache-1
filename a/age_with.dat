5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (<b>AGE),</b> <b>with</b> effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as <b>AGE,</b> <b>with</b> approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E

Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice <b>Age,</b> <b>with</b> the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and the extinction of much of its prey, the Beringian wolf became extinct. The extinction of its prey has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves now living in remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E

5|$|Dog pups show {{unrestrained}} {{fighting with}} their siblings from 2 weeks of <b>age,</b> <b>with</b> injury avoided only {{due to their}} undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many people <b>ageing</b> <b>with</b> {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) age {{in place}} in group homes. Participation is a central concept in support and service to people <b>with</b> ID, but <b>age</b> is often a determining factor for participation among this group. Choice and control are dimensions of participation. Aim: The aim {{of this article is}} to explore how choice and control in the everyday life of people <b>ageing</b> <b>with</b> ID is expressed and performed in the group home’s semi-private spaces. Material and methods: Participant observations and interviews with residents and staff were conducted in four different group homes in Sweden that had older residents. Results: Four categories were found that can be understood as aspects of choice and control in the group home’s semi-private spaces in the everyday life of people <b>ageing</b> <b>with</b> ID. These categories included aspects such as space and object, time and routines, privacy, and a person-centred approach. Conclusion and significance: People <b>ageing</b> <b>with</b> ID are vulnerable when it comes to maintaining choice and control in various situations in the home’s semi-private spaces. It is argued that occupational therapists should include this occupational arena in their evaluations and interventions for people <b>ageing</b> <b>with</b> ID.
