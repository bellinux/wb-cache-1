Sympathetic neural {{control of}} afferent and efferent <b>arterioles</b> of inner {{cortical}} (juxtamedullary) glomeruli {{has not been}} established, in part, because of difficulty accessing these vessels, normally located deep below the kidney surface. In this study we utilized the rat hydronephrotic kidney model to visualize the renal microcirculation and to quantitate the responses of juxtamedullary <b>arterioles</b> to brief (30 sec) renal nerve stimulation (RNS). Juxtamedullary afferent and efferent <b>arterioles</b> constricted in a frequency-dependent fashion to RNS, achieving a maximal constriction of 35 % to 8 Hz stimulation. In these same kidneys, outer cortical afferent <b>arterioles</b> also constricted to RNS but outer cortical efferent <b>arterioles</b> did not. Microinjection of norepinephrine (NE) around single outer cortical efferent <b>arterioles</b> (to avoid the constriction of preglomerular vessels) constricted the efferent <b>arterioles.</b> However, the afferent <b>arterioles</b> of the same glomeruli were considerably more responsive to microinjected NE. Thus, the lack of constriction of outer cortical efferent <b>arterioles</b> to RNS may relate, in part, to their low sensitivity to NE, the primary neurotransmitter. These direct observations indicate that the juxtamedullary efferent <b>arterioles</b> are responsive to renal nerve stimulation whereas the outer cortical efferent vessels are not. These results, which should be cautiously extrapolated to normal filtering kidneys, indicate that glomerular hemodynamic changes evoked by the sympathetic nervous system are different for outer cortical and inner cortical glomeruli...|$|R
40|$|Objective—Exercise {{training}} {{has been shown}} to restore vasodilation to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation in <b>arterioles</b> distal to coronary artery occlusion. Because reactive oxygen species are generated during NOS uncoupling and the production of vasodilator H 2 O 2 is increased during exercise in patients with coronary disease, we proposed that H 2 O 2 may contribute to the restoration of vasodilation in porcine coronary occlusion model. Methods and Results—Left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery of miniature swine was progressively occluded for 8 weeks followed by exercise training (EX; 5 days/wk treadmill) or sedentary (SED) protocols for 12 weeks. <b>Arterioles</b> were isolated from distal LCX and nonoccluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery for in vitro study. Vasodilation to NOS activators adenosine and ionomycin was impaired in SED LCX, but not LAD, <b>arterioles.</b> This impairment was restored by L-arginine. NO production induced by adenosine was also reduced in SED LCX <b>arterioles.</b> EX had no effect on LAD <b>arterioles</b> but improved NO production and restored dilation of LCX <b>arterioles.</b> NOS blockade (L-NAME) inhibited vasodilation to NOS activators in LAD (SED & EX) <b>arterioles</b> but was ineffective in SED LCX <b>arterioles.</b> In EX LCX <b>arterioles,</b> vasodilation to NOS activators was slightly inhibited by L-NAME but abolished by catalase.

This study investigated the effects of age on flow-induced signaling and activation of nitric oxide (NO) -mediated vasodilation in coronary resistance <b>arterioles.</b> Coronary <b>arterioles</b> were isolated from young (∼ 6 mo) and old (∼ 24 mo) male Fischer- 344 rats to assess vasodilation to flow, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and ACh. Flow- and VEGF-induced vasodilation of coronary <b>arterioles</b> was impaired with age (P ≤ 0. 05); however, ACh-induced vasodilation was preserved with age. NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (1 × 10 − 5 M) eliminated vasodilation to flow, VEGF, and ACh, indicating dependence of these responses on NO. SU- 1498, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR, also known as Flk- 1), abolished age-related differences in flow-induced vasodilation. Flow-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk- 1 in coronary <b>arterioles</b> from young but not old rats and Flk- 1 protein was reduced in coronary <b>arterioles</b> from old rats compared with those from young rats.

We tested the hypothesis that increased KCa channel and Kv channel activity contribute to reduced myogenic responsiveness in skeletal muscle <b>arterioles</b> of aged rats. 1 A <b>arterioles</b> were isolated from soleus, an oxidative muscle, and superficial gastrocnemius, a glycolytic muscle, of young (4 mos) and aged (24 mos) Fischer 344 rats. Myogenic responses were assessed by increasing intraluminal pressure (0 - 140 cm H 2 O) in increments of 20 cm H 2 O. Vasoconstrictor response were determined in response to increasing concentrations of the KCa channel blocker, charybdotoxin (CTX; 10 - 10 to 10 - 7 M) and the Kv channel blocker, 4 -Aminopyridine (4 -AP; 10 - 5 to 10 - 2 M). To determine the role of potassium channels in modulating the myogenic response, cannulated <b>arterioles</b> from soleus and gastrocnemius were incubated with CTX (50 nM) and 4 -AP (5 mM) for 15 minutes prior to evaluation of the myogenic response. Increased Kv channel activity contributes to reduced myogenic constriction in soleus and gastrocnemius muscle <b>arterioles</b> from aged rats. In soleus muscle <b>arterioles,</b> KCa channel activity opposes myogenic tone in young but not old rats. In gastrocnemius muscle <b>arterioles,</b> treatment with CTX did not eliminate age-related differences in the myogenic response, and the KCa channel contribution to myogenic tone was, in fact, greater <b>arterioles</b> from young as compared to old rats. Kv channels contribute to greater myogenic constriction in soleus <b>arterioles,</b> KCa channels appear to be more active in gastrocnemius muscle <b>arterioles</b> as compared to soleus muscle <b>arterioles.</b> Therefore Kv and KCa channels are tonically active in skeletal muscle <b>arterioles,</b> contributing to a hyperpolarizing force that opposes myogenic constriction.

40|$|Introduction. The renin {{granulation}} {{of kidney}} <b>arterioles</b> is enhanced in diabetes {{despite the fact}} that the level of angiotensin II in the diabetic kidney is elevated. Therefore, the number of angiotensin II AT 1 -A and AT 1 -B receptors in afferent and efferent <b>arteriole’s</b> renin-positive and renin-negative smooth muscle cells (SMC) was estimated. Method. Immunohistochemistry at the electron microscopic level was combined with 3 D stereological sampling techniques. Results. In diabetes the enhanced downregulation of AT 1 -B receptors in the renin-positive than in the renin-negative SMCs in both <b>arterioles</b> was resulted: the significant difference in the number of AT 1 (AT 1 -A + AT 1 -B) receptors between the two types of SMCs in the normal rats was further increased in diabetes and in contrast with the significant difference observed between the afferent and efferent <b>arterioles</b> in the normal animals, there was no such difference in diabetes. Conclusions. The enhanced downregulation of the AT 1 -B receptors in the renin-negative SMCs in the efferent <b>arterioles</b> demonstrates that the regulation of the glomerular filtration rate by the pre- and postglomerular <b>arterioles</b> is changed in diabetes.

We evaluated the effects of age and chronic exercise on flow-induced vasodilatation and levels of NO and O 2 − in soleus muscle <b>arterioles.</b> Young (3 months) and old (22 months) male rats were exercise trained or remained sedentary (SED) for 10 weeks. Flow-stimulated NO and O 2 −, as well as BH 4 and l-arginine content, were determined in soleus muscle <b>arterioles.</b> Flow-induced vasodilatation was assessed under control conditions and during the blockade of O 2 − and/or hydrogen peroxide. Exercise training enhanced flow-induced vasodilatation in <b>arterioles</b> from young and old rats. Old age reduced, and exercise training restored, BH 4 content and flow-stimulated NO availability. Flow-stimulated, eNOS-derived O 2 − levels were higher in <b>arterioles</b> from old SED compared to those from young SED rats. Exercise training increased flow-stimulated eNOS-derived O 2 − levels in <b>arterioles</b> from young but not old rats. O 2 − scavenging with Tempol reduced flow-induced vasodilatation from all groups except young SED rats. Addition of catalase to Tempol-treated <b>arterioles</b> eliminated flow-induced vasodilatation in <b>arterioles</b> from all groups. Catalase reduced flow-induced vasodilatation from all groups. In Tempol-treated <b>arterioles,</b> flow-induced vasodilatation was restored by deferoxamine, an iron chelator. These data indicate that uncoupling of eNOS contributes to the age-related decline in flow-induced vasodilatation; however, reactive oxygen species are required for flow-induced vasodilatation in soleus muscle <b>arterioles</b> from young and old rats...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{renal failure}} (CRF) is {{frequently}} accompanied by systemic vascular alterations which further increase the {{morbidity and mortality}} of these patients. However, the nature and the underlying mechanisms of vascular dysfunction are not completely understood. We hypothesized that [...] {{in addition to other}} factors [...] CRF alters local vasomotor mechanisms that are intrinsic to the vascular wall. METHODS: Changes in the diameter of isolated, pressurized (at 80 mm Hg) gracilis skeletal muscle <b>arterioles</b> (diameter approximately 150 microm) of female Wistar rats were investigated by videomicroscopy. Arteriolar responses to an increase in flow and vasoactive agents in partially nephrectomized (NX) and sham-operated (control) rats were compared. RESULTS: In NX rats, serum creatinine and urine protein excretion were increased. Compared to controls, increases in intraluminal flow (from 0 to 40 microl/min) resulted in significantly reduced dilation in <b>arterioles</b> of NX rats (maximum: 32 +/- 4 vs. 15 +/- 4 microm, p < 0. 05). Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with L-NAME reduced the dilation of control <b>arterioles</b> but did not affect responses of NX <b>arterioles.</b> Also, dilations in response to histamine were significantly reduced in <b>arterioles</b> from NX rats as compared to control rats. L-NAME significantly decreased histamine-induced dilations of control <b>arterioles,</b> but it did not affect responses of NX <b>arterioles.</b> Dilations in response to the NO donor sodium nitroprusside were also significantly decreased in NX <b>arterioles</b> as compared to responses of control vessels, whereas responses to adenosine and norepinephrine were not significantly different in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in rat skeletal muscle <b>arterioles,</b> CRF induced by renal mass reduction alters the mechanosensitive and agonist-induced responses of peripheral <b>arterioles,</b> in part by interfering with NO-signaling mechanisms. These alterations could contribute to increased peripheral vascular resistance and further aggravate the cardiovascular complications in CRF...|$|R

The {{purpose was to}} determine if increased vasoconstrictor reactivity, decreased vasodilator reactivity and alterations in the structural properties of 1 A <b>arterioles</b> from both high-oxidative and low-oxidative glycolytic skeletal muscles is present during prediabetes as well as acute and chronic diabetes, and to determine if this dysfunction precedes the development of elevated arterial pressure in type 2 diabetes. Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats and lean age-matched controls were studied at 7 (prediabetes), 13 (acute diabetes) and 20 (chronic diabetes) weeks of age. Following measurement of arterial pressure, vasoconstrictor responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and increasing intraluminal pressure (MYO), vasodilator responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and intraluminal flow and passive mechanical properties were examined in <b>arterioles</b> from soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. Vasoconstriction to NE was enhanced in gastrocnemius muscle <b>arterioles</b> during prediabetes and preceded elevated arterial pressure. Alterations in the passive mechanical properties of <b>arterioles</b> from both muscles were observed throughout the progression of diabetes. Flow-induced vasodilation was decreased in the high-oxidative muscle <b>arterioles</b> during acute diabetes, and was coincident with the emergence of elevated arterial pressure.

50|$|NSAIDs {{are also}} {{associated}} with a fairly high incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on the kidney and over time can lead to chronic kidney disease. The mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow. Prostaglandins normally dilate the afferent arterioles of the glomeruli. This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an indicator of kidney function. This is particularly important in kidney failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels.
