5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce <b>a</b> <b>pole</b> of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce <b>a</b> <b>pole</b> of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges, {{much like}} clan tartans, {{do not have}} a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century.

50|$|The Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) is {{a smaller}} {{backpack}} propulsion system {{intended as a}} safety device during space walks. It contains 1.4 kg of gaseous nitrogen, which provides much less delta-v capability than the MMU, roughly 10 feet per second (3 meters per second). However SAFER is less complex, less expensive and simpler to use than the MMU, and the limited delta-v is sufficient for the intended rescue-only task. Other Crew Self Rescue (CSR) devices of which prototypes have been developed include <b>an</b> inflatable <b>pole,</b> <b>a</b> telescoping <b>pole,</b> <b>a</b> bi-stem <b>pole</b> and <b>a</b> bola-type lasso device (astrorope) the drifting astronaut could throw to hook to the space station.|$|R

5|$|Although today crest badges {{are more}} {{commonly}} used by clan members, the original badges worn by clansmen were plant badges or clan badges.
