As a result we can perceive <b>the</b> tendency <b>for</b> a given subject being treated differently, according to the course where it is taught. Thus, teaching electronics is different in an Electronics Course than in an Electric Power Systems Course. In the first this subject assumes some deepness while in the second it is, at best, only superficially presented. This strategy presents some <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>student,</b> like cost and time requirements, and mainly the ability to move quickly into the labor market. Nevertheless we can identify some crucial drawbacks in this approach, mainly the very weak skill level attained in some crucial subjects, usually in the boundary between established knowledge areas. So, instead of getting solid skills about crucial electric and electronic components, students are often presented with simpler interface models, i. e. electronic "black boxes". Later on, when faced with a specific type of problems, graduated student are hardly able to identify solutions, due to their inherent lack of interdisciplinary skills. This work presents some perceptions related with the lack of some electronic concepts in engineering students, necessary to understand the implications on the electric power grid resulting from the use of non-linear loads. A methodology to characterize this situation and alternatives to overcome it are also presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

A computer could give the teacher a tool for analyzing and evaluating overall instruction, and at the same time give attention to specific needs of individual <b>students.</b> Among <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> were increased learning time, helpful feedback, and evaluation of objectives learned.

Keeping track {{of the content of}} daily work can give an idea of the evolution and development of ideas.

Moreover the evolution of thinking on a longer time scale can also be overseen. Notebooks are not only used among designers, engineers but also by scientists; they call them mostly 'lab journals'.

In the second part we will pay attention to the development of content and techniques to improve the quality of notebooks as teaching aid. These principles form also <b>the</b> basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> criteria <b>for</b> assessment and marking of notebooks. In the last part we will conclude how notebooks can be integrated in today's curricula for design schools.

40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of literature, four {{different}} approaches to teaching introductory programming are identified and described. Examples {{of the practice of}} each approach are identified representing procedural, visual, and object-oriented programming language paradigms. Each approach is then further analysed, identifying <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> and <b>the</b> teacher. The first approach, code analysis, is analogous to reading before writing, that is, recognising the parts and what they mean. It requires learners to analyse and understand existing code prior to producing their own. An alternative is the building blocks approach, analogous to learning vocabulary, nouns and verbs, before constructing sentences. A third approach is identified as simple units in which learners master solutions to small problems before applying the learned logic to more complex problems. The final approach, full systems, is analogous to learning a foreign language by immersion whereby learners design a solution to a non-trivial problem and the programming concepts and language constructs are introduced only when the solution to the problem requires their application. The conclusion asserts that competency in programming cannot be achieved without mastering each of the approaches, at least to some extent. Use of the approaches in combination could provide novice programmers with the opportunities to acquire a full range of knowledge, understanding, and skills. Several orders <b>for</b> presenting <b>the</b> approaches in the classroom are proposed and analysed reflecting the needs of the learners and teachers. Further research is needed to better understand these and other approaches to teaching programming, not in terms of learner outcomes, but in terms of teachers’ actions and techniques employed to facilitate the construction of new knowledge by the learners.

40|$|Students {{working on}} {{engineering}} design project teams face many challenges including information management. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> collaborate among themselves, share design knowledge, and negotiate with each other, {{faculty members and}} the client, {{in order to create}} engineered artifacts. This process often involves reuse of prior knowledge and the creation of new knowledge {{within the context of the}} problem. Although some of the work is done individually, a major portion is accomplished through team interactions, either in meetings with the project team or with subsets of <b>the</b> team. <b>Students</b> communicate in face-to-face meetings, on the phone, via email, in chat sessions and with text messages; and they exchange text, images, web links, equations, and technical drawings. However, as the project proceeds, locating the right piece of information from the multiple sources becomes an increasingly difficult task. Prior studies have shown that students often have different perceptions of the project and their contribution in it (Laurillard 1979). Externalizing the shared vision as the project evolves can have <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> Since most of the knowledge creation by <b>students</b> occurs without <b>the</b> instructor present, <b>students</b> often deviate from the project’s stated objective. Instructors intend to assess student learning outcomes, but have more ready access to product outcomes. Given this constraint, the final grade is often based on the quality of the product and on the self-reported functioning of the team. Even in cases where <b>the</b> evidence of <b>student</b> collaboration process is accessible through discussion forums and e-mail threads, making sense of this data is difficult due to a lack of practical, analytical tools to aggregate the information. Towards a Framework to Support Engineering Design <b>Student</b> Projects vi <b>The</b> first research question of this thesis addresses the problem of information management in engineering design projects. The students’ design deliberations, as externalized in their discussion threads and through the documents they create or reference, can be visualized by mining the textual evidence they produce as natural part of their collaboration process. By using computational linguistic techniques and machine learning, all <b>the</b> documents and <b>student</b> discussion threads are aggregated, and a sample concept-map based graphical representation is created that can be used to navigate the project corpus. This approach is referred to as DesignWebs. DesignWebs can be viewed as an assemblage of related noun phrases reveal the current state of the project and the underlying structure of the design. DesignWebs assist as navigation aids in contextualizing and viewing project archives by structuring the design information as graphs of related entities. The second research question presents noun phrases as a surrogate measure for design team dynamics. This question builds on prior research about using noun phrases as objective measure for measuring design team performance (Mabogunje 1997), and uses them <b>for</b> exploring how <b>the</b> design vocabulary of student teams expands and contracts during a design project. The expansion and contraction reflect <b>the</b> <b>students</b> brainstorming about different design alternatives <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project and finalizing certain design solutions respectively. This question also shows that tracking the noun phrases as they are introduced by one team and shared across team boundaries can reveal insights about whether the teams are successfully collaborating. Tracking the design vocabulary over time shows how the design vocabulary related to a team’s assigned tasks keeps on getting refined as the project progresses, reflecting the domain expertise gained by the Towards a Framework to Support Engineering Design Student Projects vii team. The shared vocabulary between teams also mirrors the project’s work-flow, as it is represented in the artifact’s system architecture diagram. Finally this question shows how instructors can see the changes in a team’s design knowledge by monitoring its DesignWebs, as they are created at different milestones during the project. The third research question presents DesignWebs as a research framework that facilitates the validation of prior research findings about the functioning and assessment of design project teams by obviating the tedious data pre-processing steps. Three diverse research studies are examined to demonstrate the wide applicability of DesignWebs as a platform: the first examines whether using the semantic coherence of student communications in team-based project courses can act as an indicator of the progress of the design process (Song et al. 2003); the second examines whether applying metrics on the “communication artifacts” generated by computer supported collaborative tools can provide insights into the design process that created them (Dutoit 1996); the third explores various individual and group work processes that when made more explicit to instructors can assist them in carrying out the assessment processes (Gweon 2008). This research contributes to supporting engineering design student projects by presenting a framework that organizes and evaluates a variety of potential metrics and design assessment measures based on the text products in a given project corpus. It also presents an interface that summarizes the team’s online communications and documentation to track the emergence of the shared solution and extent of team collaboration, using noun phrases as a surrogate measure. Finally, this research presents a research test bed that brings together a number of research hypotheses Towards a Framework to Support Engineering Design Student Projects viii related to collaborative design projects by demonstrating that they can complement the instructors’ understanding of how teams are working...|$|R
40|$|English {{literature}} {{is one of}} the subjects that has been taught in English Department. By studying literature, students will get many <b>advantages,</b> <b>for</b> example: providing <b>the</b> <b>students</b> with a lot of fun and enjoyment of the reading. More than that, it also gives valuable information related to the values of life, widens the knowledge, understand human struggle. That is the reason why the writer analyzes literary work especially novel and focused on struggle as the topic of the thesis. This study has three main purposes; those are to explain Sarah’s efforts to establish Jewel business, to describe her challenges, and to describe how she face the challenges. This study uses descriptive qualitative research because it did not need treatment to gain the data like in experimental research. Dealing with the study, the writer uses objective approach because it is fully concerned with the object in the cases of Danielle Steel’s novel especially on the Sarah struggle to establish jewel business. The result of the study shows that there are two efforts to establish jewel business, first is Sarah start to buy Jewels offered for sale by impoverished war survivors. With Sarah’s style and keen eye the collection becomes the prestigious Whitfield’s Jewelry store in Paris. Second, she expands the Jewelry business to London and Rome. The challenges are material and mental or moral challenges. Sarah material struggle is trying out to take care of quality product of its Jewels. And her mental struggle to keep her business although her husband William has died. Moreover, Sarah’s ways to overcome the challenges are by working hard to make sketches of things and trying to make sketches to sell to the Queen’s. Finally the shop got them off to a royal start and the rest of items they sold that month could have kept them in business for a year. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} parents´ {{involvement}} in primary {{education in the}} marginalized areas of Guayaquil, Ecuador. In literature on education and development, parents are seen as vital actors which can contribute to educational improvement, especially in resource scarce environments. The study has a comparative research design with private and public primary schools as the contrasting cases. <b>The</b> rationale <b>for</b> this comparative aspect {{is the assumption that}} how much parents invest in education in the form of tuition fees or other financial contributions might influence their level of participation in the school. Therefore, parents´ involvement has been compared in two private fee-paying schools and three public schools, which are free of charge, in the marginalized Northwest part of Guayaquil. Social Capital Theory is used as an analytical framework, with a discussion of relationships and networks which are brought about as a result of parents´ involvement in the school and how these can provide <b>advantages</b> or benefits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> <b>the</b> parents and the school itself. Findings from the study indicate that the marginalized context is a factor which necessitates involvement from the parents in the school and also cooperation between the parents and the school. Both parts (the parents and the school) will see the value of having a good relationship with each other and building social capital in the network. This is the case both in the private and the public schools. The comparison of the findings from the private and the public schools show that one mayor difference {{is the extent to which}} the parents help out with manual labour. Payment of fees is used by the parents in the private schools as an argument for not participating in this, whereas parents in the public schools do help out with manual labour. Thus, charging parents for their children´s education is a factor which may negatively affect some types of parents´ involvement. Regarding other types of involvement, such as attendance at parent meetings, there are no clear differences between the private and the public schools. This implies that payment of fees does not necesssarily lead the parents to get more involved in school in order to make their voice heard. However, also parents in the public schools contribute with some voluntary Financial contributions. The study concludes that these contributions, together with their contributions in kind in form of manual labour, may lead the parents in the public schools to expect to have a say in school related matters. This may further positively affect the degree to which they involve themselves in the School...|$|R

In Germany, 8 of the 16 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industrial clerks, and 8 provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> logistic clerks. In Switzerland, DIF was equally distributed across the branches: 5 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industrial clerks, and 6 provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> logistic clerks. An advantage {{means that the}} item difficulty is lower for this group than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other group. The differences in item difficulty {{between the two groups}} varied between 0.26 and 1.26 logist, which is approximately 0.5 to 2.3 times the standard deviation of the latent variable (GermanySD =  0.84, SwitzerlandSD =  0.54). The share of items that provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reference respondents of the focal group is approximately 50 / 50.
