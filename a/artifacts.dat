5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful <b>artifacts,</b> which then spawn at random ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the <b>artifacts,</b> and defeat the Guardian. The prices of the <b>artifacts</b> increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and <b>artifacts</b> gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian <b>artifacts</b> {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, {{religious}} gowns and religious paintings. The <b>artifacts</b> were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, {{but they have been}} lost since. The <b>artifacts</b> are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, {{historian}} Herbert Eugene Bolton identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as {{the location}} of Fort St. Louis. Other historians, before and after Bolton, argued that the fort was located on Lavaca River in Jackson County. Five decades later, the University of Texas at Austin funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, {{a part of the}} Keeran ranch. Although several thousand items were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish <b>artifacts</b> of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued. In the 1970s, the <b>artifacts</b> were reexamined by Kathleen Gilmore, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. She determined that while most of the <b>artifacts</b> were Spanish, some definitively matched <b>artifacts</b> recovered from French and French-Canadian excavations of the same time period.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} team began site excavation on March 3. Workers excavated <b>artifacts</b> {{dating to}} around 1150 AD. Fire pits and broken pieces of ceramic pans {{were found in}} the ground below what would be left field. Archaeologists believe the area was the site of a Native American settlement and that the <b>artifacts</b> were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. The <b>artifacts</b> are on permanent display in the Tennessee State Museum's Mississippian Period exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.|$|E

5|$|A {{rich source}} of Late Paleolithic sites and <b>artifacts</b> (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the Prądnik River Valley.

5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no <b>artifacts</b> have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few <b>artifacts</b> from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture <b>artifacts</b> can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Artifact</b> {{is common}} in cardiac RR {{interval}} data derived from 24 -hr recordings and has {{a significant impact on}} heart rate variability (HRV) measures. However, the relative impact of progressively added <b>artifact</b> on a large group of commonly used HRV measures has not been assessed. This study compared the relative sensitivity of 38 commonly used HRV measures to <b>artifact</b> to determine which measures show the most change with increasing increments of <b>artifact.</b> A secondary aim was to ascertain whether short-term and long-term HRV measures, as groups, share similarities in their sensitivity to <b>artifact.</b> Methods: Up to 10 % of <b>artifact</b> was added to 20 artificial RR (ARR) files and 20 human cardiac recordings, which had been assessed for <b>artifact</b> by a cardiac technician. The added <b>artifact</b> simulated deletion of RR intervals and insertion of individual short RR intervals. Thirty-eight HRV measures were calculated for each file. Regression analysis was used to rank the HRV measures according to their sensitivity to <b>artifact</b> as determined by the magnitude of slope. Results: RMSSD, SDANN, SDNN, RR triangular index and TINN, normalized power and relative power linear measures, and most nonlinear methods examined are most robust to <b>artifact.</b> Conclusion: Short-term time domain HRV measures are more sensitive to added <b>artifact</b> than long-term measures. Absolute power frequency domain measures across all frequency bands are more sensitive than normalized and relative frequency domain measures. Most nonlinear HRV measures assessed were relatively robust to added <b>artifact,</b> with Poincare plot SD 1 being most sensitive. No Full Tex...|$|R
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of <b>artifacts</b> or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, <b>artifacts</b> may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve <b>Artifacts,</b> which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve <b>Artifacts,</b> the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve <b>Artifacts</b> already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
