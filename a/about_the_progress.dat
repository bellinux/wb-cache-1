5|$|The Excellency of Works, {{also known}} as the Minister of Works, was less {{powerful}} than his previous counterpart, the Imperial Counselor. This official's advisory and censorial responsibilities coincided with those of two other Excellencies, forming a tripartite cabinet arrangement. Unlike the abolished Imperial Counselor, he was given the specialized role of overseeing public works projects throughout the empire. The Excellency of Works was responsible for the construction of city walls, towns, canals, irrigation ditches, dykes and dams, and other structural engineering projects. The Court Architect supervised only imperial building projects. The Excellency of Works made annual reports to the throne <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> of local administrations' conduct of construction projects. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan, Minister of Finance, and Minister Steward.|$|E

5|$|One and a {{half years}} after the start of Zarb-e-Azb, phenomenal successes were achieved, with the last pockets close to the Pakistan-Afghan border being cleared. Terrorist {{backbone}} broken and structure dismantled. Nexus with sleeper cells largely disrupted. Intelligence based Operations (IBOs) busted remaining sleeper cells. 3,400 terrorists were killed, with 837 hideouts from where they were carrying out terrorist activities destroyed. During the last 18 months over 13,200 IBOs carried out across the country in which 183 terrorists were killed, 2,193 arrested. IBOs continue. 488 officers and men of Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps KPK, Baluchistan, Rangers Sindh were killed and 1,914 injured in Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Total 11 military courts. 142 cases referred to military courts. 55 cases decided, 87 cases in process. 31 terrorists convicted. In July, the Pakistan Army Chief, General Raheel Sharif visited the military's forward-most positions near the Afghan border in North Waziristan He was briefed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> and future plans for Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Sharif also visited South Waziristan and Wana agencies. It was reported that the Pakistani military had just completed the preliminary preparations for final phase.

5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress.</b> Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E

40|$|Taxonomy is the {{discipline}} {{in charge of}} cataloguing biological diversity. However, {{in conjunction with the}} loss of biodiversity, there has been a crisis of this science. The lack of interest for taxonomy has lead to an insufficient number of current specialists dedicated to the arduous task of discovering and cataloguing existent life. In this context, molecular taxonomy provides a system which makes use of the available advances in technology, to contribute with this enterprise: the DNA barcoding. In this paper, we talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> reached with this initiative, and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issues that have caused a polemic debate about its achievements and shortcomings. Besides, some considerations are made <b>about</b> <b>the</b> opportunities and possibilities to implement DNA barcoding for cataloguing biodiversity at Cuba. ...|$|R

25|$|By November 1840, Samuel Ward had died, and Cogswell began {{residing}} with Astor {{and his son}} William B. Astor. Sometimes he had {{a downtown}} office at his disposal. Cogswell was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> of {{the plans for the}} library, and in 1842 threatened to take an offer to be secretary of legation under Washington Irving, now appointed American minister to Spain. Astor then agreed that more formal work could begin on the library: as soon as the building was finished, Cogswell was to be librarian with a salary of $2,500 a year; meanwhile he was to receive $2,000 while working on the catalog. Thus matters stood until Astor's death in 1848: Cogswell lived with or near Astor, and worked on plans for the library as opportunity offered.|$|E

He was instructed that if he became convinced that the battery was advanced for the purpose of immediate attack then he would be justified in firing on it but if it was only being moved for the purposes of general emplacement that he should exercise forbearance.|$|E

Then the field tests and applications were also introduced to make a further research. The study reveals that current research were not enough to promote the wider application of ECE. And finally orientations for further research were also put forward explicitly based on this research, which would guide and facilitate the future study of ECE and enlarge its application...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to conducting traditional research in laboratory settings, neuroscientists {{have also been}} involved in the promotion of awareness and knowledge about the nervous system among the general public and government officials. Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations. For example, individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee, which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide. In the United States, large organizations such as the Society for Neuroscience have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts, collaborating with public school teachers to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K-12 teachers and students, and cosponsoring a campaign with the Dana Foundation called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> and benefits of brain research.

40|$|Although Queen Elizabeth I of England made summer {{journeys}} or progresses {{almost every}} year from 1559 to 1602 very {{little attention has been}} focused on them and on the reasons for or the results of these trips. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold: (1) to describe <b>the</b> summer <b>progresses</b> and (2) to arrive at some conclusions as to the significance of <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> <b>The</b> principal source of this paper is the three volume Nichols? collection of original documents concerning <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> These documents were collected from widely varying sources and published in 1823 by a printer named John Nichols. This material, either in the Nichols? collection or in the original, is the only source of information on <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> Every secondary work examined by the author of this paper used one of these sources for his information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> <b>The</b> main significance of <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> was to allow the crown to keep in personal touch with the provincial officials and with the general public. Both the people and the officials were appreciative of this royal attention and it contributed to the favorable public opinion which Elizabeth enjoyed during her entire reign. The public exposure which <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> gave to Elizabeth created a bond between the Queen and her subjects which enabled her to govern with a freer hand than she would have been able to do otherwise. Of secondary importance these journeys allowed the Queen a chance to relax somewhat from the formality of the court and to enjoy some of the sporting entertainments such as hunting which were impossible to do in London...|$|R
