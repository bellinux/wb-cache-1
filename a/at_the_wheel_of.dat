5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> the truck due to taking {{a combination of}} pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes {{to discover that the}} truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

But it is highly worth remarking, that this very incident of dragging the body of Hector thrice round the walls of Troy, is absolutely not mentioned by Homer.

25|$|Maria Antonietta Avanzo (née Bellan) {{was born}} in 1889 at Contarina, now Porto Viro, near Rovigo and learned to drive on her father's De Dion-Bouton tricycle. Before the Great War she married Baron Eustachio Avanzo, with whom she later had two children, and they moved to Rome. Both her father and her husband {{encouraged}} her driving talents, and Eustachio bought her a 35hp SPA sportscar to race. In 1920 she began her racing career <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> the SPA 35/50 in the Giro del Lazio.|$|E
25|$|These drivers' successes {{throughout}} the year gave Ford the manufacturers' title, {{the only time the}} company had achieved this until the 2006 season, when Marcus Grönholm and Mikko Hirvonen won the title for Ford in Ford Focus RS WRC 06. Vatanen won the drivers' title in 1981, again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> an RS1800. This victory came despite the arrival on the WRC scene of the venerable four-wheel drive Audi Quattro. Ford placed in the top three in the manufacturers' championship for the sixth year in a row.|$|E
25|$|Gorshin's slender {{athletic}} build, wide mouth, {{and pale}} eyes under strong brows were ideal characteristics for screen henchmen. In 1957, {{he fell asleep}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> his car after driving from Pittsburgh for thirty-nine hours without sleep and subsequently, the vehicle crashed. He {{was on his way}} to a Hollywood screen test for the role of Petty Officer Ruby in Run Silent, Run Deep.

50|$|In 414, Constantius {{attacked}} Ataulf, who proclaimed Priscus Attalus emperor again. Constantius drove Ataulf into Hispania, and Attalus, having again lost Visigoth support, {{was captured}} and deposed. In the eleventh consulship of Honorius {{and the second}} of Constantius, the Emperor entered Rome in triumph, with Attalus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> his chariot. Honorius punished Attalus by cutting off his right finger and thumb, inflicting the same fate that Attalus threatened Honorius with. Remembering how Attalus had suggested that Honorius should retire to some small island, he returned the favor by banishing Attalus to the island of Lipara.|$|R
50|$|The first Focus World Rally Car {{made its}} debut in {{rallying}} and the World Rally Championship on the 1999 Monte Carlo Rally with Colin McRae and Simon Jean-Joseph <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two cars, replacing, {{for the first time}} in a generation, the Escort. It was immediately on the pace, setting many fastest stage times, but a vehicle weight issue meant that the two cars were excluded from that event. McRae went on to give the Focus WRC its maiden victory on the Safari Rally in February of the same year, and took victory again in the following rally, the Rally Portugal.|$|R

25|$|Victory went to Schumacher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> a Ferrari in appalling conditions. It was {{something}} of a farce, for in addition to the pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10sec for passing another racer under a yellow flag. The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his stop go penalty in the pits, after the race was over! McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with Häkkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari.|$|E
25|$|Patsy Burt's {{introduction}} to motor sport was through her father, Eric Burt, who was himself an accomplished racing driver. After initially disliking {{visits to the}} Brooklands circuit to watch her father and others competing on the high speed Surrey banking, following World War II she trained as a riding instructor. However, she remained in contact with motor racing through her father's involvement with the Junior Car Club, and occasionally spectated at the Goodwood Circuit, one of Britain's few post-war motor racing venues. Eventually she was tempted into taking part herself, and began her driving career <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> a Jowett Javelin in 1953.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry also {{revealed}} that Clarke's medical history contained episodes of dizziness and fainting dating from the 1970s {{and that he had}} previously suffered a blackout while <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> a First Glasgow bus, which was in service but stationary at a bus stop. It was stated that Clarke had been passed fit to return to work as a bus driver owing to failures by both the bus company's doctor and Clarke's own General Practitioner (GP) to spot that Clarke had changed his account of events, telling his GP that the episode had occurred in the canteen, which the GP then attributed to the hot conditions and deemed to be unlikely to be repeated.|$|E
50|$|John Hawxhurst helped Union {{forces as}} a guide and by {{identifying}} loyalists for General Winfield Hancock in Washington D.C. Asked to help the Restored Government of Virginia, Hawxhurst spent considerable time in Wheeling in what became West Virginia {{by the end of}} 1863, which prompted retaliation against his Fairfax County property. Hawxhurst was one of Fairfax County's two delegates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention <b>of</b> 1861 (alongside his neighbor, Maine-born Ebenezer E. Mason(1829-1910)). Hawxhurst was Fairfax County's sole delegate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly <b>at</b> <b>Wheeling</b> in July 1-26, 1961 and December 2, 1861-February 13, 1862 (no-one represented Fairfax County <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wheeling</b> session <b>of</b> December 4, 1862 - February 5, 1863).|$|R
50|$|Early funiculars {{used two}} {{parallel}} straight tracks, four rails, with separate station platforms for each vehicle. The tracks are laid with sufficient {{space between them}} for the two cars to pass <b>at</b> <b>the</b> midpoint. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars are usually single-flanged, as on standard railway vehicles. Examples {{of this type of}} track layout are the Duquesne Incline in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and most cliff railways in the UK.|$|R
60|$|At length, however, {{though he}} would not go himself, he allowed his {{intimate}} friend, whose name was Patroclus, to take his armor and go into battle. Patroclus was at first successful, but was soon killed by Hector, the brother of Paris. This aroused anger and a spirit of revenge {{in the mind of}} Achilles. He gave up his quarrel with Agamemnon and returned to the combat. He did not remit his exertions till he had slain Hector, and then he expressed his brutal exultation, and satisfied his revenge, by dragging <b>the</b> dead body <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> his chariot around the walls of the city. He then sold the body to the distracted father for a ransom.|$|R
