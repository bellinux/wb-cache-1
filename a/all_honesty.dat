In 1572, the Huguenot Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre, wrote from the court to warn her son Henry that Catherine presided over a [...] "vicious and corrupt" [...] atmosphere, in which the women made the sexual advances and not the men.

[...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision.

500|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of F minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B3 to the high-note of A5. Aside from Dupri's verses, Carey's longtime background singer Trey Lorenz makes a notable impression on the song, and earned credits for providing background vocals. Lyrically, the song is written in a female perspective, where they ask the man for their number at a club. In an interview with MTV News, Carey jokingly addressed the lyrics, claiming Dupri [...] "really {{wanted it to be}} coming from the girl, like 'can I get your number' to the guy. But in <b>all</b> <b>honesty</b> that would never be me!" [...] Aside from her signature vocals, Carey adopts a breathy rap for parts of the song, which read [...] "I got a pimp penthouse / With a sick hot tub / We can watch a flat screen / While the bubbles filling up." [...] According to Jozen Cummings from PopMatters, the lyrics and Carey's vocal switch make the song [...] "fun and comedic".|$|E

Of course, the film seems more consistent, {{but that may be}} because we've already traveled this maze once. While leaving, we might remain calmer, but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and puerility." [...] A positive review came from L'Express, written by Laurent Djian, who compared the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising in a way that influenced the perception of time. [...] "In 2010, no other filmmaker [...] than Gaspar Noé can shoot with such mastery, nor draw us into a vortex of sensations as vertiginous." [...] Ouest-Frances critic, on the other hand, was immensely bored by the film, and called it [...] "a padding of simple ideas, stereotypes and cliches in a heap of contrived and vain images which think they're technical prowess.

He maintained the standard the following season; Dover's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds, he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him. Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match, Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of £50,000 later that same week. BBC Sport's 2000–01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would miss him, a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker, who described the 1999–2000 season as [...] "a year when we had players like Simon Wormull, Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team.

500|$|Once {{he had the}} sound, {{he rolled}} off the bottom to [...] "take the muddiness out". It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and in <b>all</b> <b>honesty,</b> whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something you like about it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E

Clash magazine commented that it could be [...] "the band's most complete work to date. Worth the wait, and in <b>all</b> <b>honesty</b> better than we could ever have hoped for." [...] The Financial Post states that [...] "Tonight is the band's best album: Paradoxically, they've allowed themselves a degree of release from their characteristic tension by creating structures within which they can cut loose." [...] The Telegraph commented on how Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is a melody-packed re-affirmation of everything that has made the band so popular hitherto, but with a highly contemporary-sounding, keyboard-driven edge. The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one.

Annabel Leathes of BBC Online deemed it [...] "calorific as the KFC burgers dished up at her chav-style wedding; twenty finger lickin' tracks that mirror her trajectory from pretty pop puff to lusty strumpet". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press stated that it was premature for Spears to release a greatest hits album compilation after only five years, but highlighted [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime". Andy Petch-Jex of MusicOMH highlighted the first four tracks and commented [...] "true some of the tunes are complete pony plops, but beneath the occasional reek there beats a solid gold pop heart".|$|E

Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes."

I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In <b>all</b> <b>honesty,</b> the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title."

[...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious.

[...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in <b>all</b> <b>honesty,</b> it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years.
