5|$|As a redshirt {{freshman}} for the 2015 Wolverines, Speight began {{the season as}} a backup to Jake Rudock and Shane Morris. Speight made his Michigan debut on September 12, 2015, taking kneel-down snaps in the closing minutes of a victory over Oregon State. Asked why he played Speight instead of Morris {{at the end of}} the Oregon State game, head coach Jim Harbaugh explained that he did not want to burn Morris's redshirt year on <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> snap, emphasizing that Morris remained his No. 2 quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has {{the image of a}} queen but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil also appears to be mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 and stands on the stairway of Structure 13. Stela 91 is another very late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E
5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Kindt joined a backfield which {{contained}} quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee, the primary starter at halfback. That season Kindt rushed for 266 {{yards and two}} touchdowns on 61 carries. One of his touchdowns was <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49–7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in the backfield. A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28–0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 carries, an average of 2.9 yards per carry during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|During {{the repair}} efforts, Yar becomes close to Castillo, but is unnerved by tense {{interactions}} with Guinan. Guinan reveals to Yar {{that she knows}} Yar dies <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> death in the other timeline, and that the two should never have met. Based on her discussion with Guinan, Yar requests a transfer to the Enterprise-C, which is granted by Picard. As the Enterprise-C prepares to return through the anomaly, three Klingon battlecruisers attack. With the anomaly becoming unstable, Picard orders the Enterprise-D to cover the Enterprise-C's withdrawal. The Enterprise-D suffers major crew losses under the Klingon barrage, including the death of Commander Riker, forcing Picard to man the tactical station himself. With the Enterprise-D {{on the brink of}} destruction, the Enterprise-C traverses the anomaly, triggering the return of Enterprise-D's original timeline. In the restored timeline, Guinan– the only one subtly aware of what has transpired– asks Geordi La Forge to tell her more about Yar.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E

25|$|Huxley was a {{prominent}} member of the British Eugenics Society, and was Vice-President (1937–1944) and President (1959–1962).

25|$|After the tie, McNabb {{struggled}} {{in a game}} against the Baltimore Ravens, going 8-of-18 for 54 yards with two interceptions, a fumble, and being sacked twice. In the second half, Andy Reid decided to go with Kevin Kolb, who was in his second year in the league. This was McNabb's first time being benched for something other than injury or <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> game. In the game, Kolb threw an interception that was returned 108 yards for a touchdown by safety Ed Reed, breaking the record he previously held for longest interception returned for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought opposed each other. The leading school {{was that of the}} formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the {{foremost}} proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert's program, which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means. The main opponent was the intuitionist school, led by L. E. J. Brouwer, which resolutely discarded formalism as <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> game with symbols (van Dalen, 2008). The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time.|$|E
25|$|Following Husserl, Sartre views absurdity as {{a quality}} of all {{existing}} objects (and of the material world collectively), independent of any stance humans might take with respect to them. Our consciousness of an object does not inhere in the object itself. Thus in the early portions of the novel, Roquentin, who takes no attitude towards objects and has no stake in them, is totally estranged from the world he experiences. The objects themselves, in their brute existence, have only participation in <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> flow of events: they are superfluous. This alienation from objects casts doubt for him, in turn, on his own validity and even his own existence.|$|E

50|$|A platitude is <b>a</b> trite, <b>meaningless,</b> or prosaic statement, {{generally}} {{directed at}} quelling social, emotional, or cognitive unease. Platitudes are geared towards presenting a shallow, unifying wisdom over a difficult topic. However, {{they are too}} general and overused to be anything more than undirected statements with ultimately little meaningful contribution towards a solution.|$|R
25|$|Mazzoni resurrects {{the ancient}} {{tradition}} of linking poetry to rhetoric, {{which also has}} the credible, rather than the true, as its object. Interestingly, he also gives great importance to poetry’s effect on the audience as a determinant of quality – though he admits {{that much of the}} exercise of poetry involves attempting faithful imitation (albeit of human constructs or “categories”, not ones that are necessarily “true”), success in poetry is ultimately determined by persuasion, not truth and objectivity. For him, successful poetry is something that occurs in and of the audience, not outside and independent of it. For Mazzoni, even “poetry” is <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> category – it is our classifications that constitute criticism, not our ability to form a relationship with some reified thing called “The Poem”.|$|E
25|$|After meeting another {{character}} of the Trilogy, Jan Skrzetuski, Zagłoba, until now living <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> life of a lesser noble, trying to survive by exploiting the good faith of others, becomes drawn into the company of hero-like personas, and slowly changes, to become worthy of their trust and friendship. Together with them, Zagłoba engages in various adventures, fighting for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and seeking adventures and glory. During a feast, in a rather drunken state, {{he was the first}} to call prince Janusz Radziwiłł a traitor. Eventually he becomes a widely known person, treated with respect by powerful magnates and offering counsel to the king. He was balding and half-blind, known for his love of drinking and story-telling (usually glorifying his own exploits), tendency to poke fun at everyone and everything, later also renowned as a cunning tactician.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{philosophers}} {{of science}} argue that while causal determinism {{in which everything}} including the brain/mind {{is subject to the}} laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the brain reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been <b>a</b> <b>meaningless</b> waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.|$|E
