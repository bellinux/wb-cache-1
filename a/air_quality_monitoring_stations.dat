5000|$|The {{organization}} has used their PM2.5 data {{as a means}} of bringing attention to the health concerns associated with Hong Kong’s air pollution. For instance, their preliminary air quality monitoring showed that PM2.5 levels exceeded the recommended guidelines from the WHO. CAN also intended for their self-monitored report to act as a catalyst in encouraging the government to publish city wide PM2.5 levels in real-time. CAN believes that real time PM2.5 data is necessary, as [...] "people need to know, right now, the level of air pollution harming their health," [...] according to CAN campaign manager Erica Chan. Eventually, through politicizing and lobbying, CAN influenced the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to monitor PM2.5 levels every hour and to release the data to the public. Data is now gathered from 14 different monitoring stations, although the organization still finds the government’s actions inadequate as a majority of monitors are placed above ground level and do not accurately measure the pollutants the average person would be exposed to.

The Bay Area Air Pollution Control District {{changed its name to}} the Bay Area Air Quality Management district three years later. In 1980, the Air District proposed a [...] "Smog Check" [...] program, one that would be adopted statewide by 1982. 1989 saw the nation's first limits on emissions from commercial bakeries and marine vessel loading, and the following year, emissions from aerosol spray products also came under regulation. In 1991, the Spare the Air program was started, made to notify the public of when air quality is forecast to exceed federal standards. The Air District founded its vehicle buyback program in 1996, intended to buy and scrap older, more polluting automobiles. In 1998, the Air District began administrating the Carl Moyer Program to reduce emissions by upgrading heavy-duty diesel engines. In 1998 and 1999, the Air District took steps to reduce particulate matter, primarily through regulating woodburning appliances and monitoring particulate matter through pre-existing <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations.</b> In 2005, the Air District began to regulate emissions from refinery flares.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} industry {{is very important}} for the world economy and this industrial sector represents a substantial income source for developing countries. However, existing regulations on controlling atmospheric pollutants, and the enforcement of these regulations, often are insufficient in such countries. As a result, the deterioration of surrounding ecosystems and a quality decrease of the atmospheric environment can be observed. Previous works in this domain fail to generate executable and pragmatic solutions for inspection agencies due to practical challenges. In addressing these challenges, we introduce a so-called Chemical Plant Environment Protection Game (CPEP) to generate reasonable schedules of high-accuracy <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> (i. e., daily management plans) for inspection agencies. First, so-called Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs) in conjunction with source estimation methods are applied into this research. Second, high-accuracy <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> as well as gas sensor modules are modeled in the CPEP game. Third, simplified data analysis on the regularly discharging of chemical plants is utilized to construct the CPEP game. Finally, an illustrative case study is used to investigate the effectiveness of the CPEP game, and a realistic case study is conducted to illustrate how the models and algorithms being proposed in this paper, work in daily practice. Results show that playing a CPEP game can reduce operational costs of high-accuracy <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations.</b> Moreover, evidence suggests that playing the game leads to more compliance from the chemical plants towards the inspection agencies. Therefore, the CPEP game is able to assist the environmental protection authorities in daily management work and reduce the potential risks of gaseous pollutants dispersion incidents. </p...|$|E
