In this study, bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>spotted</b> dolphin (Stenella frontalis), and pilot whale (Globicephala sp.) populations in U.

Comparisons were made for nine whistle characteristics between northern Gulf of Mexico and western North Atlantic populations of bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales and between continental shelf and offshore populations of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>spotted</b> dolphins in the western North Atlantic. Whistle characteristics were measured for 3, 836 pilot whale whistles, 1, 703 <b>Atlantic</b> <b>spotted</b> dolphin whistles, and 2, 715 bottlenose dolphin whistles recorded between 2002 and 2004. Differences between groups were evaluated using principal components analysis and discriminant analysis. Bottlenose dolphin whistles in the Atlantic were significantly different (Hotelling 2 ̆ 7 s T-squared, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) from those in the Gulf of Mexico, differing chiefly in the whistle characteristics of end frequency, duration, and the number of inflection points.

Eleven injury categories were defined and linked to either human-related activities or natural causes. All injury categories were observed. In total, 18. 7 % of all individuals had at least one injury. Almost half (41. 7 %) of the injuries could be attributed to human interactions, of which fishing gear was the most common cause (53. 3 %) followed by propeller hits (13. 3 %). Major disfigurements were observed in all three species and could be attributed to interactions with fishing gear.
