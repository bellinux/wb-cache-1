5|$|Murray Beck {{writes that}} Macdonald's {{political}} appeal to Nova Scotians {{may have been}} even stronger than the legendary Joseph Howe's. Like Howe, Macdonald was a passionate and eloquent leader whose elegantly crafted speeches reflected his wit, wide learning and respect for factual accuracy. Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises, Macdonald became known as <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> always kept his word.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Bonnet's crew {{represented}} him {{as being}} a leader, and it appears likely that, after his rescue of Blackbeard's marooned crewmen, he became at least a co-equal commander aboard the Royal James. He {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the company's treasure, and made most major command decisions such as the direction of the ship and what vessels to attack. Most significantly, at Delaware Bay he ordered two of his crew to be flogged for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of them came, and thus only <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> commanded the obedience of his crew could successfully order such penalties.|$|E
5|$|Sung jwé, jwé chanté or chanté kont, {{is mostly}} {{part of the}} funeral wake tradition. A jwé chanté leader uses {{pantomime}} to enact scenes from a story, or sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it. The gém (game song) are based around <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics, while the audience participates in the performance. Jwé dansé includes four traditional dances. The solo is a couple dance, and the débòt, yonbòt and jwé pòté are all circle dances. The blòtjé is a musical movement found in all jwé dansé styles, occurring, for example, every four beats in the débòt dance.|$|E
25|$|For <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> was popularly {{swept into}} power in 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, Kibaki's tenure saw graft scandals where {{hundreds}} of millions of shillings were siphoned from public coffers. Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition — which took power from the authoritarian rule of Daniel arap Moi—was welcomed for its promises of change and economic growth, but soon showed that it was better suited to treading established paths.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} the result, leading Scottish Conservative {{supporter}} Paul McBride QC resigned from the party, citing that he 'frequently found himself {{at odds with the}} party in recent months', particularly with their policy on anti-sectarianism legislation and said of new party leader Ruth Davidson, that 'they have <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> has no policies and little experience apart from having been on television about as many times as I have' and that (the Scottish Conservatives) 'replaced one nice woman with one not so very nice woman'.|$|E
25|$|Many {{calls were}} made for the {{resignation}} of Tung Chee-hwa, <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> was blessed by the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin. Tung remained in the office until 10 March 2005, 20 months after the march against Article 23. Hong Kong's Basic Law permitted Tung to serve another 3 years, many suspected Beijing forced him to resign due to widespread public disapproval and his perceived lacklustre leadership. The 2005 election filled the seat with Donald Tsang who was the No. 2 ranking official, Chief Secretary, and career civil servant during British colonial rule.|$|E
25|$|India {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} that practices affirmative action on a large scale. B. R. Ambedkar, the Minister of Law in the Interim Government, and <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> drafted of the Indian constitution alone according to constitutional debate available on the government website, made provisions for reservations for Scheduled Castes (previously termed 'untouchables') in government run institutions in the 1950s. Consequently, IITs have been offering reservation for Scheduled Castes and Tribes of society since 1973. However, while a policy of quota system exists throughout the country for their reservation, a slightly different scheme is implemented in IITs, as these are Institutes of National Importance.|$|E

25|$|Slightly predating the {{chronology}} of {{the legend of}} Rurik (which dates the first Norse arrival in the region around 858–860), an earlier record for the Scandinavian settlement of the region {{is found in the}} Annales Bertiniani (written up until 882) where a Rus' delegation is mentioned as having visited Constantinople in 838 and, intending to return to the Rus' Khaganate via the Baltic Sea, were questioned by Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious at Ingelheim am Rhein, where they said that although their origin was Swedish, they had settled in Northern Rus' under <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> they designated as chacanus (the Latin form of Khagan, a title they had likely borrowed from contact with the Avars).|$|E
25|$|Jones {{joined the}} Browns {{when the team}} started play the {{following}} year in the AAFC. With the Browns, he {{was known for his}} skill in making tough short-yardage plays. He was also <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> was willing to stand up to coach Paul Brown. Jones was fifth in the AAFC in 1946 with 539 rushing yards, placing behind his teammate Marion Motley. He was also third in the league in yards per carry with seven. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year by beating the AAFC's New York Yankees, 14–9. In 1947, Jones missed five games due to injury but still led the AAFC in average yards per carry, with 6.4, as the Browns won the championship again.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Lisbon doesn't {{define a}} {{nomination}} {{process for the}} President of the Council and several official and unofficial candidates were proposed. At the final European Council meeting on the treaty in Lisbon, on 19 November 2007, French President Nicolas Sarkozy set off public speculation on candidates by naming Tony Blair, Felipe González and Jean-Claude Juncker, and praising the three as worthy candidates with Blair in particular being a long time front runner for the post. However, he faced large scale opposition for being from a large state outside the eurozone and the Schengen Area {{as well as being}} <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> entered the Iraq War which had split Europe. Minor opposition to other leaders such as Juncker also led to their rejection.|$|E

25|$|The {{municipality}} {{also has}} a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this {{is dependent on the}} actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around {{the same time as the}} People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the prehistoric}} times the main {{military}} {{force of the}} state consisted of all the grown males subject of a local Władyka. A Władyka was <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>who</b> had enough power to overwhelm previous senior tribal leaders of particular tribes, or who distinguished himself {{during the war and}} thanks to it gained hereditary sovereignty. In later times however – with more and more towns and villages – this hereditary ruler, now a duke, began to form his own drużyna. A drużyna became the basic formation of the state. However, to build an army a ruler had to send wici to call to arms a pospolite ruszenie of free landowners, who later transformed into the szlachta. The drużyna was equipped and armed by the duke, but a levy-en-masse went to war armed quite arbitrarly: weapons and armour had to be bought privately or captured in the battle. Hence the weapons of the pospolite ruszenie were quite different in origin and quality; predominately spears and javelins, war axes, bows and maces.|$|E
25|$|Users {{were able}} to {{purchase}} and form clubs. There were four clubhouse designs available to purchase – the Basic Clubhouse, the Desert Haven, nDream's War Room Clubhouse, and the Crystal Seashores Clubhouse. Each club had <b>a</b> <b>leader,</b> <b>who</b> was the user that purchased the club. The leader could elect up to 4 sub-leaders and could have up to 32 members in total, including the owner. A user could only {{be a member of}} up to five clubs, including the club that the user may have been the leader of. Though the user could own multiple clubhouse designs, they could only be the leader of one club and decided which clubhouse design would be used as the meeting place for their club. In a similar way to personal spaces, the club's owner was able to set up and decorate a private clubhouse as a meeting point for club members, and the club members could enter the clubhouse at any time. The clubhouses also featured a notice board where the leader or sub-leaders could post messages and announcements to other members. Japan's Basic Clubhouse's video screen had the option to access a Home member's page after they had entered their PSN information. Users could block other users from being a member of their club. In addition to all the standard features of the clubhouses, the War Room Clubhouse helped club owners or sub-leaders get their message across during club meetings or discussions. It also included a special access point allowing users to teleport from the War Room to other set locations.|$|E
