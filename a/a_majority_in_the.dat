5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light industrial goods. Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{chose not}} to stand for the House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election, and party leader R. B. Bennett became Prime Minister. Diefenbaker {{continued}} a high-profile legal practice, and in 1933, ran for mayor of Prince Albert. He was defeated by 48 votes in an election in which over 2,000 ballots were cast.|$|E
5|$|He entered {{politics}} upon founding the Tiako Iarivo {{political party}} in 1999 and successfully {{ran for the}} position of mayor of Antananarivo, holding the position from 1999 to 2001. As mayor he improved sanitary and security conditions in the city. In August 2001 he announced his candidacy as an independent in the December 2001 presidential election. He then took office as President in 2002 amidst a dispute over election results in which he successfully pressed his claim to have won <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round. Under the leadership of Jacques Sylla, Ravalomanana's Prime Minister from 2002 to 2007, the political party Tiako i Madagasikara (TIM) was founded in 2002 to support Ravalomanana's presidency and came to dominate legislative and local elections. He was re-elected in December 2006, again with <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round.|$|E

50|$|Republicans {{attained}} <b>an</b> elected <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 104th General Assembly (2005-2007) for {{the first}} time since Reconstruction; <b>a</b> brief <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s was the result of two outgoing senators switching parties.|$|R
25|$|Stoiber {{subsequently}} led the CSU to <b>an</b> absolute <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2003 Bavarian state elections, for <b>the</b> {{third time}} <b>in</b> a row, winning this time 60,7% {{of the votes}} and <b>a</b> two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Landtag. This was its widest margin ever achieved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|R
5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation {{that followed the}} demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, making it the largest party in parliament. Vajpayee {{was sworn in as}} Prime Minister, but was unable to attain <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lok Sabha, forcing the government to resign after 13 days.|$|E
5|$|On September 1st, Reed {{resigned}} from the Georgia Senate to run for mayor. No candidate won <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> November 3 general election, and Donzella James defeated Torrey O. Johnson in the runoff election on December 1 to replace Reed.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, {{signed on}} 10 September 1919 {{observed}} that Maribor was firmly {{under the control}} of the Yugoslav army and that, since Slovenes constituted <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region surrounding the city, Maribor should remain, with the rest of Lower Styria, within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.|$|E
50|$|Texas Republicans {{control all}} but one elected statewide offices, hold <b>a</b> 20-11 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Texas Senate, and <b>a</b> 99-51 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Texas House of Representatives. Republicans also hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats and 24 of the state's 36 U.S. House seats.|$|R
50|$|The town's {{ultimate}} {{objective is}} to create <b>an</b> Afrikaner <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern Cape, by encouraging the construction of other such towns, with the eventual goal of <b>an</b> Afrikaner <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and <b>an</b> independent Afrikaner state between Orania and the west coast, {{also known as a}} volkstaat.|$|R
25|$|Moldovans {{were the}} most {{numerous}} ethnic group, representing <b>an</b> overall <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two districts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Transnistria (Dubăsari District, 50.15%, and Grigoriopol District, 64.83%) <b>a</b> 47.82% relative <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern Camenca District, and <b>a</b> 41.52% relative <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern (Slobozia District).

5|$|The county prefects, {{city and}} {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units. If no candidate achieves <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, a runoff election is held. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms, through proportional representation with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.|$|E
5|$|The current {{president}} of Pakistan is Mamnoon Hussain of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). He {{was elected president}} on 30 July 2013, winning <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Electoral College with 432 of 702 votes, and took oath on 9 September 2013.|$|E
5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties <b>a</b> <b>majority.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Electoral College.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
50|$|All 60 {{seats of}} the Oregon House of Representatives and 16 of <b>the</b> 30 seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oregon State Senate (last contested in 2010) were up for {{re-election}} <b>in</b> 2014. <b>The</b> Democratic party held <b>a</b> 34-26 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state house and <b>a</b> 16-14 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state senate following the Oregon legislative elections of 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Liberals were re-elected with <b>a</b> {{landslide}} <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1987 provincial election, and Elston {{was returned}} by <b>a</b> significant <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> redistributed riding of Bruce. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> cabinet shuffle that followed on September 29, 1987, Elston was appointed Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet. He was also appointed Minister of Financial Institutions on August 16, 1988.|$|R
25|$|On 22 June 1870 Wood {{was given}} <b>an</b> unattached <b>majority.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1871 he paid £2,000 to {{purchase}} <b>a</b> permanent <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 90th Light Infantry, effective 28 October 1871 {{and one of}} the last such transactions before the purchase of commissions system was abolished. That cost is equivalent to around £200,000 at 2016 prices.|$|R
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Democrats won <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have {{a divided}} government, with Democrats {{controlling}} the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state {{was faced with a}} $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
50|$|The Democrats had <b>a</b> 16-14 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oregon State Senate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} session. 16 of the 30 {{senate seats}} were up for election. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Oregon House of Representatives, which was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, all 60 seats were up for election. Democrats retained their 16-14 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, and took <b>a</b> 34-26 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party. A proof of this was {{the decision of the}} Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E
5|$|From 17 December 1920 to 11 July 1921, Ramarayaningar {{served as}} the Minister of Local Self-Government in the first Justice Party {{government}} led by A. Subbarayalu Reddiar. He {{served as the}} Chief Minister of Madras Presidency from 11 July 1921 to 3 December 1926. He introduced a number of reforms during his tenure. The Theagaroya Nagar locality in Chennai was developed during his Chief-Ministership. Ramarayaningar resigned as Chief Minister in 1926 when the Justice Party failed to obtain <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1926 elections to the Madras Legislative Council. He, however, continued to remain active in politics and served as the President of the Justice Party until his death on 16 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
