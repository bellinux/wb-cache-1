5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of Asia including Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, crickets are commonly eaten as a snack, prepared by deep frying the soaked and cleaned insects. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, with an estimated production of 7,500 tons per year and United Nation's FAO has implemented a project in Laos to improve cricket farming and consequently food security. The food conversion efficiency of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E

25|$|Political party {{candidates}} were selected within party elections, or were elected by party bodies, {{and they are}} the party's sole official candidates. All parliamentary parties have a policy to support only one candidate, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> member announces an independent nomination, he or she automatically loses their party membership. Parliamentary parties that do not candidate their member for the president, usually publicly support someone. These parties can be listed on the electoral list for the president, but sometimes their support is just a public endorsement. Regional-right wing HDSSB supported independent candidate Milan Bandić, and regional-centrist PGS supported independent Nadan Vidošević.|$|E

Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be either mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders were also investigated <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.|$|E
25|$|FTL is {{the product}} of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were {{employees}} of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time. Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and seeing the Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game. They agreed they would spend a year towards development <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> efforts did not pan out, they would go on to other things. Following the success of the game, the pair began work on their second game, Into the Breach.|$|E

2500|$|The Pauli {{exclusion}} principle is the quantum mechanical principle {{which states that}} [...] two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously. In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: {{it is impossible for}} two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: n, the principal quantum number, , the angular momentum quantum number, m, the magnetic quantum number, and ms, the spin quantum number. For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> n, , and m values are the same, then their ms must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spin projections of 1/2 and −1/2. [...] This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin–statistics theorem of 1940.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Midrash, Rashi {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure," [...] to mean that God gave them the money in their merit, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>their</b> merit was insufficient, the God of their father Jacob gave it {{to them in the}} merit of their father.

Rashbam, however, read [...] to report that everyone knew that the brothers regularly benefitted from miracles. And David Kimhi (RaDaK) interpreted the steward to mean that if the brothers found the money in their sacks, it was a gift from heaven, comparable to if a human being had given them a treasure.|$|E
