25|$|He {{began his}} career in the Imperial Service as the {{commander}} of a cohort of auxiliary infantry and rose to become Praetorian Prefect, the highest office in the Imperial hierarchy, with both civilian and military functions. His brilliant career reflected his mastery of contemporary cultural norms and his reputation for administrative competence, but also his ability to access patronage at the highest level. His official life was spent mainly in fiscal postings and he typified the powerful procuratorial functionaries who came to dominate the Imperial government {{in the second quarter of}} the Third Century. Nevertheless, as Praetorian Prefect, he also seems to have proved himself more than competent in his military role. Although he was on several occasions appointed to positions that contemporary <b>Administrative</b> Law <b>reserved</b> for officials of senatorial rank, he remained an equestrian until the end: it is possible that he deliberately avoided adlection to the Roman Senate preferring to exercise real power in offices from which senators were excluded. Unlike his successor in the Praetorian Prefecture, Philip the Arab, he did not take advantage of the youth and inexperience of his Imperial master (and son-in-law), Gordian III, to seize the Empire for himself.|$|R

Dating from 1999, de-centralization laws have raised questions about administrative self-sufficiency vs. centralized control. Regardless of their contributions to regional and local self-rule, the laws have often contributed more to decentralize corruption than improve the government. Using licenses, laws, and certain authority to take away more than their fair share of local resources is reminiscent of traditional Javanese administration, as is the predominance of favoring family members (nepotism) and certain privileged groups of people.|$|R

In the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003, Congress included provisions to address a concern that housing agencies may have received more in fees than they needed to run the program. Housing agencies were directed to report to HUD their available reserves as of January 31, 2003. HUD was directed to reduce the fees agencies would receive if these levels were too high and recapture some excess fees.

40|$|International audienceThe Lacandon Forest of Chiapas, {{traditional}} {{habitat of}} the Lacandon Mayas, {{is going through}} an « esthetization » process whereby the territory turns into a global landscape. NGOs, ecotourism enterprises, as well as Mexican Government and Biosphere <b>Reserves</b> <b>administrative</b> agencies are remodeling space, setting the scenery for tourism development in order to reconcile visitors with common representations of tropical wilderness. Throughout decades of direct interaction with tourists, Lacandon Mayas have established themselves as actors of the local landscaping process, therefore ruled by two different patterns : - a naturalist model, deeply influenced by the biocultural conservation paradigm. In this framework, the uses of romantic exoticism as an aesthetic category {{are part of a}} conservation strategy for building durable landscapes within a fragile environment; - an indigenous model aimed to enhance the anthropogenic influence on nature, through metadiscourses as a cross between environmental injunctions and group’s territorial claims. This « landscape syncretism » is particularly visible in the « interpretative trails », designed to produce a genuine aesthetic experience for the visitors accompanied by Lacandon guides, who provide an immediate familiarization with the uncanny nature of the forest. Far from a simplistic indigenous/exogenous opposition, this collective process of estranging the domestic space and making the exotic seem familiar in shared landscapes reveals pragmatic and symbolic links between two opposed, though strangely similar conceptions of nature. In this paper/poster, I will develop an analysis of tourist trails in the Lacandon Maya villages, {{based on the results of}} ethnographic surveys since 2007...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur interroge la déontologie de la profession, ses moyens de mise en œuvre et ses difficultés d'application. In Quebec, only {{associations}} {{created in}} conformity with the Professional Code may use the title of professional corporation. The PC admits two types of profession: those exercising exclusive jurisdiction over their designation and their field of activity, and those exercising exclusive jurisdiction over the former but not the latter. The purpose of such corporations {{is to protect the}} public interest through their attention to the competence and professional conduct of their members. This approach to legislative policy has favoured the emergence of legislation regarding the professions the main thrust of which is professional ethics. The Corporation of Industrial Relations Counsellors (IRC) is a corporation in the second sense of the PC noted above. The law in question defines the activities of Industrial Relations Counsellors as: «the art of establishing, maintaining and changing relations between employees, between employers or between employers and employees». The present author addresses himself to the questions of professional ethics, ways of application and difficulties of enforcement. According to the terms of the PC, the professional corporation must adopt a code of ethics. The resulting code must require of the professional in question duties of both a general and a specific nature designed to cover activities, functions and inadmissible acts. The code of the IRC stipulates duties and obligations with regard to the public, the client and the profession. The concerning the public require of theCounsellor to exercise his profession with respect for human dignity. He must moreover, favour measures encouraging the quality of services through education, information and research. As regards the client, the Industrial Relations Counsellor can only accept a mandate falling within areas of his competence. Included also are specific rules dealing the quality of the professional act (integrity, availability and application), conflict of interest, confidentiality and fees. Obligations toward the profession involve the prohibition of discrimination and unbecoming behaviour. The Corporation of Industrial Relations Counsellors must see to it that the code of ethics is respected. In turn, the Corporation is responsible before the Office des professions. The Corporation exercises its role through professional inspection, disciplinary measures and arbitration. A professional inspection committee is established. This committee can take measures to disbar a member, require him to enrol in a programme to improve and update his professional knowledge, or give directives concerning the keeping of records. The disciplinary powers are of a semi-judicial nature. Each complaint is submitted to the Committee on discipline whose decisions are subject to appeal before the Tribunal des professions. In addition, a client convinced of unwarranted or excessive billing by a Counsellor can have recourse to conciliation by syndic followed by intervention of the Council for the arbitration of accounts. As in the case of all other corporation, the Corporation of Industrial Relations Councellors is confronted with people who refuse to become members or decide to withdraw, in order to avoid its controle. At the same time, they continue to exercise their profession with impunity under another professional designation than that reserved for members of the Corporation. It {{is for this reason that}} there are a great number of demands for exclusivity of practice. For the author, this solution does not seem to the most opportune, unless the working group on <b>administrative</b> tribunals <b>reserves</b> for lawyers the right of access to administrative tribunals as members or legal counsel. In this eventuality, it appears clear that the Corporation should demand a professional field shared by its members as well as those of the legal profession regarding labour courts. It should be noted that the most serious threat to the profession originates in contexts where the Counsellor, acting as a salaried employee of a firm or union occasionally ignores professional ethics because of a supposed threat to the career. For this reason, the present author suggests that the law should be modified to provide protection against the use of administrative or disciplinary measures where the professional refuses to perform acts contrary to the code of ethics (for example: prepare a biased test, declare an illegal strike, refuse to hire Corporation members, etc.). It is clear that the Corporation is required by law to subject its members to rules of competence and application. And it is in the best interests of the general public to encourage the initiative taken by the profession to further the development of a code of ethics...|$|R
