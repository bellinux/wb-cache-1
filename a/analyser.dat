It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The <b>analyser</b> which measures emissions from the incinerator plant had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E

The <b>analyser</b> had been lent to the University of Pennsylvania for the duration of the war. Using the <b>analyser</b> (invented by Vannevar Bush of MIT a decade prior and made more precise with improvements by the Moore School staff), a single trajectory computation—about 40 hours of work on a mechanical desk calculator—could be performed in about 50 minutes. Kay was further promoted to supervising calculations on the <b>analyser.</b> The <b>analyser</b> room staff worked six days a week, with their only official holidays as Christmas and the Fourth of July.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was firstly, to {{determine}} the level of agreement between the Lactate Pro and Analox GM 7 for the measurement of blood lactate, and secondly, to examine whether these <b>analysers</b> may be used interchangeably to identify lactate parameters routinely used in the physiological assessment of athletes. Twenty well-trained male cyclists performed an incremental cycle ergometry test; duplicate blood samples were taken simultaneously throughout the test for lactate determination using the two <b>analysers.</b> Power output and heart rate at LT, LT 1, 2 mmol. L- 1, and 4 mmol. L- 1 were calculated from the lactate values obtained from the two <b>analysers.</b> There was a strong linear relationship between the two <b>analysers</b> (Lactate Pro= 1. 4541 xAnalox GM 7 - 0. 1287; R 2 = 0. 969, p< 0. 001; SEE= 0. 704) though the Lactate Pro overestimated blood lactate when compared to the Analox GM 7; 95 % ratio limits of agreement (Lactate Pro/Analox GM 7) were 1. 40 x// 1. 35. Differences were found between <b>analysers</b> for power output and heart rate at LT 1 (p< 0. 01), 2 mmol. L- 1 (p< 0. 001), and 4 mmol. L- 1 (p< 0. 001); no differences were found between <b>analysers</b> for power output or heart rate at LT. In conclusion, the average difference in blood lactate concentration measured by the Lactate Pro and the Analox GM 7 was 40 %, with 95 % of measures differing by between 4 % and 89 %. This poor level of agreement and the significant differences between the two <b>analysers</b> in power output and heart rate associated with a number of lactate parameters indicate that these <b>analysers</b> should not be used interchangeably...|$|R

40|$|Abstract For {{more than}} a decade, flow cytometry-based {{automated}} haematology <b>analysers</b> have been studied for malaria diagnosis. Although current haematology <b>analysers</b> are not specifically designed to detect malaria-related abnormalities, most studies have found sensitivities that comply with WHO malaria-diagnostic guidelines, i. e. ≥ 95 % in samples with > 100 parasites/μl. Establishing a correct and early malaria diagnosis {{is a prerequisite for}} an adequate treatment and to minimizing adverse outcomes. Expert light microscopy remains the 'gold standard' for malaria diagnosis in most clinical settings. However, it requires an explicit request from clinicians and has variable accuracy. Malaria diagnosis with flow cytometry-based haematology <b>analysers</b> could become an important adjuvant diagnostic tool in the routine laboratory work-up of febrile patients in or returning from malaria-endemic regions. Haematology <b>analysers</b> so far studied for malaria diagnosis are the Cell-Dyn ®, Coulter ® GEN · S and LH 750, and the Sysmex XE- 2100 ® <b>analysers.</b> For Cell-Dyn <b>analysers,</b> abnormal depolarization events mainly in the lobularity/granularity and other scatter-plots, and various reticulocyte abnormalities have shown overall sensitivities and specificities of 49 % to 97 % and 61 % to 100 %, respectively. For the Coulter <b>analysers,</b> a 'malaria factor' using the monocyte and lymphocyte size standard deviations obtained by impedance detection has shown overall sensitivities and specificities of 82 % to 98 % and 72 % to 94 %, respectively. For the XE- 2100, abnormal patterns in the DIFF, WBC/BASO, and RET-EXT scatter-plots, and pseudoeosinophilia and other abnormal haematological variables have been described, and multivariate diagnostic models have been designed with overall sensitivities and specificities of 86 % to 97 % and 81 % to 98 %, respectively.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} <b>analyser</b> characteristics. The mass resolving {{power is the}} measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/z. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the m/z measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.|$|E

Oxygen and helium analysers are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix.

25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass <b>analyser</b> or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E
