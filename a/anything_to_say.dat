5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he {{say anything about the}} following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E

25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have {{to be careful not to}} get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

500|$|In February 2012, he {{implied that}} the UK under the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher was a more fertile ground for dissent in the arts: [...] "Under Thatcher, who ruled us with an iron rod, great art was made. Amazing {{designers}} and musicians. Acid house was born. Very colourful and progressive. Now, no one's got <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> 'Write a song? No thanks, I'll say it on Twitter'.

500|$|The jury retired at 6:15pm on {{the fifth}} day and {{returned}} at 7:30pm to give its verdict of guilty for each of the five defendants. When asked if they had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> before sentence was passed, several of the convicted men made a closing speech. Allen stated his innocence, and that he regretted the death of Sergeant Brett, but that he was prepared to [...] "die proudly and triumphantly in defence of republican principles and the liberty of an oppressed and enslaved people".|$|E

500|$|His {{attempt at}} children's comedies met {{additional}} criticism. Surf Ninjas (1993) and Mr. Magoo (1997) had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in Surf Ninjas was only [...] "an extended cameo" [...] and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers [...] "avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen {{outside of the}} Naked Gun series." [...] Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle panned Mr. Magoo, a live action remake of the 1950s cartoon, by saying, [...] "I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better but I can't think of <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> other than to make the film again." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is perhaps}} {{unlikely}} that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrate's attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts' motivations when first examined, only to do so {{at the very end}} of their trial when asked by the judge if they had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in their defence. The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been [...] "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", or even a [...] "show-trial", the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches, but also of [...] "popish plotters".|$|E
500|$|A 2002 live review quoted an {{overwhelmed}} Richards as {{telling his}} audience [...] "I don't have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> tonight, there's {{too many of}} you". Another 2002 live review, however, stated that [...] "the band seemed both at ease and happy to be back" [...] when playing one of their first post-Strange Bird concerts. dB magazines Steven Hocking, {{in a review of}} the band's 2004 Drones & Vapid Ditties live DVD, said the band are [...] "either unable or unwilling to engage the large audience", and that they were [...] "just not very visually engaging" [...] live, when compared to the sound of their albums. Performances post-Moo, You Bloody Choir have earned more positive remarks, however, as Richards has focused on improving his stage presence. David Fricke of Rolling Stone lauded an Augie March concert he saw in New York, which assisted the band in making inroads in the United States.|$|E

[...] Jessica Sager of Pop Crush rated it 0.5 out of 5 stars, {{comparing}} Furtado's vocals to the ones of a [...] "child wailing through a cardboard tube." [...] She also wrote that [...] "Sager {{also noted that the}} singer [...] "wants to depart from Loose as well, but she doesn’t have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> beyond getting dressed and having a guy ignore her" [...] and concluded that [...] "the song is more irritating than catchy, and the beat isn’t strong enough to make many people dance." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the song [...] "It’s a meaningless little ditty that is all about the military beat and bragging rights. It doesn’t have enough of a hook to work its way up the radio charts, but will likely do very well in the clubs.|$|E
500|$|A {{debate over}} whether women were {{entitled}} to a political voice had begun when many women responded to William Lloyd Garrison’s appeal to circulate antislavery petitions and sent thousands of signatures to Congress only to have them rejected, in part because women had sent them. Women abolitionists responded by holding a convention in New York City to expand their petitioning efforts, and declaring that “as certain rights and duties are common to all moral beings,” they would no longer remain within limits prescribed by “corrupt custom and a perverted application of Scripture.” After sisters Angelina and Sarah Grimke began speaking to audiences of men and women, instead of women only as was acceptable, a state convention of Congregational ministers issued a Pastoral letter condemning women’s assuming “the place of man as a public reformer” and “itinerat {{in the character of}} public lecturers and teachers.” Stone attended the convention as a spectator, and was so angered by the letter that she determined [...] "if ever [...] had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in public, [...] would say it, and all the more because of that pastoral letter." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviews of}} the film were mostly {{positive}} (receiving an 83% rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes), Mulholland Drive was not without its detractors. Rex Reed of The New York Observer {{said that it was}} the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it [...] "a load of moronic and incoherent garbage." [...] In New York, Peter Rainer observed, [...] "Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it's still a pretty moribund ride... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while." [...] In The Washington Post, Desson Howe called it [...] "an extended mood opera, if you want to put an arty label on incoherence." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety found much to praise—"Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best"—but also noted, [...] "the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland... for the final 45minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or logical connection to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from Twin Peaks and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement." [...] James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: [...] "Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us." [...] Film theorist Ray Carney notes, [...] "You wouldn't need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> You wouldn't need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls." ...|$|E
