Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today.|$|E

Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E
40|$|DE 102009036030 B 3 UPAB: 20110511 NOVELTY - The {{endoscope}} (10) has {{an image}} detection arrangement (8) sectionally {{formed as a}} flexible foil and adapted to a curved carrier surface (5). The endoscope is formed {{in such a manner}} that optical information of surrounding is detected by the image detection arrangement <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distal <b>end</b> (10 <b>a),</b> and electronic image information signal is provided <b>at</b> <b>a</b> proximal <b>end</b> (10 b). Size, shape or position of the carrier surface at the distal end is changed by a mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, electric or magnetic force effect. The image detection arrangement comprises a sensor carrier substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing an endoscope for detecting optical image information <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distal <b>end</b> and for providing electronic image information signal <b>at</b> <b>a</b> proximal <b>end.</b> USE - Endoscope for detecting optical image information <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distal <b>end</b> and for providing electronic image information signal <b>at</b> <b>a</b> proximal <b>end,</b> in <b>a</b> medical technology for minimally invasive operative interventions <b>at</b> <b>a</b> human being and an animal. Can also be used in quality-or testing technique of buildings, machines, vehicles and aircrafts, and in an industrial application for visual testing, or for testing heavily accessible cavities. ADVANTAGE - The size, shape or position of the carrier surface at the distal end is changed by the mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, electric or magnetic force effect, thus providing the endoscope with improved characteristics with respect to form adaptation to different hollow space geometries to be tested, and hence detecting images or films of heavy or accessible positions so as to obtain high quality of the images...|$|R

5|$|In {{a general}} peace conference at Sparta, the Spartans, with their {{authority}} {{enhanced by the}} threat of Persian intervention, secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to these terms. The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King's Peace, reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed. This treaty marked the first attempt at a Common Peace in Greek history; under the treaty, all cities were to be independent, a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace. Under threat of Spartan intervention, Thebes disbanded its league, and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government; Corinth, deprived of its strong ally, was incorporated back into Sparta's Peloponnesian League. After 8 years of fighting, the Corinthian war was <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E

In July 1943, Barrowclough informed the New Zealand Government that it was ready for combat duties, so in early September 1943, it moved to Guadalcanal for a combat role as part of the Solomon Islands campaign. However along the way, the troops stopped briefly at Port Vila in the New Hebrides to carry practice amphibious operations with landing craft before continuing onto Guadalcanal. Arriving off their destination on 14 September, the battalion was landed the same day. Jungle training remained the focus of the battalion although they also took the opportunity to work with Valentine tanks.|$|E

Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire. This time, he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy, while also returning 30,000 slaves to their former Roman owners—slaves who had fled to join Pompeius' army and navy. Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister tribunal immunity, or sacrosanctitas, in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome.|$|E

Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success.
