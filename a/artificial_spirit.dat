60|$|Allan {{attempted}} {{to present his}} friend in the usual form. To his astonishment, Midwinter took the words flippantly out of his lips, and introduced himself to Miss Milroy with a confident look, a hard laugh, and a clumsy assumption of ease which presented him at his worst. His <b>artificial</b> <b>spirits,</b> lashed continuously into higher and higher effervescence since the morning, were now mounting hysterically beyond his own control. He looked and spoke with that terrible freedom of license which is the necessary consequence, when a diffident man has thrown off his reserve, of the very effort by which he has broken loose from his own restraints. He involved himself in a confused medley of apologies that were not wanted, and of compliments that might have overflattered the vanity of a savage. He looked backward and forward from Miss Milroy to Allan, and declared jocosely that he understood now why his friend's morning walks were always taken in the same direction. He asked her questions about her mother, and cut short the answers she gave him by remarks on the weather. In one breath, he said she must feel the day insufferably hot, and in another he protested that he quite envied her in her cool muslin dress.|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner was}} rather gayer than {{might have been}} expected. The Doctor was jocular, Lady Annabel lively, and Plantagenet excited by an {{extraordinary}} glass of wine. Venetia alone remained dispirited. The Doctor made mock speeches and proposed toasts, and told Plantagenet that he must learn to make speeches too, or {{what would he do}} {{when he was in the}} House of Lords? And then Plantagenet tried to make a speech, and proposed Venetia's health; and then Venetia, who could not bear to hear herself praised by him on such a day, the last day, burst into tears. Her mother called her to her side and consoled her, and Plantagenet jumped up and wiped her eyes with one of those very pocket-handkerchiefs on which she had embroidered his cipher and coronet with her own beautiful hair. Towards evening Plantagenet began to experience the reaction of his <b>artificial</b> <b>spirits.</b> The Doctor had fallen into a gentle slumber, Lady Annabel had quitted the room, Venetia sat with her hand in Plantagenet's on a stool by the fireside. Both were sad and silent. At last Venetia said, 'O Plantagenet, I wish I were your real sister! Perhaps, when I see you again, you will forget this,' and she turned the jewel that was suspended round her neck, and showed him the inscription.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. 'You've over-fed him, ma'am. You've {{raised a}} <b>artificial</b> soul and <b>spirit</b> in him, ma'am unbecoming {{a person of}} his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are {{practical}} philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would never have happened.' ...|$|R

Suiseiseki speaks with the copula desu and always speaks in third person. She {{has no intention of}} participating in the Alice Game and only wishes to live happily with her twin sister, Souseiseki.

The dolls' sentient nature are powered by a magical gem called Rosa Mystica. To become Alice, a Rozen Maiden must gather all seven Rosa Mysticas; this contest {{is referred to as the}} Alice Game. Each Rozen Maiden has a production order, their own personal suitcase, and are accompanied by an <b>artificial</b> <b>spirit</b> which serves the doll. Rozen Maidens rely on a contract with a human master to supply themselves with power for battle. Since then, Rozen has forgo a physical body and lives within the N-field, waiting for Alice.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the seventh}} Rozen Maiden who is {{accompanied}} by the <b>artificial</b> <b>spirit</b> [...] She was created without a physical body as Rozen tested whether physical limitations prevented him from creating Alice. Her ability allows her to materialize illusions. Because she can not exist outside the N-Field, her main goal is to capture the Rozen Maiden's masters to ease her loneliness. After her defeat, Kirakisho uses her illusions to create a middle school student named [...] to replace Rozen and to craft imitated Rozen Maidens to be her sister. Following her second defeat, Kirakisho is touched by Shinku's love and surrenders her Rosa Mystica. She was later revived with a physical body and is in possession of the adult Jun. Kirakisho is voiced by Chiemi Chiba and English dubbed by Carli Mosier.|$|E
60|$|The Baron made up to-day, certainly, for {{the silence}} of his friend the Chevalier. He outdid himself. Story after story, {{adventure}} after adventure, followed each other with exciting haste. In fact, the Baron never ceased talking the whole dinner, except when he refreshed himself with wine, which he drank copiously. A nice observer would, perhaps, have considered the Baron's high <b>spirits</b> <b>artificial,</b> and his conversation an effort. Yet his temper, though lively, was generally equable; and his ideas, which always appeared to occur easily, were usually thrown out in fluent phraseology. The dinner was long, {{and a great deal}} of wine was drunk: more than most of the parties present for a long time had been accustomed to. About eight o'clock the Chevalier proposed going to the Redoute, but the Baron objected.|$|R
60|$|When Miriam and Donatello {{drew near}} the church, they found only Kenyon {{awaiting}} {{them on the}} steps. Hilda had likewise promised {{to be of the}} party, but had not yet appeared. Meeting the sculptor, Miriam put a force upon herself and succeeded in creating an <b>artificial</b> flow of <b>spirits,</b> which, to any but the nicest observation, was quite as effective as a natural one. She spoke sympathizingly to the sculptor on the subject of Hilda's absence, and somewhat annoyed him by alluding in Donatello's hearing to an attachment which had never been openly avowed, though perhaps plainly enough betrayed. He fancied that Miriam did not quite recognize the limits of the strictest delicacy; he {{even went so far as}} to generalize, and conclude within himself, that this deficiency is a more general failing in woman than in man, the highest refinement being a masculine attribute.|$|R
60|$|Whatever form a {{government}} may assume, its spirit must {{be determined by}} the laws which regulate the property of the country. You may have a Senate and Consuls, you may have no hereditary titles, and you may dub each householder or inhabitant a citizen; but if the spirit of your laws preserves masses of property in a particular class, the government of the country will follow the disposition of the property. So also you may have an apparent despotism without any formal popular control, and with no aristocracy, either natural or <b>artificial,</b> and the <b>spirit</b> of the government may nevertheless be republican. Thus the ancient polity of Rome, in its best days, was an aristocracy, and the government of Constantinople is the nearest approach to a democracy on a great scale, and maintained during a great period, that history offers. The constitution of France during the last half century has been fast approaching that of the Turks. The barbarous Jacobins blended modern equality with the refined civilisation of ancient France; the barbarous Ottomans blended their equality with the refined civilisation of ancient Rome. Paris secured to the Jacobins those luxuries that their system never could have produced: Byzantium served the same purpose to the Turks. Both the French and their turbaned prototypes commenced their system with popular enthusiasm, and terminated it with general subjection. Napoleon and Louis Philippe are playing the same part as the Suleimans and the Mahmouds. The Chambers are but a second-rate Divan, the Prefects but inferior Pachas: a solitary being rules alike in the Seraglio and the Tuileries, and the whole nation bows to his despotism on condition that they have no other master save himself.|$|R

She often ends her sentences with [...] and occasionally speaks in French. For battle, Hinaichigo is able to summon and control strawberry vines.

500|$|... is {{the fourth}} Rozen Maiden and is {{accompanied}} by the <b>artificial</b> <b>spirit</b> [...] She speaks in as masculine manner and has {{a strong sense of}} duty towards her master and role as a Rozen Maiden.
