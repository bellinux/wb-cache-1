40|$|Abstract. Heat runs {{of large}} {{asynchronous}} machines (AM) are hardly ever conducted under load but with synthetic approaches, {{such as the}} two-frequency method. In its classical variant, the AM’s stator is fed by two series-connected synchronous machines (SM) with different frequencies, for instance 50 and 40 Hz. While the 50 Hz voltage determines the AM’s flux, the 40 Hz source causes an AM stator current close to its rated value. Together, voltage and current yield approximately full load losses in the AM without mechanical loading. For designing the <b>amortisseurs</b> of the synchronous generators, damper losses were calculated using the Finite Element method. Additionally, calculated full load AM losses were compared against their respective values for the two-frequency method. Key word...|$|E
5000|$|The {{squirrel}} cage winding in some machines provides a damping effect for load or system disturbances, and in this role may be designated as an [...] "amortisseur" [...] windings. Large machines may only have <b>amortisseur</b> bars in the individual pole faces, not interconnected between poles. Because the {{squirrel cage}} winding is not large enough to dissipate the heat of continuous operation, large synchronous machines often have protective relays to detect when the machine has fallen out of synchronization with the supply voltage.|$|R
40|$|Series {{compensated}} {{power system}} {{may lead to}} a very unusual problem known as Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) which adversely affects the system stability and under certain operating conditions may result in fatigue breakdown of the turbine-generator shafts. The paper investigates the effects of d-axis and q-axis <b>amortisseur</b> winding parameters on the subsynchronous resonance stability zones in the series compensated power transmission system. As a case study, the power system in the state of Maharashtra (India) has been considered for investigation. An ‘all current’ mathematical model is presented for investigations. The effect of variation of damper winding parameters has been presented in the R-Xc plane...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} three-phase, synchronous phase modifier has been developed. This model has been represented as a system of six (salient-pole machine) and eight (nonsalient-pole machine) differential equations for flux-linkages and angular velocity determination. The differential equation for the flux-linkages of the stator, <b>amortisseur</b> and excitation windings have been expressed in synchronously rotational rectangular direct and quadrature coordinates. Both the rotational and transformation electromotive forces have been taken into consideration in the stator differential equations. The additional resistance for excitation current winding. The currents in both axes have been presented in matrix form. The curves of the synchronous phase modifier angular velocity; field and stator currents during induction starting have been calculated and illustrated...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the motor}} is in operation, {{the speed of}} the motor is {{dependent}} only on the supply frequency. When the motor load is increased beyond the breakdown load, the motor falls out of synchronization and the field winding no longer follows the rotating magnetic field. Since the motor cannot produce (synchronous) torque if it falls out of synchronization, practical synchronous motors have a partial or complete squirrel-cage damper (<b>amortisseur)</b> winding to stabilize operation and facilitate starting. Because this winding is smaller than that of an equivalent induction motor and can overheat on long operation, and because large slip-frequency voltages are induced in the rotor excitation winding, synchronous motor protection devices sense this condition and interrupt the power supply (out of step protection).|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of implementing a damper winding in salient-pole, synchronous generators are widely known and well consolidated. It is also {{well known that}} such a winding incurs extra losses in the machine due {{to a number of}} reasons. In order to improve the overall efficiency and performance of classical salient-pole, wound field, synchronous generators that employ the traditional damper cage, an improved <b>amortisseur</b> winding topology that reduces the inherent loss is proposed and investigated in this paper. This is essential in order to meet modern power quality requirements and to improve the overall performance of such ’classical’ machines. The new topology addresses the requirements for lower loss components without compromising the acceptable values of the output voltage total harmonic distortion and achieves this by having a modulated damper bar pitch. As vessel for studying the proposed concept, a 4 MVA, salient-pole, synchronous generator is considered. A finite element model of this machine is first built and then validated against experimental results. The validated model is then used to investigate the proposed concept with an optimal solution being achieved via the implementation of a genetic algorithm optimization tool. Finally, the performance of the optimised machine is compared to the original design both at steady state and transient operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} application of negative-phase-sequence arc suppressor to power transmission system in the laboratory {{for the purpose of}} the suppression of fault currents. 　The device is a non-salient pole synchronous machine without <b>amortisseur</b> winding, having two-phase field windings connected with variable condensers. 　Testing machine is made as generator of this type, rated 50 Hz, 220 V, 3 kVA and drived by a synchronous motor. 　The characteristic of the negative-phase-sequence impedance to inserted field capacitance is obtained from measurement of phase-to-phase dead short fault occured at armature terminals of the unloaded generator. 　The machine is applied to 200 V power transmission system in the laboratory as generator or synchronous phase modifier and its neutral is directly grounded. 　A line-to-ground fault or a line-to-line short fault is occurred at the middle point of the transmission line in the system and measurement is made for thc steady-state quantities such as the current flowing into the fault branch, symmetrical components of the line currents, line-voltages and the voltages induced in the field windings. 　The results are shown from the measurements and numerical calculations as follows. 　 1) The negative-phase-sequence impedance of the machine is varied over the range 0. 7 to 10 times the positive-phase-sequence impedance. 　 2) The operation of the system during the fault is changed according to the compensation of negative-phase-sequence network for the system. In particular, the current flowing into the fault can be reduced to 20 % of that not compensated, when the series resonance is achieved by the device in the negative-phase-sequence network. 　 3) The voltage induced in the field winding of the device may be larger than the line-voltage before the faults...|$|R

The developed model has been linearised analytically, to obtain the respective small-signal model. The eigenvalue analysis of the modelled systems has indicated that most of the SM system eigenvalues (modes) are slower or not as well damped as the VSM system ones. Moreover, most SM system modes have shown to be relatively fixed and determined mainly by non-tunable parameters. The modelled exciter has presented little capability of increasing the damping of oscillations, and its integral gain has demonstrated to be the tunable parameter that can most easily cause instability in the SM system. The location of the 4 slowest and least damped SM system eigenvalues has shown to be limited by non-tunable parameters, indicating that the performance or robustness of such system cannot be significantly improved. A trade-off has been observed in the placement of the VSM system critical modes: increasing the virtual impedance improves the damping of oscillations, while making the system response slower. However, parametric sweep analysis has indicated that a good compromise between performance and robustness could be achieved by decreasing the virtual impedance and increasing the phase lock loop proportional gain...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 92 The {{design of}} a 66, 000 hp {{electric}} motor to drive an air compressor presented significant design challenges. Using conventional assumptions in assessing the bearing support and foundation stiffness yielded a scenario {{where it would be}} impractical to achieve a 20 percent separation margin between operating speed and the lateral critical speeds of the motor. Structural stiffnesses well above conventional values were required in order to achieve the specified separation margin. Finite element studies were performed on the bearing pedestals and motor base. As a result of the studies, it was deemed necessary to perform a modal finite element study on the complete motor assembly. Eventually, it was decided that a modal analysis would be performed on the entire drive train (motor, gear, compressor, and foundation). These studies confirmed that the structural stiffness needed was achievable. Factory and field tests substantiated the analysis. Another challenge in this design was the ability of the motor to accelerate a drive train with a polar inertia in excess of 355, 000 lb? -ft^ 2. The rotor construction is such {{that there is not a}} discrete <b>amortisseur.</b> On startup, currents are induced in the rotor pole face, which lead to significant heating. Surface temperatures in excess of 400 ?C (750 ?F) were calculated. Plastic deformation of the rotor pole face will occur at this temperature due to large thermal strains. Consistency of the shaft forging mechanical properties is paramount if shaft bending is to be avoided. A stringent forging specification was written, which limited the number of forging suppliers who could meet the requirements. Finite element studies were performed to calculate the stresses and plastic strains. High temperature mechanical testing was performed on the forging material to confirm that the stress-strain hysteresis loop would close after repeated cycling. Furthermore, care needed to be taken to ensure that the rotor winding and insulation system was protected from damaging temperatures. Once again, factory and field test confirmed the analytical work...|$|R
