500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't even know what we're fighting for / Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield." [...] Its bridge features the line: [...] "I guess you'd better go <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> armour".|$|E
500|$|Side B {{begins with}} [...] "Baby, I Love You". Johnny {{constantly}} claims {{in his book}} Commando that he hated the song and the band didn't even play on it, only Joey and some studio musicians. Joey exclaimed that he [...] "hated" [...] the song, despite it obtaining a level of popularity in Europe. The song is a cover version of the original by The Ronettes, and contained a string section arrangement that Leigh deemed [...] "gooey" [...] and that it [...] "sounded right out of Redbone's 'Come <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Your</b> Love.'" [...] He also confessed that the song [...] "almost made [...] embarrassed." [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School" [...] originally appeared on the soundtrack to Rock 'n' Roll High School, a film directed by Allan Arkush. The movie depicts a story line in which the Ramones are obsessed over by female high school student Riff Randell along with other pupils attending the school. The album concludes with [...] "High Risk Insurance", which is a reaction to politics of that era.|$|E

500|$|When {{choosing}} the songs, Gunn revealed he [...] "started {{the process by}} reading the Billboard charts {{for all of the}} top hits of the '70s", downloading [...] "a few hundred" [...] songs that were [...] "semi-familiar — ones you recognize but {{might not be able to}} name off the top of your head" [...] and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he [...] "would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house — sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best." [...] Most of the songs were played on set to help [...] "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with David Bowie's [...] "Moonage Daydream" [...] the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with [...] "Hooked on a Feeling" [...] in mind; however once Gunn discovered [...] "Come <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Your</b> Love", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a [...] "better fit." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly {{described}} [...] "Battlefield" [...] as [...] "gorgeous", writing, [...] "when Sparks hits that 'Better go <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> armor' bridge, you can practically {{feel the}} wind whipping through your hair." [...] Johnny Dee of Virgin Media wrote {{that it was}} one of the song's [...] "you cannot help but reach for any available nearby hairbrush and sing along to", despite calling the bridge a [...] "clunking pedestrian pace and corny advice". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated that [...] "Battlefield" [...] is as catchy as [...] "Halo" [...] and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007), and noted that the song's production was similar to Pat Benatar's [...] "We Belong" [...] (1984). This was echoed by Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, who wrote that [...] "there's an inner Pat Benatar struggling to get out." [...] Nate Chinen of The New York Times stated that on [...] "Battlefield", Sparks' [...] "sounds vexed but in control, and undaunted by the copyright interests of Pat Benatar, who preferred her battlefield metaphors in declarative form", referring to Benatar's [...] "Love Is a Battlefield" [...] (1983). Joanna Hunkin of The New Zealand Herald noted that the song's lyrics were similar to Benatar's [...] "Love Is a Battlefield", and criticized Sparks for plagiarism and not crediting Benatar as an inspiration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{record was}} {{originally}} announced to be titled Heidi Montag, later Independent, and eventually The One. In 2009, Montag {{stated that the}} record would be titled Superficial, commenting that [...] "that's the world [...] in and how people think [...] but it's really just the surface". Its intended cover was shot by Liz Ciganovich, who commented that it was inspired by Montag's earlier music video for her song [...] "Overdosin'" [...] and [...] "Physical" [...] by Olivia Newton-John. It depicted Montag dressed in a strapless, polka-dotted leotard {{in front of a}} wall of cassettes, which she described as a [...] "shout out to the '80s" [...] and [...] "makes you remember when you just had to run out to the record store <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> favorite album".

2500|$|In July, 1864, the 15th Arkansas was field {{consolidated}} {{with the}} Fagan's 1st Arkansas Infantry. During the Battle of Kennesay Mountain the 1st/15th {{became involved in}} a famous humanitarian act. At {{one point in the}} battle on June 27, not far from the position known as the [...] "Dead Angle", the Union frontal assault had failed leaving hundreds of dead and wounded Union soldiers between the Confederate works and the Union lines. The woods and brush between the two armies caught fire because of the gun fire and artillery. The fire began to creep toward the wounded soldiers. Lt. Colonel William P. Martin who was commanding the 1st and 15th combined Arkansas Regiments, jumped on the earthworks and ordered his Confederate soldiers to cease firing. He then waved a white flag of truce yelling to the Union soldiers to [...] "come <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> wounded, they are burning to death." [...] For a short time the Union and Confederate soldiers helped remove the wounded and put out the fires. The next day the Union generals presented Martin with two Colt Revolvers as a thank you for his humanitarian efforts. Later the opposing forces began to fire at each other again.|$|E
