Type metal, an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking.

25|$|The casting {{material}} is an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> (85%), antimony (11%), and tin (4%), and produces a one-piece casting slug capable of 300,000impressions before the casting begins to develop deformities and imperfections, {{and the type}} must be cast again.|$|E
25|$|Bismuth {{significantly}} {{lowers the}} melting point and improves wettability. In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses {{along the grain}} boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> can therefore desolder under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking. Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which {{may be used to}} offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of tin whiskers. Relatively expensive, limited availability.|$|E

25|$|Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg {{introduced}} the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type {{based on a}} matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, {{the use of an}} oil-based ink, {{and the creation of a}} softer and more absorbent paper. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> tin, antimony, copper and bismuth – the same components still used today. Johannes Gutenberg started work on his printing press around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} {{worked as a}} professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He {{was the first to}} make type from an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions, a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Gutenberg is also {{credited}} {{with the introduction of}} an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He also the first to make his type from an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> tin, and antimony, known as type metal, printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.|$|E
25|$|Lead, and to {{some degree}} tin, as used in solder {{contains}} small but significant amounts of radioisotope impurities. Radioisotopes undergoing alpha decay are a concern due to their tendency to cause soft errors. Polonium-210 is especially problematic; lead-210 beta decays to bismuth-210 which then beta decays to polonium-210, an intense emitter of alpha particles. Uranium-238 and thorium-232 are other significant contaminants <b>of</b> <b>alloys</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|R
50|$|The largest {{applications}} for metallic antimony is an alloy with {{lead and tin}} and the lead antimony plates in lead-acid batteries. <b>Alloys</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> and tin with antimony have improved properties for solders, bullets, and plain bearings. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application {{is the use of}} antimony in microelectronics.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{metallic}} arsenic is in <b>alloys</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> (for example, in car batteries and ammunition). Arsenic {{is a common}} n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices, and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide {{is the second most}} commonly used semiconductor after doped silicon. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications are declining, however.|$|R
2500|$|Annealing brass {{to make it}} softer {{and less}} brittle is fairly easy, but {{annealing}} cartridge cases is a more complex matter. Since {{the base of the}} case must be hard, it cannot be annealed. What is needed is a form of heat treatment called differential hardening, where heat is carefully applied to part of the case until the desired softness is reached, and then the heat treatment process is halted by rapidly cooling the case. [...] Since annealing brass requires heating it to about 660°F (350°C), the heating must be done {{in such a way as}} to heat the neck to that temperature, while preventing the base of the case from being heated and losing its hardness. The traditional way is to stand the cases in a shallow pan full of water, then heat the necks of the cases with a torch, but this method makes it difficult to get an even heating of the entire case neck. A temperature-sensitive crayon can be used at the point to which it is to be annealed, which is just behind the shoulder for bottlenecked cartridges, or at the bottom of the bullet seating depth for straight-wall cartridges. The neck of the case is placed in a propane torch flame and heated it until the crayon mark changes color, indicating the correct temperature. Once the correct temperature is reached the case is completely quenched in water to stop the annealing process at the desired hardness. [...] Failing to keep the base of the case cool can anneal the case near the head, where it must remain hard to function properly. [...] Another approach is to immerse the case mouth in a molten <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> that is at the desired annealing temperature for a few seconds, then quickly shake off the lead and quench the case.|$|E

He did remarkable work with light alloys, on the mechanism of crystallisation, the mechanical deformation of metals, and the improvement of technical practice. His many papers were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, the Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute, and other technical journals. With P. A.

25|$|For {{electrical}} and electronics work, solder wire {{is available in}} a range of thicknesses for hand-soldering, and with cores containing flux.

50|$|Lead tin telluride, also {{referred}} to as PbSnTe or Pb1−xSnxTe, is a ternary <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> tin and tellurium, generally made by alloying either tin into lead telluride or lead into tin telluride. It is a IV-VI narrow band gap semiconductor material.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. <b>Alloys</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|R

50|$|Terne {{plate is}} a form of tinplate: a thin steel sheet coated with an <b>alloy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> and tin. The terne alloy was in the ratio of 10-20% tin and the {{remainder}} lead. The low tin content made it cheaper than other tinplates.|$|E
