5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1998 {{to improve the}} bridge over the Schuylkill River in Montgomery County. The work {{involved}} building a new bridge adjacent to the existing bridge; the new bridge was wide enough to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> future widening to six lanes. This project was completed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Ham Street, Appledore and Rye have {{staggered}} platforms: passengers {{cross the}} line {{from the end of}} one platform {{to the end of the}} other.

5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin {{engine and}} contra-rotating propellers.

5|$|Pilgrims {{attempt to}} visit the {{confines}} of the area, for there is a tradition that supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected.

5|$|The circuit was resurfaced {{ahead of}} the race weekend, {{smoothing}} out many of the bumps and imperfections that had developed over time.

5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting the tempo and character of the music within movements very quickly to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> new musical idea with each successive phrase of text.|$|E
5|$|Woodside {{railway station}} {{was built in}} 1871 to serve Croydon Racecourse (see below). The station was unusual in being {{designed}} for horses, with access ramps instead of steps and with unusually high entrances designed to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> horse and rider. In 1997 the railway was replaced by Tramlink; the station is now Woodside tram stop.|$|E
5|$|Abe refines this {{proof-of-concept}} {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours {{into his own}} past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} March 2012, {{information}} was leaked hinting {{at a new}} series of Zenbooks and in early May Asus revealed the UX32 series, followed by their release on May 21. Two models were announced: the UX32A and the UX32VD, both including a thicker chassis to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> 500GB/24GB flash hybrid drive and in the UX32VD an Nvidia Geforce GT 620M. The UX32A was designed to be a cheaper Zenbook with a previous generation Sandy Bridge processor option, lower resolution screen and hybrid drive.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E

5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century {{some changes}} to Conwy's town walls {{were made in}} order to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> new railway line and roads. The {{engineer}} Thomas Telford built two new gateways into the walls in 1826 to accommodate the traffic from the new suspension bridge across the river Conwy. In 1848 Robert Stephenson constructed the Chester to Holyhead railway line, which ran through Conwy; unusually for the period, {{attempts were made to}} sensitively protect the appearance of the medieval fortifications and the entrance for the railway through the walls {{on the south side of}} the town was built in the form of a mock-Gothic archway, while an exit tunnel was dug under the western walls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E

E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> dorsal surveillance radar system, engine nacelle alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|Expansion to {{the north}} end that cost $2million and added 1,249 seats was {{completed}} {{for the start of}} the 2010 MLS Season. A$120million renovation to the stadium was officially announced September 23, 2014. It includes a second tier of seating that would add 8,400 seats, raising the capacity of the stadium to 30,991. New suites, washrooms, concourse and a roof would also be added. Construction began in September 2014 and would be divided into two phases, with the completion of the project set for May 2016. The expansion would <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> Canadian football field with artificial turf end-zones when the Toronto Argonauts move to BMO Field in 2016, along with hosting the Grey Cup that year.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> few {{individuals}} standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E
