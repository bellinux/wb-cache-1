50|$|Dissolved <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> {{has a lower}} {{tendency}} of retrogradation (gelling) during storage and cooling. For this main reason, the waxy starches are used in different applications mainly as a thickening agent or stabilizer.|$|E
50|$|Several {{years earlier}} Robert P. Bear had {{discovered}} {{and reported that}} waxy corn (100% <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch)</b> also occurred as a mutation. Once discovered and reported, waxy mutations {{were found in the}} order of once every 30,000 observations.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{modification}} of starches can reduce or enhance the retrogradation. Waxy, high <b>amylopectin,</b> <b>starches</b> {{also have a}} much lesser tendency to retrogradate. Additives such as fat, glucose, sodium nitrate and emulsifier can reduce retrogradation of starch.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to strong}} {{associations}} of hydrogen bonding, longer amylose molecules will form a stiff gel. Amylopectin molecules with longer branched structure, increases {{the tendency to}} form strong gels. Granule size do not directly impact starch performance, {{but it is one}} of the main factors affecting starch gelatinization and retrogradation. High <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starches</b> will have a stable gel, but will be softer than high amylose gels.|$|R
50|$|Starch is a glucose polymer {{in which}} glucopyranose units are bonded by alpha-linkages. It {{is made up}} of a mixture of amylose (15-20%) and {{amylopectin}} (80-85%). Amylose consists of a linear chain of several hundred glucose molecules and Amylopectin is a branched molecule made of several thousand glucose units (every chain of 24-30 glucose units is one unit of <b>Amylopectin).</b> <b>Starches</b> are insoluble in water. They can be digested by breaking the alpha-linkages (glycosidic bonds). Both humans and animals have amylases, so they can digest starches. Potato, rice, wheat, and maize are major sources of starch in the human diet. The formations of starches are the ways that plants store glucose.|$|R
5000|$|Amflora (also {{known as}} EH92-527-1) is a genetically {{modified}} potato cultivar developed by BASF Plant Science. [...] "Amflora" [...] potato plants produce pure <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> that is processed to waxy potato starch. It was approved for industrial {{applications in the}} European Union on 2 March 2010 by the European Commission. In January 2012, the potato was withdrawn from {{the market in the}} EU.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cultivated}} plant varieties have pure <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> without amylose, known as waxy starches. The most used is waxy maize, others are glutinous rice and waxy potato starch. Waxy starches have less retrogradation, {{resulting in a}} more stable paste. High amylose starch, amylomaize, is cultivated {{for the use of}} its gel strength and for use as a resistant starch (a starch that resists digestion) in food products.|$|E
5000|$|... ''''Amflora'''' (also {{known as}} EH92-527-1) was a {{cultivar}} developed by BASF Plant Science for production of pure <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> for processing into waxy potato starch. It was approved for industrial {{applications in the}} European Union market on 2 March 2010 by the European Commission, but was withdrawn from the EU market in January 2012 {{due to a lack}} of acceptance from farmers and consumers.|$|E
40|$|Previous trials here {{indicated}} a possible difference in nutritional values of different hybrid sorghum grains with yellow endosperm hybrids being superior to white endosperm. We compared feedlot performance of yellow endosperm, white endosperm, all waxy (<b>amylopectin</b> type <b>starch),</b> and part waxy hybrid sorghum grains...|$|R
50|$|Values {{used on the}} iodine binding, however, {{are only}} {{estimates}} of amylose content because of differences in the binding abilities (and structure) of amylose and <b>amylopectin</b> among <b>starch</b> types. For example, amylopectin molecules with long external branches bind more iodine than those with short branches do, resulting in a small measure of apparent amylose.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of carbohydrates: polysaccharides (e.g., <b>starch,</b> <b>amylopectin,</b> glycogen, cellulose), monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, galactose, fructose, ribose) and the disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, maltose, lactose).|$|R
50|$|Due to the waxy gene being recessive, {{waxy maize}} {{has to be}} {{isolated}} from any nearby dent maize fields by at least 200 meters to prevent cross-pollination. Volunteer dent maize plants sprouting from the previous year's debris are also a problem. A few dent maize volunteers in a waxy field {{will be enough to}} contaminate the whole field, resulting in dent grains instead of waxy grains with <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Amflora, {{a potato}} {{developed}} initially for the European market, producing pure <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> for industrial use. Waxy potato starch {{is used in}} industrial procedures to make yarn stronger and paper glossier; it also makes spray concrete adhere better to walls. Due to lack of acceptance of GM crops in Europe BASF Plant Science decided in 2012 the stop of its commercialization and research activities on the European potato varieties Amflora and Fortuna. Further it announced the relocation of the corporate headquarters from Germany to the USA.|$|E
5000|$|Modified {{waxy maize}} {{starches}} {{are used for}} the improvement of uniformity, stability, and texture in various food products. The clarity and viscous stability of <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> make it especially suitable for thickening fruit pies. It improves smoothness and creaminess of canned food and dairy products as well as freeze-thaw stability of frozen foods. It gives a more desirable texture and appearance to dry foods and mixes 24. Waxy maize starch is also the preferred starting material for the production of maltodextrins because of improved water solubility after drying and greater solution stability and clarity.|$|E
40|$|Polymer blends of {{cold water}} soluble <b>starches</b> (amylose or <b>amylopectin</b> soluble <b>starch)</b> with gela-tin were {{prepared}} using solvent casting method. The solid state miscibility and polymer-polymer interactions between the constituent polymers were studied by fourier transforms infrared spec-troscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorirmetry (DSC), light optical mi-croscopy (OP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), whereas the thermal stability of the blends was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Furthermore, tensile and water vapor barrier properties of the blends were assessed. The obtained results exhibited that gelatin was more miscible with amylose soluble <b>starch</b> than with <b>amylopectin</b> soluble <b>starch.</b> Moreover, en-hancing mechanical and water barrier properties of amylose soluble starch/gelatin blends were more pronounced than those of amylopectin soluble starch/gelatin blends. Generally, tensile strength (TS) and Elongation percentage (E) of the blend films {{were found to be}} gradually increas-ed with increasing the proportion of gelatin. Nevertheless, increasing starch proportion was i...|$|R
50|$|Amylases are the {{enzymes that}} hydrolyses {{and reduce the}} {{molecular}} weight of amylose and <b>amylopectin</b> molecules in <b>starch,</b> rendering it water-soluble enough to be washed off the fabric.|$|R
50|$|The {{parotid gland}} also secretes salivary {{alpha-amylase}} (sAA), {{which is the}} first step in the decomposition of starches during mastication. It is the main exocrine gland to secrete this. It breaks down amylose (straight chain <b>starch)</b> and <b>amylopectin</b> (branched <b>starch)</b> by hydrolyzing alpha 1,4 bonds. Additionally, the alpha amylase has been suggested to prevent bacterial attachment to oral surfaces and to enable bacterial clearance from the mouth.|$|R
50|$|Arborio rice is an Italian short-grain rice. It {{is named}} after the town of Arborio, in the Po Valley, which is {{situated}} in the main growing region. Arborio is also grown in Arkansas, California, and Missouri in the United States. When cooked, the rounded grains are firm, and creamy and chewy compared to other rices, due to their higher <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> content. It has a starchy taste and blends well with other flavours. Arborio rice {{is often used to}} make risotto; other suitable varieties include Carnaroli, Maratelli, Baldo, and Vialone Nano. Arborio rice is also used for rice pudding.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of added unmodified <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> and modified <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> on {{the stability of}} oil-in-water emulsions (4 wt % corn oil), formed with a highly hydrolyzed commercial whey protein (WPH) product, during retort treatment (121 °C for 16 min), was examined. The creaming, coalescence, and flocculation of the emulsions were studied by determining changes in the droplet size and the microstructure of the emulsions after retorting. At a low starch concentration (1. 5 %), the extent of coalescence was higher in the emulsions containing modified <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> than in those containing unmodified <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch.</b> All emulsions containing moderate levels of unmodified or modified <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> showed flocculation of oil droplets by a depletion mechanism. The degree of flocculation, which was dependent on the molecular weight and the radius of gyration of the amylopectin molecules, was considered to correlate with the extent of coales-cence of the oil droplets in these emulsions. At high levels of added starch (> 1. 5 %), the degree of coalescence decreased gradually, apparently {{because of the high}} viscosity of the aqueous phase...|$|E
40|$|Amylolytic enzyme was {{purified}} to electrophoretically homogeneous {{state from}} culture broth of Aspergillus oryzae MIBA 316. This enzyme hydrolyzed preferentially <b>amylopectin,</b> <b>starch</b> and glycogen. Approaches to complete breakdown of starch to its components and their utilization in food processing were discussed...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that {{a certain amount of}} ingested starch can escape digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble <b>starch,</b> gelatinized <b>amylopectin</b> maize <b>starch,</b> and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of <b>amylopectin</b> maize <b>starch</b> and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958 N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized <b>amylopectin</b> maize <b>starch,</b> while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40 % of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (Mr) weights (> 160, 000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (> 66, 000), and low relative molecular weights (< 66, 000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch...|$|R
30|$|Several enzymes are {{involved}} in starch biosynthesis. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPP) catalyzes the first reaction in starch synthesis, producing the activated glucosyl donor ADP-glucose (James et al. 2003). Granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) is involved in amylose synthesis. Soluble starch synthase (SSS) catalyses the elongation of <b>amylopectin</b> chains. <b>Starch</b> branching enzyme (SBE) introduces branch points into the amylopectin chains. The precise mechanism that controls starch biosynthesis in grain is complex and not well understood.|$|R
40|$|Starches and celluloses can be {{chemically}} modified {{in order to}} affect their physiochemical properties. Modification of these carbohydrate polymers entails derivatising their free hydroxyl groups with functional groups. Which properties are obtained depends {{on the nature of}} the functional groups as well as on how they are distributed throughout the polymeric structure of the carbohydrate. Unfortunately, the correlation between the distribution of modifications and the obtained properties is not fully understood. In order to facilitate the investigation of this correlation, new analytical tools are needed. Starch and cellulose are too large to be analysed by most conventional analysis techniques. In this thesis this problem was remedied by using hydrolysis (either acid hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis) to form smaller molecules that are more easily analysed. The hydrolysates were then analysed by ESI-MS. LC-MS, HPAEC-PAD, SEC-RI and reducing-end determination were employed as well. Four modified polysaccharides were investigated: two modified <b>starches</b> (hydroxypropylated <b>amylopectin</b> potato <b>starch</b> and cationic <b>amylopectin</b> potato <b>starch)</b> and two modified celluloses (carboxymethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose). The information obtained on the hydrolysates could be utilised both in understanding the distribution of modifications in investigated compounds and in understanding of the function of the employed enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Isolation {{method is}} {{modification}} method of substances separation based on differences in solubility for amylose and <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> with {{high degree of}} purity. In general, this study aims to isolate the amylose and amylopectin from potato starch. Specifically, this study aims {{to determine the effect}} of pH, methods, and the ratio of volume to the percentage of amylose and amylopectin produced. Amylose is an unbranched polymer which, together with <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> into constituent components. The products of potato starch is used for concentrating liquid food, adhesive component, a mixture of paper and textiles, and in the cosmetics industry. Starch with amylose content used for the manufacture of biodegradable films and tablets, while amylopectin is used for the manufacture of bread, cakes, and {{can be used as a}} diet. The experiments were conducted by mixing potato starch solution, complexing solution into a bekker glass with fixed variable potato starch 40 grams, drying temperature 70 °C, while the changed variable are the ratio between the volume of an aqueous suspension of potato starch complexing solution and 2 : 1, 2 : 2, 2 : 3, pH 4. 5, 5. 5, 6. 5, and the method used are salting out and complexing agent. The results showed that the pH of mixed solution is the most influential variable. Optimum conditions obtained by the method of salting out with a pH of 6. 5 and the ratio of the volume of an aqueous suspension of starch and complexing solution is 2 : 3, with the acquisition of 97, 97 % amylose starch and 98, 692 % <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch...</b>|$|E
40|$|The rising {{prevalence}} of obesity and {{the vulnerability of the}} pediatric age group have highlighted the critical need for a careful consideration of effective, safe, remedial and preventive dietary interventions.   Amylose starch (RS 2) from high-amylose maize (HAM) ferments in the gut and affects body weight.    One hundred and ten children, of 7 - 8 (n= 91) or 13 - 14 (n= 19) years of age scored the sensory qualities of a yogurt supplemented with either HAM-RS 2 or an <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch.</b>   The <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> yogurt was preferred to the HAM-RS 2 -enriched yogurt by 7 - 8 year old panelists (P< 0. 0001).  Appearance, taste, and sandiness scores given by 13 - to 14 -year-old panelists were more favorable for the <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> yogurt than for HAM-RS 2 -enriched yogurt (P< 0. 05).  HAM-RS 2 supplementation resulted in acceptable (≥ 6 on a 1 - 9 scale) sensory and hedonic ratings of the yogurt in 74 % of subjects.   Four children consumed a HAM-RS 2 -enriched yogurt for four weeks to test its fermentability in a clinical trial.   Three adolescents, but not the single pre-pubertal child, had reduced stool pH (P= 0. 1) and increased stool short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (P< 0. 05) including increased fecal acetate (P= 0. 02), and butyrate (P= 0. 089) from resistant starch (RS) fermentation and isobutyrate (P= 0. 01) from protein fermentation post-treatment suggesting a favorable change to the gut microbiota.  HAM-RS 2 was not modified by pasteurization of the yogurt, and may be a palatable way to increase fiber intake and stimulate colonic fermentation in adolescents.   Future studies are planned to determine the concentration of HAM-RS 2 that offers the optimal safe and effective strategy to prevent excessive fat gain in children...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} whereby amyloplasts from immature barley (Hordeum distichum L.) endosperm could be separated into two populations of {{large and small}} amyloplasts at all stages of development. The small amyloplasts had more amylopectin than the large at early stages, but by 60 days after anthesis, the large had the greater proportion of <b>amylopectin.</b> <b>Starch</b> synthetase activity was associated with both types of amyloplast. The nucleotide specificity of the starch synthetase associated with each population varied independently throughout development. At 25 days after anthesis, the large amyloplasts were more susceptible than the small to α-amylolysis; however, at 38 and 60 days, the small amyloplasts became more susceptible...|$|E
5000|$|Mochi is a {{multicomponent}} food {{consisting of}} polysaccharides, lipids, protein and water. Mochi has a heterogeneous structure of <b>amylopectin</b> gel, <b>starch</b> grains, and air bubbles. [...] This rice {{is characterized by}} its lack of amylose in the starch and is derived from short or medium japonica rices. The protein concentration of the rice is {{higher than that of}} normal short-grain rice, and the two also differ in amylose content. In mochi rice, the amylose content is negligible, which results in its gel-like consistency.|$|R
30|$|Significant {{differences}} in amylose, <b>amylopectin</b> and total <b>starch</b> {{contents of the}} rhizome were observed among the 15 lotus cultivars. The ranges in amylose, <b>amylopectin</b> and total <b>starch</b> contents observed were 1.86 – 6.32  %, 9.7 – 14.51  % and 13.17 – 18.85  %, respectively. The contents of amylose (11.53  %) and total starch (18.85  %) for ‘Mei Ren Hong’ {{were significantly higher than}} those of the other cultivars analyzed, and the lowest total starch content was recorded for ‘Su Zhou’ (13.17  %). The amylose and amylopectin contents (1.86 and 9.70  %) of ‘XSBZ’ and ‘Zhen Zhu’, respectively, were the lowest observed among the cultivars analyzed (Table  1). Therefore, ‘Mei Ren Hong’ was selected to quantify AGPase activity and for gene expression profile analysis.|$|R
40|$|Carbon isotope ratios (expressed as δ 13 C values) were {{determined}} for various sources of starch and the starch fractions amylose and amylopectin. The δ 13 C values of amylose were consistently less negative, 0. 4 – 2. 3 ‰, {{than those of}} <b>amylopectin</b> in kernal <b>starch</b> from maize (Zea mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) and in tuber starch from potato (Solanum tuberosum). Kernel starch isolated from the maize mutants wx 1 and ae 1, with known genetic lesions in the starch biosynthetic pathway, also showed significant differences in δ 13 C values. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} variation in carbon isotope ratios in the amylose and <b>amylopectin</b> components of <b>starch</b> may be attributed to isotopic discrimination by the enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCarbon {{particles}} are synthesized under hydrothermal conditions using different biomass (glucose, xylose, maltose, sucrose, <b>amylopectin,</b> <b>starch)</b> and biomass derivates (5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural- 1 -aldehyde (HMF) and furfural) as carbon sources. Carbons obtained from mono- and polysaccharides, hexose and pentose sugars, {{and from the}} biomass derivatives, HMF and furfural, are compared from the particle morphology, chemical composition and structural point of view. A clear structural and morphological difference {{can be observed in}} carbons from pentoses and hexoses, but in the latter case, irrespective {{of the nature of the}} hexose sugar, all carbon materials showed astonishing similarities, opening the way for the use of renewable biomass in the synthesis of such carbon materials...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} effects of {{different}} starch types on {{the properties of}} biodegradable polymer based on thermoplastic starch (TPS) were investigated. Different types of starch containing different contents of amylose and amylopectin were used, i. e. cassava starch, mungbean starch, and arrowroot starch. The TPS polymers were compounded and shaped using an internal mixer and an injection molding machine, respectively. It {{was found that the}} amount of amylose and amylopectin contents on native starch influence the properties of the TPS polymer. A high amylose starch of TPMS led to higher strength, hardness, degree of crystallization than the high <b>amylopectin</b> <b>starch</b> of TPCS. In addition, function group analysis by Fourier transforms infrared spectrophotometer, water absorption, and biodegradation by soil burial test were also examined...|$|E
50|$|Plants produce starch {{by first}} {{converting}} glucose 1-phosphate to ADP-glucose using the enzyme glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. This step requires {{energy in the}} form of ATP. The enzyme starch synthase then adds the ADP-glucose via a 1,4-alpha glycosidic bond to a growing chain of glucose residues, liberating ADP and creating amylose. Starch branching enzyme introduces 1,6-alpha glycosidic bonds between these chains, creating the branched <b>amylopectin.</b> The <b>starch</b> debranching enzyme isoamylase removes some of these branches. Several isoforms of these enzymes exist, leading to a highly complex synthesis process.|$|R
