5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world to read them without interruption.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin {{is the only one who}} had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E
500|$|Barry also {{composed}} the love song [...] "We Have <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World", with lyrics by Burt Bacharach's regular lyricist Hal David, sung by Louis Armstrong. It is heard during the Bond–Tracy courtship montage, bridging Draco's birthday party in Portugal and Bond's burglary of the Gebrüder Gumbold law office in Bern, Switzerland. [...] Barry recalled Armstrong was very ill, but recorded {{the song in}} one take. The song was re-released in 1994, achieving the number three position during a 13-week spell in the UK charts. A Hal David song entitled [...] "Do You Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown?" [...] performed by Danish singer Nina also featured in the film in several scenes.|$|E

The band's advance went towards {{the construction of}} a home studio in Streatham, South London, which was completed in April 1993. Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into [...] "semi-meltdown", according to Shields, who was rumoured to have been suffering from writer's block. The band remained largely inactive, but they recorded and released two cover songs from 1993 to 1996—a rendering of [...] "We Have <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World" [...] by Louis Armstrong for Peace Together and a cover of [...] "Map Ref. 41°N 93°W" [...] by Wire for the tribute album Whore: Tribute to Wire.|$|E

Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and [...] "figured we'd work it out later". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put his head down and get his pension, but is asking for it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character.|$|E

Unable to finalise a third album, Shields isolated himself and, in his own words, went [...] "crazy", drawing comparisons in the music press to the behavior of musicians such as Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd. The other band members went their own ways {{during the period of}} inactivity following Loveless: Butcher contributed vocals to Collapsed Lung's 1996 single [...] "Board Game", and two tracks ("Ballad Night" [...] and [...] "Casino Kisschase") from the band's 1996 album Cooler, Googe had been sighted working as a cab driver in London and formed the supergroup Snowpony in 1996, Ó Cíosóig joined Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions, while Shields collaborated with Yo La Tengo, Primal Scream and Dinosaur Jr.|$|E
500|$|Back in London at M's office, Bond is {{informed}} that Blofeld intends {{to hold the}} world to ransom by threatening to destroy its agriculture using his brainwashed women. Apart from money, Blofeld demands amnesty for all past crimes and to be recognised as Count de Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck. Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's Aston Martin. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt open fire on the couple's car. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack. When a police officer arrives to help, a tearful Bond cradles Tracy's body and says: [...] "It's all right. It's quite all right, really. She's having a rest. We'll be going on soon. There's no hurry you see, we have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{contemporary}} artist usually sings {{during the}} title sequence and an instrumental {{version of the}} main track may also be featured as a leitmotif during the film, which repeats in various moods. Writing for Rolling Stone, Andy Greene says that [...] "James Bond title songs, as a rule, have {{the name of the}} movie in the chorus," [...] though he notes that this is not always the case. On Her Majesty's Secret Service has an entirely instrumental credit sequence, though the film features an alternate theme, [...] "We Have <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World", sung by Louis Armstrong. Until the Daniel Craig era, only Nobody Does It Better and All Time High served as an opening theme without sharing a title with the movie. John Barry provided the title song music on ten of the eleven films for which he composed the musical score. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song and become pop hits, including Paul McCartney's [...] "Live and Let Die", Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] (for the film The Spy Who Loved Me), and Sheena Easton's [...] "For Your Eyes Only" [...] with Adele's [...] "Skyfall" [...] and Sam Smith's [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] eventually winning the award.|$|E

500|$|While On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was within}} its {{post-production}} stages, Richard Maibaum wrote initial treatments and a script for Diamonds Are Forever as a revenge-themed sequel with Irma Bunt and Marc-Ange Draco returning, and Bond mourning his deceased wife Tracy while Louis Armstrong's [...] "We Have <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World" [...] {{played in the}} background. When George Lazenby departed from the role prior to the film's release, a complete rewrite was requested, in addition to Maibaum's script failing to impress Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Following this, an original plot had as a villain Auric Goldfinger's twin, seeking revenge {{for the death of}} his brother. The plot was later changed after Broccoli had a dream, where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter. So the character of Willard Whyte was created, and Tom Mankiewicz was chosen to rework the script. Mankiewicz says he was hired because Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script, since so much of it was set in Las Vegas [...] "and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters"— but it had to be someone who also understood the British idiom, since it had British characters. David Picker from United Artists had seen the stage musical Georgy! written by Mankiewicz, and recommended him; he was hired on a two-week trial and kept on {{for the rest of the}} movie. Mankiewicz later estimated the novel provided around 45 minutes of the film's final running time.|$|E

Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm.
