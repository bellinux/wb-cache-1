5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of items {{scattered}} around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these are always in the same place {{at the start of the}} game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> red herrings. Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain invulnerable to conventional attacks. Bosses guard pieces of the ACG key, and contact with them will rapidly drain away the player's health.|$|E

5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E

25|$|Peacock's {{own place}} in {{literature}} is pre-eminently {{that of a}} satirist. That he has nevertheless been the favourite only of the few is owing partly to the highly intellectual quality of his work, but mainly to his lack of ordinary qualifications of the novelist, all pretension to which he entirely disclaims. He has no plot, little human interest, and no consistent delineation of character. His personages <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> puppets, or, at best, incarnations of abstract qualities such as grace or beauty, but beautifully depicted.|$|E

According to inscriptions, they were all excavated within a short period of about thirty-three years, between 1441 and 1474.

25|$|According to {{a former}} Wall Street Journal columnist, figures used in human {{trafficking}} estimates rarely have identifiable sources or transparent methodologies behind them and in most (if not all) instances, they <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> guesses. Dumienski and Laura Agustin argue {{that this is a}} result of the fact that it is impossible to produce reliable statistics on a phenomenon happening in the shadow economy. According to a UNESCO Bangkok researcher, statistics on human trafficking may be unreliable due to overrepresentation of sex trafficking. As an example, he cites flaws in Thai statistics, who discount men from their official numbers because by law they cannot be considered trafficking victims due to their gender.|$|E
25|$|Hand-modeled clay female figurines {{are also}} highly {{characteristic}} of Las Charcas culture. Those found at Kaminaljuyu are generally of reddish brown clay {{and some have}} a white slip. The female figurines often depict pregnancy and {{are thought to have}} been offerings to promote fertility in the fields. Usually the arms and legs of the figures <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> stumps but some attempt at a realistic body shape has been made. The head has received the most attention to detail. The nose was pinched into the relief and nostrils were made by punctuating the clay. The eyes and the mouth were formed by strategically applied lumps. The figurines often have earplug flares.|$|E
25|$|Three major {{elements}} of the writing style indicate that the book can be classified as a psychological novel. The first is the emphasis {{of the mind and}} inner thoughts rather than the plot line and movement of the story. The feelings behind all actions chosen are far more important than the actions themselves; the actions <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> secondary behaviors in response to the psychological decisions of the character. Another element is the stream of consciousness, or inner monologue style of writing. The majority of the storyline takes place {{in the mind of the}} lead character rather than externally through actions and interactions with other characters. In addition to inner monologues, memories of dialogues or even imagined dialogues with other important characters aid in plot movement. The final element is the use of a non-chronological timeline and excessive flashbacks. The effect allows the reader to follow the character thought by thought through memories, feelings, and contemplations, thus creating the illusion that the reader is inside the character's mind, rather than a third party observer, as in classical novels.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to tell {{how much of the}} content of these traditional biographies is fiction and how much is fact. Large parts clearly <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> deduction from Juvenal's writings, but some elements appear more substantial. Juvenal never mentions a period of exile in his life, yet it appears in every extant traditional biography. Many scholars think the idea to be a later invention; the Satires do display some knowledge of Egypt and Britain, and it is thought that this gave rise to the tradition that Juvenal was exiled. Others, however - particularly Gilbert Highet - regard the exile as factual, and these scholars also supply a concrete date for the exile: 93 AD until 96, when Nerva became emperor. They argue that a reference to Juvenal in one of Martial's poems, which is dated to 92, {{is impossible}} if, at this stage Juvenal was already in exile, or, had served his time in exile, since in that case, Martial would not have wished to antagonise Domitian by mentioning such a persona non grata as Juvenal. If Juvenal was exiled, he would have lost his patrimony, and this may explain the consistent descriptions {{of the life of the}} client he bemoans in the Satires.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo {{reproduction}} {{is similar to}} that of opossums. The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo (the red kangaroo) the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs <b>are</b> <b>mere</b> stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by species. Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.|$|E
