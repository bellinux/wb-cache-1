5|$|In 1935, Butler wrote a {{book titled}} War Is <b>a</b> <b>Racket,</b> where he {{described}} and criticized {{the workings of the}} United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those he was a part of, including the American corporations and other imperialist motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular activist, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church groups in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E

Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as <b>a</b> <b>racket.</b> Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they could talk about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E

While attempting to get it fixed, Denny became acquainted with the newly forming model industry, one of whom convinced him to take it up as a hobby. In 1934 he started a small hobby shop with a partner on Hollywood Boulevard, but after two years it went out of business.|$|E
25|$|Tennis is <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> {{sport that}} can be played {{individually}} against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object {{of the game is}} to play the ball {{in such a way that}} the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.|$|E
25|$|Lewis Hoad {{was born}} on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of Glebe, the eldest of three sons of tramway {{electrician}} Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle. Hoad started playing tennis at age five with <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> gifted by a local social club. As a young child he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained and {{he was allowed to}} practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house. At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at Manly in the under 16 category.|$|E

25|$|Controversy {{was never}} far from McEnroe, however; in his fourth-round match against Mikael Pernfors at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was ejected from the tournament for {{swearing}} at the umpire, supervisor, and referee. He was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman, and then docked a point for smashing <b>a</b> <b>racket.</b> McEnroe was apparently unaware that a new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the tournament, meant that a third code violation would not lead to the deduction of a game but instead would result in immediate disqualification; therefore, when McEnroe unleashed a volley of abuse at umpire Gerry Armstrong, he was defaulted. He was fined $6,500 for the incidents.|$|E
25|$|The players spin <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> {{to decide}} who serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either {{the left or right}} service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not {{touching}} any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} main {{geographical}} {{regions in the}} game; Little Italy (controlled by the Corleone family), Brooklyn (controlled by the Tattaglia family), New Jersey (controlled by the Stracci family), Hell's Kitchen (controlled by the Cuneo family) and Midtown (controlled by the Barzini family). At {{the start of the}} game, the entire map is available for the player to explore, but the game encourages the player to remain in Little Italy, as it is the easiest area of which to gain control. To completely control an area, the player must extort all business and rackets owned by the other families, and take over their warehouses and hubs. Many businesses serve as fronts to rackets, which can be taken over in a similar manner to the front, although in the case of <b>a</b> <b>racket,</b> the player has the option of simply buying the racket boss out. Rackets yield more money than businesses.|$|E

25|$|Marginalized in the {{legitimate}} economy, {{a small group}} of blacks found success outside the law, running gambling on numbers. Invented in 1920 or 1921, numbers had exploded by 1924 into <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> turning over {{tens of millions of dollars}} every year. That year the New York Age reported that there were at least thirty bankers (the name given to someone running a numbers game) in Harlem, with many employing between twelve and twenty people to collect bets, and Marcellino, the largest banker, employing over one hundred. By the late 1920s, Wallace Thurman guessed there were over a thousand collectors taking bets from 100,000 clients a day. The most successful bankers, who could earn enormous sums of money, were known as Kings and Queens. The wealthiest numbers king of all was almost certainly the reputed inventor of the game, Casper Holstein. He owned a fleet of cars, apartment buildings in Harlem and a home on Long Island, but did not have the ostentatious style and lifestyle of many other kings. He, and other bankers, gave money to charities and loans to aspiring businessmen and needy residents. Holstein's role in the community extended further than most of his colleagues, included membership in the Monarch Lodge of the Elks, support for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, philanthropy in his native Virgin Islands, and patronage of the Harlem Renaissance.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his speeches to pacifist groups, he served from 1935 to 1937 as {{a spokesman for the}} American League Against War and Fascism.

500|$|The album's {{range of}} power and soft {{elements}} was noted. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne said that, while the band has always been [...] "adept at striking a balance between hurricane-force dissonance and fragile serenity", Yo La Tengo [...] "crack open their sound even wider here. Their muted, after-hours guitar drone is in full effect [...] As adults who still need to make <b>a</b> <b>racket,</b> they remain addicted to noise, but now the trio integrates the feedback into the arrangements, like squalls rumbling in the distance." [...] Dele Fadele of NME also praised the open-ended nature of the album, but criticized the instrumental [...] "Spec Bebop" [...] for being [...] "constructed around some hurtful feedback, to end up as an endurance test." [...] In a very positive review, Jason Josephes of Pitchfork praised the album for exploring new directions, commenting that the band takes its [...] "sonic inventions to new levels." ...|$|E
500|$|Oasis {{played their}} first ever live gig on 18 August 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester. Liam's brother Noel Gallagher, {{who was a}} roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded {{particularly}} spectacular, he did begin {{to consider the possibility}} of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. [...] "He had loads of stuff written," [...] Arthurs recalled. [...] "When he walked in, we were a band making <b>a</b> <b>racket</b> with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas." [...] Oasis under Noel Gallagher crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barre chords and root bass notes, McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound [...] "so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable." ...|$|E
