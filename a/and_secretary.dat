5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal Secretary of State {{in many ways}} evolved from the roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, {{the power of the}} Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of Pope Pius V (1566–1572) and his nephew Michele Bonelli, the cardinal-nephew <b>and</b> <b>secretary</b> of state were one and the same.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{rendezvous}} with Robert E. Lee's retreating forces at Farmville, Virginia, Breckinridge moved south to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he, Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory, and Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan joined Generals Joseph E. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard to urge surrender. Davis <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State Judah P. Benjamin initially resisted, but eventually asked Major General William T. Sherman to parley. Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on Lincoln's assassination on April 15) rejected them as too generous. On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet Richard Taylor in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men {{would refuse to}} fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at Appomattox.|$|E

5|$|After {{overseeing}} {{the transfer of}} Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee's forces at Farmville, Virginia, {{on the night of}} April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover that Lee had surrendered on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, he advised the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State Judah P. Benjamin disagreed. At Bennett Place, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman later praised Breckinridge's negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to offer the same terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.|$|E

Her long poem The Way of All the Earth or Woman of Kitezh (Kitezhanka) was published in complete form in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E
