5|$|Appeals {{from the}} local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart and towers to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but may have been near where St Catherine's Church now stands. A ditch of unknown date in that {{vicinity}} may represent <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the medieval defences.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{show that}} there is a 0.41 probability that the moon Halimede collided with Nereid at some time in the past. Although it is not known whether any collision has taken place, both moons appear to have similar ("grey") colors, implying that Halimede could be <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Nereid.|$|E

5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots {{on the face of the}} Stone, and it is officially described as being white with the exception of the face.|$|E
5|$|Stela 53 is <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> {{sculpture}} {{that was}} found in the latter Early Preclassic phase of Structure12, directly behind Stela 5. Stela53 forms a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. Stela5 was placed {{at the same time that}} Stela53 was embedded in Structure12, and the long count date on the former also allows the placing of Stela53 to be fixed in time at Late Preclassic–Early Classic transition.|$|E
5|$|Stela 74 is <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Olmec-style {{sculpture}} {{that was}} found in the Middle Preclassic fill of Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a cartouche and has other, smaller, U-symbols at its base. It is very similar to a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.|$|E

50|$|It {{contains}} <b>a</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> the Gospel of Luke 11:11-29; 13:16-34. Pierre Batiffol was {{the first}} to suggest that these fragments belong to the same manuscript. They were first discovered by Hidber, professor of Berne, then described by E. Ranke.|$|R

5|$|The {{exterior}} of the temple is richly decorated. The frieze depicts a continuous line of acanthus. Furthermore, there are ornaments on the capital, architrave, and soffit. The stones in the front cornice have projecting sculptures of lion heads. <b>A</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the architrave bearing a lion head was removed by Captain J Buchan Telfer {{in the late nineteenth}} century and bequeathed by him to the British Museum in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of how bin Laden {{was located}} by U.S. {{intelligence}} differ. The White House and CIA director John Brennan {{stated that the}} process began with <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, however, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention {{in exchange for a}} bounty.|$|E
5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} situation, where the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, and the nature and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up at an earlier perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E
5|$|Poor Jake's Demise is a 1913 American silent short slapstick comedy film {{directed}} by Allen Curtis and featuring Max Asher and Lon Chaney. The slapstick film focuses on Jake who finds {{his wife in}} a compromising position with another man and later takes his revenge with a seltzer bottle. It {{is one of several}} slapstick comedy films Chaney made for Universal at the start of his career and is also his first credited screen role. The film was presumed lost, but <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the film was discovered in England in May 2006 and restored.|$|E
5|$|The 17th century {{did not end}} {{well for}} the Grand Duke: he still had no grandchildren, France and Spain would not {{acknowledge}} his royal status and the Duke of Lorraine declared himself King of Jerusalem without any opposition. In May 1700 Cosimo embarked {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome. Pope Innocent XII, after much persuasion, created Cosimo a Canon of Saint John in the Lateran, in order to allow him to view the Volto Santo, a cloth thought to have been used by Christ before his crucifixion. Delighted by his warm reception from the Roman people, Cosimo left Rome with <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Saint Francis Xavier's bowels.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore Stone is <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> a large {{sandstone}} slab which originally {{stood at}} the mouth of the Singapore River. The large slab, which is believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly as early as the 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription. Recent theories suggest that the inscription is either in Old Javanese or in Sanskrit, which suggested a possibility that the island was an extension of the Majapahit civilisation in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} presumed lost, but <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> {{the film was}} {{discovered}} in England in May 2006.

5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the northern}} column of the 14th Panzer Division drove via Glina {{and crossed the}} Una at both Bosanska Kostajnica and Bosanski Novi before continuing its push east.

When they arrived at Jajce, Nedeljković ordered them to take up blocking positions on the narrow Vrbas valley at Krupa on the road between Banja Luka and Mrkonjić Grad. The rear area units of the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska were ordered to block the road from Kotor Varoš to Doboj.|$|E
