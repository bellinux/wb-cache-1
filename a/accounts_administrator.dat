50|$|A Windows {{administrator}} {{account is}} not an exact analogue of the Unix root account - AdministratorThe built-in administrator account and a user administrator account have {{the same level of}} privileges. The default user account created in Windows systems is an administrator account. Unlike macOS, Linux, and Windows Vista/7/8/10 administrator <b>accounts,</b> <b>administrator</b> accounts in Windows systems without UAC do not insulate the system from most of the pitfalls of full root access. One of these pitfalls includes decreased resilience to malware infections.|$|E

40|$|Tracker is {{a windows}} {{application}} that communicates with the web services hosted by a website. When minimized, this tool disappears {{from the screen}} and a small icon appears in the system tray, {{which can be used}} to re-activate the tool. Even when the tool is hidden, it works silently in the background. At some regular intervals of time, it communicates with website web services to find if there are any new alerts created. If it finds a new alert, the tool downloads the alerts and pops up a message displaying the alert. Technically, each alert is a record in an ‘Alert ’ database table. One of the fields in the table represents the time the alert is generated. In this paper, “Web Based Share Tracker”, the domain of the website is taken as the share market and the Tracker alerts on changes in the share values. It also provides 3 types of <b>accounts</b> <b>Administrator,</b> Sophisticated User and Customer. The main modules in this paper are the “Website- Administrator”, “Website – Sophisticated User”, “Website- Customer”, and “Tracker / IQRS tool ”Web services are required for interaction between the desktop application and the web server’s information and. NET provides best web service classes. Trackers need ‘Isolated Storage ’ available only in. NET. So. NET is used as the platform. The advantages of this paper are low network load, customizability of window application, ability to run on background, low process memory requirement, automatic timely alerts...|$|E
5000|$|In Windows Vista/7/8/10 <b>administrator</b> <b>accounts,</b> {{a prompt}} will appear to {{authenticate}} running a process with elevated privileges. Usually, no user credentials {{are required to}} authenticate the UAC prompt in <b>administrator</b> <b>accounts</b> but authenticating the UAC prompt requires entering the username and password of an administrator in standard user accounts. In Windows XP (and earlier systems) <b>administrator</b> <b>accounts,</b> authentication {{is not required to}} run a process with elevated privileges and this poses another security risk that {{led to the development of}} UAC. Users can set a process to run with elevated privileges from standard accounts by setting the process to [...] "run as administrator" [...] or using the [...] "runas" [...] command and authenticating the prompt with credentials (username and password) of an <b>administrator</b> <b>account.</b> Much of the benefit of authenticating from a standard account is negated if the <b>administrator</b> <b>account's</b> credentials being used has a blank password (as in the built-in <b>administrator</b> <b>account</b> in Windows XP and earlier systems).|$|R

50|$|In Windows NT {{and later}} systems derived from it (such as Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista/7/8/10), {{there must be}} at least one <b>administrator</b> <b>account</b> (Windows XP and earlier) or one able to elevate {{privileges}} to superuser (Windows Vista/7/8/10 via User Account Control). In Windows XP and earlier systems, there is a built-in <b>administrator</b> <b>account</b> that remains hidden when a user administrator-equivalent account exists. This built-in <b>administrator</b> <b>account</b> is created with a blank password. This poses security risks, so the built-in <b>administrator</b> <b>account</b> is disabled by default in Windows Vista and later systems due to the introduction of User Account Control (UAC).|$|R

50|$|The {{superuser}} is {{an authority}} level assigned to system administrators on most computer operating systems. In Unix and related operating systems, this level is also called root and has all access {{rights in the}} system, including changing ownership of files. In pre-Windows XP and NT systems (such as DOS and Windows 9x), all users are effectively superusers, and all users have all access rights. In Windows NT and related systems (such as Windows 2000 and XP), a superuser {{is known as the}} <b>Administrator</b> <b>account.</b> However, this <b>Administrator</b> <b>account</b> may or may not exist depending on whether separation of privileges has been set up.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{types of}} gold [...] "{{accounts}}" [...] are available. Different accounts impose varying types of intermediation between {{the client and}} their gold. One {{of the most important}} differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an allocated (fully reserved) or unallocated (pooled) basis. Unallocated gold accounts are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of a}} run on the issuer's gold on deposit. Another major difference is the strength of the account holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the <b>account</b> <b>administrator</b> faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or naked short position in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.|$|R
40|$|According to the 1996 - 97 AACSB {{membership}} directory, only 122 of the 326 (37 percent) {{institutions with}} accredited business schools also held accounting accreditation. The {{objective of the}} research reported in this paper was to determine why so few accounting programs are accredited. Surveys were mailed to the <b>accounting</b> program <b>administrator</b> at all 326 accredited institutions. One hundred sixty-one usable responses (49 percent) were received. Responses indicated major differences in the attitudes of administrators of accredited and nonaccredited accounting programs regarding <b>accounting</b> accreditation. Generally, <b>administrators</b> of accredited programs perceived significantly more value in <b>accounting</b> accreditation, while <b>administrators</b> of nonaccredited programs viewed accounting accreditation as a costly process. Results point to a possible decline in the interest level in accounting accreditation by nonaccredited programs. Perhaps the AACSB needs to increase its effort to promote the benefits of accounting accreditation to this group...|$|R

2500|$|When someone logs into Vista as a {{standard}} user, the system sets up a logon session and assigns a token containing only the most basic privileges. In this way, the new logon session cannot make changes that would affect the entire system. When a person logs in as a user with membership in the Administrators group, the system assigns two separate tokens. [...] The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, {{and the second is}} a restricted token similar to what {{a standard}} user would receive. User applications, including the Windows Shell, then start with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced-privilege environment - even when running under an <b>Administrator</b> <b>account.</b> When an application requests higher privileges or when a user selects a [...] "Run as administrator" [...] option, UAC will prompt standard users to enter the credentials of an <b>Administrator</b> <b>account</b> and prompt <b>Administrators</b> for confirmation and, if consent is given, continue or start the process using an unrestricted token.|$|R

50|$|Useful as it is, Everything {{is not a}} safe {{application}} in a multiuser environment. Because it requires access to the NTFS change journal, Everything must run with administrator privileges, either in a privileged user account or as a Windows service. As a Windows service it can expose search functionality to <b>accounts</b> without <b>administrator</b> privileges. However, Everything doesn't filter search results by client privileges before displaying them, so that every user can see every file on a volume, just {{as if they were}} using Everything in an <b>administrator</b> <b>account</b> themselves. Furthermore, a user can double-click a file name in the Everything results list to open the file or run it, if it is an executable, and Everything will launch the file with its own administrator credentials rather than with the user's own credentials. Although there may be a way to prevent privilege escalation when opening a file, there is no obvious remedy to prevent one user from listing the private files in another user's account.|$|R
