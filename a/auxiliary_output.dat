50|$|These can be {{compared}} as follows. The recursive traversal handles a leaf node (at the bottom) as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and analyzes a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes - actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off below). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a root node (at the top) as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being synthesized of a root node and its children, then produces as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>output</b> a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step - the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off above).

40|$|The depth {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} behind the great success of {{convolutional}} neural networks (CNNs), with the gradient vanishing issue having been largely addressed by various nets, e. g.

This means that intermediate layers receive less supervision information and will lead to redundancy in models. As a result, the model becomes very redundant and the over-fitting issue may happen. To address this, we propose a model, called AuxNet, by introducing <b>auxiliary</b> <b>outputs</b> at intermediate layers.

5000|$|A Virtual Mixer is a {{software}} application {{that runs on}} a computer or other digital audio system. Providing the same functionality of a digital or analog mixing console, a virtual mixer takes the audio outputs of many separate tracks or live sources and combines them {{into a pair of}} stereo outputs or other routed subgroups for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>outputs.</b> == History == Around the mid 1990s, computers achieved a level of processing power that allowed for professional recordings to be done digitally. In the following decade, many artists began recording their own music in home studios with the aid of DAW (digital audio workstation) software like GarageBand or ProTools. It was this move away from high end studios and the rise of computing power in personal computers that gave rise to virtual mixers that required minimal to no physical interface. == Design == The design of most virtual mixers is modeled after physical mixers. The individual channel strips are arranged side-by-side and the user is given control over level and pan. There is also a single master fader for the stereo output. The actual controls are also modeled after physical mixers, featuring faders and knobs that can be controlled using a mouse and keyboard shortcuts.|$|R
