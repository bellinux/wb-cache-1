5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as it seems to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} keyboards had {{a typewriter}} key travel distance of 0.187inches (4.75mm), keytops were <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> (12.7mm) high, and keyboards were {{about two inches}} (5cm) thick. Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110inches (2.79mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard that was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> thick.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} smelter was a bole, a large fire {{built on}} a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as bing and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.|$|E

25|$|Pizza strips are {{prepared}} in Italian bakeries {{and sold in}} most supermarkets and convenience stores. They are rectangular strips of pizza without cheese. Their rich flavor comes solely from a dense, zesty tomato paste baked on <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> (1.3cm) thick pan pizza crust, and may be enjoyed warm or cold. Party pizza is a box of these pizza strips. Spinach pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce, and cheese. Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with the spinach.|$|E
25|$|Humans in {{contrast}} have thirty-two teeth, sixteen on each jaw, each tooth less than <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> long. Of these teeth, {{there are four}} incisors, two canines, four premolars, and six molars. While human incisors are capable of biting into meat, bears have more powerful jaw muscles, which make their bite more destructive to flesh. More appropriate comparisons to bear dentition are to those of dogs whose teeth are similar in proportion to those of bears (and of course much smaller, although capable of inflicting much damage even at their smaller size).|$|E
25|$|When England {{returned}} the visit in 1933–34, Jeoomal {{missed the first}} Test. He scored 2 and 43 at Calcutta, but in Madras, he was hit on the face by Nobby Clark. The ball left <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> cut across the left eye. The injury ended his innings {{and he did not}} play another Test. In his first match in the Ranji Trophy, for Sind against Western India in 1934–35, he scored 63 and 53, despite being hit by Amar Singh and Ladha Ramji, and took 5/78 and 3/52 in bowling. He played in the Sind Pentangular matches from 1922 till 1946, scoring 1,993 runs (average 47) with six hundreds.|$|E
50|$|The EIAJ format was <b>a</b> {{standard}} <b>half-inch</b> format used {{by various}} manufacturers. EIAJ-1 was an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 used a cartridge that contained a supply reel; the take-up reel {{was part of}} the recorder, and the tape had to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, a slow procedure.|$|R

25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|The storm {{moved into}} Illinois and Wisconsin in the {{afternoon}} of December 1. An inch or two of snow fell in many areas, before a wintry mix of icy precipitation (up to <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> of ice accumulation) made things even more treacherous. Numerous highway accidents were reported, resulting in three deaths in Wisconsin and one in Illinois, as well as numerous injuries. In addition, a Mesa Airlines plane with 25 passengers slid off the runway at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison, but no injuries were reported. 400 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 28 at Midway International Airport and dozens more at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. At {{the height of the}} storm, 140,000 customers were without power in Illinois, due to the storm.|$|E
25|$|The Colorado River is a {{major source}} of water in the Southwest and many dams, such as the Hoover Dam, form {{reservoirs}} along it. So much water is drawn for drinking water throughout the West and irrigation in California that in most years, water from the Colorado River no longer reaches the Gulf of California. The Columbia River, the largest river in volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from North America, and its tributary, the Snake River, water the Pacific Northwest. The Platte runs through Nebraska and was known for being a mile (2km) wide but only <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> (1cm) deep. The Rio Grande forms the border between Texas and Mexico before turning due north and splitting New Mexico in half.|$|E
50|$|The EIAJ {{format is}} <b>a</b> {{standard}} <b>half-inch</b> format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge {{that contains a}} supply reel, but not the take-up reel.

25|$|The storm then {{proceeded}} to produce a significant swath of ice {{across much of the}} Central Plains. Both storms in total produced between <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> to an inch of ice from Oklahoma to Wisconsin, while 8 to 24inches of snow (20–60cm) fell over the mountains of Utah, the highest amount being reported in northern Park City; 6 to 12inches(15–30cm) fell over Colorado and New Mexico while generally less than 6inches fell on the northern side of the system from Nebraska to Quebec, although 10inches (25cm) fell in the Saguenay region of Quebec due to the orographic effect and Lake Saint-Jean. A mixture of snow, sleet, ice, and rain also fell across many of the affected areas. The main energy of the system responsible for the ice storm later moved east and affected portions of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States with snow and rain on December 13, with the heaviest snow falling across southern and central New York and central New England. Portions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York received as much as 12inches (30cm) of snow from the storm, including 7inches (18cm) in Boston.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{winter storm}} {{developed}} on December 14 {{east of the}} Rockies and across the southern states and traveled across {{many of the same}} areas, bringing significant snows to areas that were affected by both ice storms. Portions of Kansas received over a foot (30cm) of snow on top of the accumulated ice. The system moved across the Great Lakes region on December 15 and 16 and intensified while adding moisture from a developing coastal low as well as residual moisture from what was Tropical Storm Olga that affected most of the Antilles and Caribbean. Several areas in the Midwest and eastern North America received close to a foot of snow including Chicago, some areas of the Toronto and Detroit areas, Montreal, and Ottawa. Accumulations of as much as 20inches (50cm) fell across northern New England, northern New York, eastern Ontario from rural eastern Ottawa to Cornwall, and north of the Saint Lawrence River in the province of Quebec into the Charlevoix region. Thundersnow was even reported across portions of southern Ontario and Quebec. Widespread amounts of snow between 8 and 14inches (20–35cm) were reported across Ontario, Quebec, most of New England and the Canadian Maritimes as well as in several areas of the Midwest including Kansas and Missouri, while between <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> to an inch (13–25mm) of ice fell across higher elevations in Maryland and Virginia with significant icing as well over West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This was accompanied by heavy rain between 2 and 4inches (50–100mm) south of the Mason–Dixon line towards the Carolinas and the Southeast, with significant rainfall across the Middle Atlantic Coast, coastal sections of Nova Scotia, and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador. Additionally, heavy thunderstorms developed across the Southern states near the Gulf of Mexico coast, where tornado watches were issued for portions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina on December 15 with several tornadoes later confirmed. The storm finally exited off the coast into the Atlantic Ocean on December 18.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary damage surveys {{conducted}} {{by a group of}} structural engineers from Texas Tech University determined that many of the frame homes that were destroyed by the Bridge Creek−Moore tornado were constructed below minimal residential building code standards, discovering some structural deficiencies that violated codes, which were considered to be inadequate for regions prone to tornadic activity (under federal building code standards, frame homes that were properly strapped and bolted would have withstood winds between 152 and 157 miles per hour (245 and 253km/h), equivalent to an F2 tornado). The team, led by meteorological researcher Charles Doswell and storm damage engineer/meteorologist Tim Marshall, determined that nails attached to a plywood roof deck in one damaged home were not properly anchored to the rafters; several homes in rural areas that were swept nearly [...] from their original location did not have anchor bolts that secured the frame to their foundations, as was the case at Country Place Estates, where the homes − which left a trail of debris strewn [...] away from their location − were attached to the concrete foundations by tapered cut nails that extended only <b>a</b> <b>half-inch</b> to the bases; many homes that were left at least partially standing also had their garage doors (mainly those made from aluminum material) collapse inward, allowing the tornado's destructive winds to enter the houses.|$|E
