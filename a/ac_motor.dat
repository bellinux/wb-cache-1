5|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive (VFD; also termed adjustable-frequency drive, variable speed drive, AC drive, micro drive or inverter drive) {{is a type}} of adjustable-speed drive used in electro-mechanical drive systems to control <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and voltage.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an asynchronous <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E
25|$|AC loads {{can occur}} in <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> run capacitors, for voltage doubling, in snubbers, {{lighting}} ballast and for power factor correction PFC for phase shifting to improve transmission network stability and efficiency, {{which is one of}} the most important applications for large power capacitors. These mostly large PP film or metallized paper capacitors are limited by the rated reactive power VAr.|$|E

In February 2004, the first handcrafted aluminum body shell was built at Frimley works.|$|E
50|$|Most DC {{field coils}} {{generate}} a constant, static field. Most three-phase AC field coils {{are used to}} generate a rotating field {{as part of an}} electric <b>motor.</b> Single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> may follow either of these patterns: small motors are usually universal motors, like the brushed DC motor with a commutator, but run from <b>AC.</b> Larger <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> are generally induction motors, whether these are three- or single-phase.|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} AC {{induction}} and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC {{to produce a}} rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.|$|E
25|$|Early {{electrification}} was too {{limited to}} have a big impact on the late 19th century economy. Electricity was also very expensive because of the low conversion efficiency of fuel to power, the small scale of power plants and the fact that most utilities offered only nighttime service. Daytime service became common during the early 20th century after the introduction of the <b>AC</b> <b>motor,</b> which tended to be used more during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or electric street railway (tram or streetcar).|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Westinghouse {{continued}} to pour money and engineering resources into {{the goal of}} building a completely integrated AC system, obtaining the Sawyer–Man lamp by buying Consolidated Electric Light, developing components such as an induction meter, and obtaining the rights to inventor Nikola Tesla's brushless AC induction motor along with patents for {{a new type of}} electric power distribution, polyphase alternating current. The acquisition of a feasible <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> gave Westinghouse a key patent for his system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while.|$|E

25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

500|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive is a device {{used in a}} drive system consisting of the following three main sub-systems: [...] <b>AC</b> <b>motor,</b> main drive controller assembly, and drive/operator interface.|$|E
500|$|In variable-torque {{applications}} {{suited for}} Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> characteristics {{require that the}} voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a linear V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460V, 60Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is [...] 460/60 = 7.67V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in quadratic V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.|$|E
