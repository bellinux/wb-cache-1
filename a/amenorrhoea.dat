25|$|Granulomas in the {{pituitary}} gland, {{which produces}} numerous hormones, is rare but leads {{to any of}} the symptoms of hypopituitarism: <b>amenorrhoea</b> (cessation of the menstrual cycle), diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to inability to concentrate the urine), hypothyroidism (decreased activity of the thyroid) or hypocortisolism (deficiency of cortisol).|$|E
25|$|If the {{condition}} has not already been diagnosed, it usually becomes apparent at puberty around age twelve with primary <b>amenorrhoea</b> and virilization. This may include descending of the testes, hirsutism (facial/body hair considered normal in males - {{not to be}} confused with hypertrichosis), deepening of the voice, and enlargement of the clitoris into what would then be classed as a penis.|$|E

25|$|In a 2001 case study, {{physicians}} reported clinical {{changes in}} a 30-year-old {{woman who had been}} exposed to a massive dosage (144,000 pg/g blood fat) of dioxin equal to 16,000 times the normal body level; the highest dose of dioxin ever recorded in a human. She suffered from chloracne, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, loss of appetite, leukocytosis, anemia, <b>amenorrhoea</b> and thrombocytopenia. However, other notable laboratory tests, such as immune function tests, were relatively normal. The same study also covered a second subject who had received a dosage equivalent to 2,900 times the normal level, who apparently suffered no notable negative effects other than chloracne. These patients were provided with olestra to accelerate dioxin elimination.|$|E
500|$|By 1849, {{generators}} {{based on}} Faraday's law of induction had become advanced enough to replace {{both types of}} machines, and Bird was recommending them in his lectures. [...] Galvanic cells suffered from the inconvenience of {{having to deal with}} the electrolyte acids in the surgery and the possibility of spillages; electrostatic generators required a great deal of skill and attention to keep them working successfully. [...] Electromagnetic machines, on the other hand, have neither of these drawbacks; the only criticism levelled by Bird was that the cheaper machines could only deliver an alternating current. [...] For medical use, particularly when treating a problem with nerves, a unidirectional current of a particular polarity was often needed, requiring the machine to have split rings or similar mechanisms. However, Bird considered alternating current machines suitable for cases of <b>amenorrhœa.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although less {{dangerous}} than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, {{and would be}} exacerbated by constant exposure {{to high levels of}} mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and <b>amenorrhoea</b> and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems.|$|E
500|$|Electric {{stimulation}} {{treatment was}} used to treat nervous disorders where the nervous system was unable to stimulate a required glandular secretion or muscle activity. [...] It had previously been successfully used to treat some forms of asthma. [...] Bird used his apparatus to treat Sydenham's chorea (St Vitus's dance) {{and other forms of}} spasm, some forms of paralysis (although the treatment was of no use where nerves had been physically damaged), opiate overdose (since it kept the patient awake), bringing on menstruation where this had failed (<b>amenorrhoea),</b> and hysteria, a supposed disease of women. [...] Paralysed bladder function in young girls was attributed to the now archaic condition of hysteria. [...] It was treated with the application of a strong electric current between the sacrum and the pubis. [...] Although the treatment worked, in that it caused the bladder to empty, Bird suspected in many cases it did so more through fear and pain than any therapeutic property of electricity.Smellie, p. 30 (opiates)Smellie, p. 47 (menstruation)Smellie, p. 75 (muscle paralysis)Smellie, pp. 91–92 (spasm and hysteria)Morus, pp. 146, 240–241 ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Amenorrhoea</b> (BE), {{amenorrhea}} (AmE), or <b>amenorrhœa,</b> is {{the absence}} of a menstrual period in a woman of reproductive age. Physiological states of <b>amenorrhoea</b> are seen, most commonly, during pregnancy and lactation (breastfeeding), the latter also forming the basis of a form of contraception known as the lactational <b>amenorrhoea</b> method. Outside of the reproductive years there is absence of menses during childhood and after menopause.|$|E
5000|$|Breastfeeding is {{a common}} cause of {{secondary}} <b>amenorrhoea,</b> and often the condition lasts for over six months. Breastfeeding typically lasts longer than lactational <b>amenorrhoea,</b> and the duration of <b>amenorrhoea</b> varies depending on how often a women breastfeeds. [...] Lactational <b>amenorrhoea</b> has been advocated {{as a method of}} family planning, especially in developing countries where access to other methods of contraception may be limited. Breastfeeding is said to prevent more births in the developing world than any other method of birth control or contraception. Lactational <b>amenorrhoea</b> is 98% percent effective as a method of preventing pregnancy {{in the first six months}} postpartum.|$|E
50|$|The social {{effects of}} <b>amenorrhoea</b> {{on a person}} vary significantly. <b>Amenorrhoea</b> is often {{associated}} with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, which have their own effects. If secondary <b>amenorrhoea</b> is triggered early in life, for example through excessive exercise or weight loss, menarche may not return later in life. A woman in this situation may be unable to become pregnant, even with the help of drugs. Long-term <b>amenorrhoea</b> leads to an estrogen deficiency which can bring about menopause at an early age. The hormone estrogen plays a significant role in regulating calcium loss after ages 25-30. When her ovaries no longer produce estrogen because of <b>amenorrhoea,</b> a woman is more likely to suffer rapid calcium loss, which in turn can lead to osteoporosis. Increased testosterone levels cause by <b>amenorrhoea</b> may lead to body hair growth and decreased breast size. Increased levels of androgens, especially testosterone, can also lead to ovarian cysts. Some research among amenorrhoeic runners indicates that the loss of menses may be accompanied by a loss of self-esteem.|$|E
50|$|When a {{woman is}} {{experiencing}} <b>amenorrhoea,</b> an eating disorder, and osteoporosis together, this is called female athlete triad syndrome. A lack of eating causes <b>amenorrhoea</b> and bone loss leading to osteopenia and sometimes progressing to osteoporosis.|$|E
50|$|Looking at Hypothalamic <b>amenorrhoea,</b> {{studies have}} {{provided}} that the administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) might correct abnormalities of Functional Hypothalamic <b>Amenorrhoea</b> (FHA) related to the condition of stress-related <b>amenorrhoea.</b> This involves the repair of the PI3K signaling pathway, which facilitates the integration of metabolic and neural signals regulating gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)/luteinizing hormone (LH). In other words, it regulates the neuronal activity and expression of neuropeptide systems that promote GnRH release. However, SSRI therapy represents a possible hormonal solution to just one hormonal condition of hypothalamic <b>amenorrhoea.</b> Furthermore, because the condition involves the inter workings of many different neurotransmitters, much research is still {{to be done on}} presenting hormonal treatment that would counteract the hormonal affects.|$|E
5000|$|Certain medications, {{particularly}} contraceptive medications, can induce <b>amenorrhoea</b> in {{a healthy}} woman. The lack of menstruation usually begins shortly after beginning the medication and {{can take up to}} a year to resume after stopping a medication. Hormonal contraceptives that contain only progestogen like the oral contraceptive Micronor, and especially higher-dose formulations like the injectable Depo Provera commonly induce this side-effect. Extended cycle use of combined hormonal contraceptives also allow suppression of menstruation. Patients who use and then cease using contraceptives like the combined oral contraceptive pill may experience secondary <b>amenorrhoea</b> as a withdrawal symptom. The link is not well understood, as studies have found no difference in hormone levels between women who develop <b>amenorrhoea</b> as a withdrawal symptom following the cessation of OCOP use and women who experience secondary <b>amenorrhoea</b> because of other reasons. [...] New contraceptive pills, like continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) which do not have the normal 7 days of placebo pills in each cycle, have been shown to increase rates of <b>amenorrhoea</b> in women. Studies show that women are most likely to experience <b>amenorrhoea</b> after 1 year of treatment with continuous OCP use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amenorrhoea</b> {{can also}} be caused by {{physical}} deformities. One {{example of this is}} Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, the second-most common cause of primary <b>amenorrhoea.</b> The syndrome is characterized by Müllerian agenesis. In MRKH Syndrome, the Müllerian ducts do not develop, which prevents menstruation. The syndrome usually develops during the first trimester of pregnancy. MRI techniques can be helpful in determining the extent of the problem. Women may recover from MRKH syndrome, but other times primary <b>amenorrhoea,</b> which is characteristic of the disorder, may prevent pregnancy for life.|$|E

50|$|<b>Amenorrhoea</b> is {{a symptom}} with many {{potential}} causes.Primary <b>amenorrhoea</b> (menstrual cycles never starting) {{may be caused by}} developmental problems, such as the congenital absence of the uterus or failure of the ovary to receive or maintain egg cells. Also, delay in pubertal development will lead to primary <b>amenorrhoea.</b> It is defined as an absence of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 with no menarche or normal secondary sexual characteristics but no menarche by 16 years of age.Secondary <b>amenorrhoea</b> (menstrual cycles ceasing) is often caused by hormonal disturbances from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, from premature menopause or intrauterine scar formation. It is defined as the absence of menses for three months in a woman with previously normal menstruation or nine months for women with a history of oligomenorrhoea.|$|E
5000|$|Primary <b>amenorrhoea</b> can be {{diagnosed}} in female children by age 14 if no secondary sex characteristics, such as enlarged breasts and body hair, are present. [...] In {{the absence of}} secondary sex characteristics, {{the most common cause}} of <b>amenorrhoea</b> is low levels of FSH and LH caused by a delay in puberty. Gonadal dysgenesis, often associated with Turner's Syndrome, or premature ovarian failure may also be to blame. If secondary sex characteristics are present, but menstruation is not, primary <b>amenorrhoea</b> can {{be diagnosed}} by age 16. A reason for this occurrence may be that a person phenotypically female but genetically male, a situation known as androgen insensitivity syndrome. If undescended testes are present, they are often removed after puberty (~21 years of age) due to the increased risk of testicular cancer. In the absence of undescended testes, an MRI can be used to determine whether or not a uterus is present. Müllerian agenesis causes around 15% of primary <b>amenorrhoea</b> cases. If a uterus is present, outflow track obstruction may be to blame for primary <b>amenorrhoea.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{pregnancy}} {{and for some}} time after childbirth, menstruation does not occur; this state is known as <b>amenorrhoea.</b> If menstruation has not resumed, fertility is low during lactation. The average length of postpartum <b>amenorrhoea</b> is longer when certain breastfeeding practices are followed; this may be done intentionally as birth control.|$|E

50|$|Women {{who perform}} {{considerable}} amounts of exercise {{on a regular}} basis or lose a significant amount of weight are at risk of developing hypothalamic (or 'athletic') <b>amenorrhoea.</b> Functional Hypothalamic <b>Amenorrhoea</b> (FHA) can be caused by stress, weight loss, and/or excessive exercise. Many women who diet or who exercise at a high level do not take in enough calories to expend on their exercise as well as to maintain their normal menstrual cycles. The threshold of developing <b>amenorrhoea</b> appears to be dependent on low energy availability rather than absolute weight because a critical minimum amount of stored, easily mobilized energy is necessary to maintain regular menstrual cycles.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two primary}} ways to {{classify}} <b>amenorrhoea.</b> Types of <b>amenorrhoea</b> {{are classified as}} primary or secondary, or based on functional [...] "compartments". The latter classification relates to the hormonal state of the patient that hypo-, eu-, or hypergonadotropic (whereby interruption to the communication between gonads and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) causes FSH levels to be either low, normal or high).|$|E
5000|$|By primary vs. secondary: Primary <b>amenorrhoea</b> is {{the absence}} of {{menstruation}} in a woman by the age of 16. As pubertal changes precede the first period, or menarche, female children by the age of 14 who still have not reached menarche, plus having no sign of secondary sexual characteristics, such as thelarche or pubarche—thus are without evidence of initiation of puberty—are also considered as having primary <b>amenorrhoea.</b> Secondary <b>amenorrhoea</b> is where an established menstruation has ceased—for three months in a woman with a history of regular cyclic bleeding, or nine months in a woman with a history of irregular periods. This usually happens to women aged 40-55. However, adolescent athletes are more likely to experience disturbances to the menstrual cycle than athletes of any other age. <b>Amenorrhoea</b> may cause serious pain in the back near the pelvis and spine. This pain has no cure, but can be relieved by a short course of progesterone to trigger menstrual bleeding.|$|E

5000|$|In females {{diagnosis}} is sometimes further delayed as other causes of <b>amenorrhoea</b> normally {{have to be}} investigated first before a case of KS/CHH is considered. [...] KS/CHH can still occur in females in cases when menstruation has begun but stopped after one or two menstrual bleeds. A study of GnRH deficient women in 2011 showed that 10% had experienced one or two bleeds {{before the onset of}} <b>amenorrhoea.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anti-psychotic drugs used {{to treat}} {{schizophrenia}} {{have been known to}} cause <b>amenorrhoea</b> as well. New research suggests that adding a dosage of Metformin to an anti-psychotic drug regimen can restore menstruation. Metformin decreases resistance to the hormone insulin, as well as levels of prolactin, testosterone, and lutenizing hormone (LH). Metformin also decreases the LH/FSH ratio. Results of the study on Metformin further implicate the regulation of these hormones as a main cause of secondary <b>amenorrhoea.</b>|$|E
50|$|Treatments vary {{based on}} the {{underlying}} condition. Key issues are problems of surgical correction if appropriate and oestrogen therapy if oestrogen levels are low. For {{those who do not}} plan to have biological children, treatment may be unnecessary if the underlying cause of the <b>amenorrhoea</b> is not threatening to their health. However, in the case of athletic <b>amenorrhoea,</b> deficiencies in estrogen and leptin often simultaneously result in bone loss, potentially leading to osteoporosis.|$|E
50|$|The use of opiates (such as heroin) on {{a regular}} basis has also been known to cause <b>amenorrhoea</b> in longer term users.|$|E
50|$|As for {{physiological}} {{treatments to}} hypothalamic <b>amenorrhoea,</b> injections of metreleptin (r-metHuLeptin) {{have been tested}} as treatment to oestrogen deficiency resulting from low gonadotropins and other neuroendocrine defects such as low concentrations of thyroid and IGF-1. R-metHuLeptin has appeared effective in restoring defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and improving reproductive, thyroid, and IGF hormones, as well as bone formation, thus curing the <b>amenorrhoea</b> and infertility. However, it has not proved effective in restoring of cortisol and adrenocorticotropin levels, or bone resorption.|$|E
