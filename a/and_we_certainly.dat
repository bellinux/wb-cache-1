Lead singer Chris Martin stated, [...] "We really feel that we have to be away for a while <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> won't release anything this year, because I think people are a bit sick of us." [...] This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced; but they were trying [...] "to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard".|$|E
500|$|While Nintendo did not {{formally}} announce {{plans for a}} Metroid title for the Wii U, Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi mentioned in an interview how such a title could {{make use of the}} console's tablet controller to perform actions such as scanning enemies and retrieving information. A demo program for the Wii U, titled Battle Mii, showed Mii characters dressed in Varia Suits, as well as Samus's gunship from Other M; this was later revealed as a mini-game called [...] "Metroid Blast", which is featured in Nintendo Land. Nintendo Land producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was also involved with the Prime trilogy, has declared that this minigame reflects his ideas for future Metroid titles, while also displaying the series is [...] "a franchise that we value <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> want to {{see what we can do}} with it in the future". Miyamoto added that Retro is [...] "a very high priority" [...] in the development of more Metroid games. In 2014, a former artist from Next Level Games revealed his company had interest in developing a 3DS Metroid game, going as far as building a prototype, before Nintendo asked them to do [...] instead.|$|E

500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E

2500|$|As far as Led Zeppelin's studio {{recordings}} went, {{every single}} one of them has a certain ambiance, certain atmospherics that made them special.

In an interview in 2003, Taylor expressed that [...] "we are both sensitive to the fact that Okinawan music {{is an important part of}} Okinawan culture, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> don't want to disrespect it or commercialize it in a cheap way for profit.

2500|$|The United Keetoowah Band did {{not sign}} or approve the resolution. [...] The Cherokee Nation {{acknowledges}} {{the existence of}} people of Cherokee descent [...] "...in states such as Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas," [...] who are Cherokee by ancestry but who are not considered members of the Cherokee Nation. [...] "There are more than 200 groups that we’ve been able to recognize that call themselves a Cherokee nation, tribe, or band," [...] said Mike Miller, spokesman for the Cherokee Nation. [...] "Only three are federally recognized, but the other groups run the gamut of intent. Some are basically heritage groups – people who have family with Cherokee heritage {{who are interested in}} the language and culture, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> encourage that," [...] said Miller.

2500|$|Another {{problem was}} that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI {{would never be able}} to capture the human ability to {{understand}} context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell would later explain), an argument of this form can not be won: just because one can not imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus':"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the bombing, an obscure group called the [...] "Islamic Jihad" [...] claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack. There were many in the U.S. government, such as Vice President Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, and National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane (who was formerly Reagan's Mideast envoy), who believed Iran and/or Syria were/was responsible for the bombings. After some years of investigation, the U.S. government now believes that elements of what would eventually become Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, were responsible for these bombings as well as the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut earlier in April. It is believed that Hezbollah used the name [...] "Islamic Jihad" [...] to remain anonymous. Hezbollah eventually announced its existence in 1985. This is while, according to President Reagan's Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger [...] "We still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't then". Weinberger mentions lack of certainty about Syria or Iran's involvement as the reason why America did not take any retaliatory actions against those states. To date, Hezbollah, Iran and Syria have continued to deny any involvement in any of the bombings. A fanatic Iranian group erected a monument in a cemetery in Tehran to commemorate the 1983 bombings and its [...] "martyrs" [...] in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger stated at {{the time}} that the {{strength}} of the Qing has been thoroughly demonstrated and that her prestige remained unsullied. [...] "Whatever danger there may be to the permanence of Qing's triumph lies rather from Russia than from the peoples of Tian Shan Nan Lu; nor is there much danger that the Chinese laurels will become faded even before a European foe. Zuo Zongtang and his generals such as Jin Shun and Chang Yao, accomplished a task which would reflect credit on any army and any country. They have given a luster to the modern Chinese administration which must stand it in good stead, and they have acquired a personal renown that will not easily depart. The Qing reconquest of Xinjiang is beyond doubt the most remarkable event that has occurred in Asia during the last fifty years, and it is quite the most brilliant achievement of a Chinese army, led by Chinese generals, that has taken place since the Qianlong Emperor subdued the country more than a century ago. It also proves, in a manner that is more than unpalatable to us, that the Chinese possess an adaptive faculty that must be held to be a very important fact in every-day politics in Central Asia. They reconquered Kashgaria with European weapons and by careful study of Western science and technology. Their soldiers marched in obedience to instructors trained on the Prussian principle; and their generals maneuvered their troops in accordance with the teachings of Moltke and Manteuffel. Even in such minor matters as the use of telescopes and field glasses we could find this Chinese army well supplied. Nothing was more absurd than the picture drawn by some over-wise observer of this army, as consisting of soldiers fantastically garbed in the guise of dragons and other hideous appearances. All that belonged to an old-world theory. The rebel troops were as widely different from all previous Chinese armies in Central Asia as it well could be; and in all essentials closely resembled that of a European power. Its remarkable triumphs were chiefly attributable to the thoroughness with which China had in this instance adapted herself to Western notions". [...] "But, although our hands are tied in Central Asia, they are not fettered at Pekin, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> should congratulate, if we have not done so already, the Chinese on their remarkable successes in the Tian Shan regions. That step might be pregnant with beneficent results, and our desire to be on good terms with our new, yet our old, neighbour might be met in a cordial manner by the Chinese." ...|$|E
