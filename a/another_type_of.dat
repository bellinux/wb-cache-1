5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{mounting}} {{that became}} fashionable around the mid-Heian period is the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} characteristically shaped hilt, which is pierced along the center. In this style, the hilt is fitted with an ornamental border and did not contain any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this mounting were used for ceremonial purposes but also in warfare, as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|In the Sritattvanidhi, the {{depiction}} prescribed for Sharabeshwaramurti is of thirty arms; {{arms on the}} right are to hold thunderbolt, mushti, abhaya, chakra (discus), sakti, staff, goad, sword, Khatvanga, axe, akshamala, a bone, bow, musala, and fire; and the left hands to display noose, varada, mace, arrow, flag, and <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> sword, a snake, a lotus flower, skull-cup, pustaka, plough, and mrudanga with one hand encircling Durga in a hug.

5|$|Nethicite, <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> magicite, {{works by}} {{absorbing}} Mist, thus nullifying {{the effects of}} magic and storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite {{can be described as}} either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or man-made). During the course of the game, it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, and that the ultimate source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun-Cryst they created. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|The deltoid {{curve is}} <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{curvilinear}} triangle, but {{one in which}} the curves replacing each side of an equilateral triangle are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed by rolling one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with collinear endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.|$|E
5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal ganglia (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (<b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E

This typology, based on four facets and three levels of abstraction (conceptual, detailed, technical), permits identifying <b>another</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> deviations and inconsistencies not considered in the literature.

5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which {{is driven by the}} superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud is <b>another</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, {{they form}} at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded {{by a strong}} inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
