40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments in order to investigate {{on the effect of}} lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash on hydraulic conductivity of sand. The study were conducted on Baldivis Yellow Concrete Sand (The Western Australian sand) with different percentage of lime (% 1, 2 %, 3 %), fly ash (% 5, % 10, % 15) and composition of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash. A few researches carried out in this field however, the result of current study revealed an effective role of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash in the reduction of hydraulic conductivity of sand. The obtained results illustrated that, in compared with the other results of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash specimens the combination of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash had a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity of sand. Hence, it seems that utilization of the combination of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash was more effective than use additives alone (i. e., lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash) ...|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s {{there was}} a dirt {{airstrip}} known as Dutch Flats {{in what is now}} the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma. That is where Charles Lindbergh first tested <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> his airplane, The Spirit of St. Louis, which had been built in San Diego by the Ryan Aeronautical Company.

5|$|Having {{completed}} his pre-flight training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned {{as a second}} lieutenant. After advanced training at Camp Kearny, California, {{he was assigned to}} Marine Squadron VMJ-353 <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> R4D transport planes. Glenn was posted to the Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California in July 1943 and joined VMO-155, which flew the F4F Wildcat fighter. The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the F4U Corsair in September 1943. He was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944. It was intended that VMO-155 would move to the Marshall Islands but this was delayed, and on February 21 it moved to Midway Atoll and became part of the garrison. This had been the site of the Battle of Midway in 1942, but was a backwater by this time. VMO-155 moved to the Marshall Islands in June 1944, <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> 57 combat missions in the area. He received two Distinguished Flying Crosses and ten Air Medals.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} community assembly mechanisms driving the temporal patterns, succession and seasonality, in dung-inhabiting insects as a model community of insects inhabiting ephemeral habitats. I {{have shown that the}} succession of dung-inhabiting beetle <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> species follows the mechanisms of habitat filtering. This was reflected in species successional aggregation in adult dung-visiting flies, aggregation of beetle <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> functional groups in succession, sized-based successional patterns of dung-inhabiting beetle predators and, finally, by reflection of successional patterns of dung-emitted volatiles by beetle <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> species' succession. Seasonality follows the mechanisms of niche differentiation among adult <b>flies</b> <b>and</b> beetle predators, while it should rather follow principles of habitat filtering between all beetles <b>and</b> <b>flies...</b>|$|R

The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the federation.

Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E

5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E

5|$|Baker {{proceeded}} {{overseas to}} France on 15 June 1918 and, on arrival the following day, was posted to No.4 Squadron AFC piloting Sopwith Camels. On 23 June, he flew his first operational sortie over the German lines; {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant four days later. On 31 July, Baker was among a formation of seven Camels tasked with carrying out a patrol over German-held territory. The group crossed over into German lines near Nieppe Forrest, <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> towards Estaires. The Camels soon intercepted a formation of seven Fokker D.VIIs, and the entire patrol immediately dived at the German aircraft. In the ensuing melee, Baker managed to force one of the aircraft down to the ground, thus scoring his first aerial victory.|$|E
5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Born in Andrews, South Carolina, Overton took {{an early}} {{interest}} in flying, and attended The Citadel {{for a year}} before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II. Afterward, Overton graduated from West Point and began a career flying the F-84 Thunderjet. In 1952, Overton volunteered to fly in the Korean War <b>and</b> <b>flew</b> 102 missions in an F-84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and flying the F-86 Sabre.

However, he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria for his victories.|$|E
