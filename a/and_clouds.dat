5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E

Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening {{trend in the}} far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east of}} Iceland.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
5|$|Etty put a {{great deal}} of effort into the painting, {{including}} visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with the painting, Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and the painting of the sea <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> is rudimentary in comparison {{with the rest of the}} work.|$|E

The scene includes rocky terrain <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E

The aircraft plant attacked on 27November and 3December was only lightly damaged as high winds <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> prevented accurate bombing. The incendiary raid conducted {{on the night of}} 29/30November by 29 Superfortresses burnt out one tenth of a square mile, and was also judged to be unsuccessful by the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms <b>and</b> <b>clouds,</b> avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
5|$|Karan Singh {{who ruled}} from 1631 to 1639, under the {{suzerainty}} of the Mughals, built the Karan Mahal palace. Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. Anup Singh, who ruled from 1669–98, made substantial {{additions to the}} fort complex, with new palaces and the Zenana quarter (royal dwelling for females). He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup Mahal. Gaj Singh who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon palace). Following him, Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and he lavishly decorated the audience hall (see picture in info box) with glass and lively paintwork. Dungar Singh who reigned from 1872 to 1887 built the Badal Mahal (the weather palace) named so in view of a painting of falling rain <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> (a rare event in arid Bikaner). Ganga Singh who ruled from 1887 to 1943 built the Ganga Niwas Palace, which has towers at the entrance patio. This palace was designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob. Ganga Singh’s son Sadul Singh succeeded his father in 1943 but acceded to the Union of India in 1949. He died in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, and later was extended to Zihuatanejo. Though the National Hurricane Center never forecast it to make landfall, one computer model predicted Carlotta to move ashore; due to the threat, the Mexican government also issued a hurricane watch from Puerto Angel to Zihuatanejo. Outer rainbands and rough surf affected the southwestern coast of Mexico for an extended duration; officials evacuated about 100families in potentially flooded areas of Acapulco as a precaution. Precipitation <b>and</b> <b>clouds</b> were reported in every Mexican state along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in flooding in some areas. No stations in Mexico reported sustained tropical storm force winds; however, Bahías de Huatulco International Airport in Oaxaca reported a wind gust of 44mph (71km/h). Heavy rainfall and rough seas were also reported on Socorro Island.|$|E

40|$|Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Africa {{do make a}} lot of {{contribution}} to the national development of their respective countries. They face a number of challenges, to which a number of literatures have been well documented on, ranging from the adoption of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to e-commerce security. However, little has been documented on the reasons why they are not embracing Big Data <b>and</b> <b>Cloud</b> Computing or if they have embraced it, why are they not growing as they should? Big Data <b>and</b> <b>Cloud</b> Computing when combined, can yield a powerful force that SME businesses can tap into. Big corporations and multinational organizations in the industrialized world are all making use of Big Data <b>and</b> <b>Cloud</b> Computing, except African countries. This paper makes a contribution by highlighting the reasons why SMEs in Africa are not embracing Big Data <b>and</b> <b>Cloud</b> Computing or why they are not reaping the full benefit if they already have embarked on Big Data <b>and</b> <b>Cloud</b> Computing technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{component}} {{placement problem}} involves mapping a component {{to a particular}} location and maximizing component utility in grid <b>and</b> <b>cloud</b> systems. It is also an NP hard resource allocation and deployment problem, so many common grid <b>and</b> <b>cloud</b> computing libraries, such as MPICH and Hadoop, do not address this problem, even though large performance gains can occur by optimizing communications between nodes. This paper provides four contributions to research on the component placement problem for grid <b>and</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments. First, we present the Multi-Agent Distributed Adaptive Resource Allocation (MADARA) toolkit, {{which is designed to}} address grid <b>and</b> <b>cloud</b> allocation <b>and</b> deployment needs. Second, we present a heuristic called the Comparison-based Iteration by Degree (CID) Heuristic, which we use to approximate optimal deployments in MADARA. Third, we analyze the performance of applying the CID Heuristic to approximate common grid <b>and</b> <b>cloud</b> operations, such as broadcast, gather, and reduce. Fourth, we evaluate the results of applying genetic programming mutation to improve our CID Heuristic...|$|R
