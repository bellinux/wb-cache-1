2500|$|While purgatory was disputed by the reformers, the Early Patristic Theologians of the Eastern Church {{taught and}} {{believed}} in [...] "apokatastasis", {{the belief that}} all creation would be restored to the original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation.

Thomas Talbott and [...] both wrote books defending the Early Church view of the unlimited atonement, and the ultimate salvation of all mankind.|$|E

6000|$|The {{religious}} movement which I {{think is}} going on is of a subtler and a deeper sort altogether. Men <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> <b>that</b> human beings are finer than they had supposed. A young man said to me: [...] "Well, I don't know about religion, but I know that my opinion of human nature is about fifty per cent. better than it was." [...] That conclusion has been arrived at by countless thousands. It is a great factor--seeing that the belief {{of the future will}} be belief in the God within; and a frank agnosticism concerning the great [...] "Why" [...] of things. Religion will become the exaltation of self-respect, of what we call the divine in man. [...] "The Kingdom of God" [...] is within you. That belief, old as the hills, and reincarnated by Tolstoi years ago, has come into its own in the war; for it has been clearly proved to be the real faith of modern man, underneath all verbal attempts to assert the contrary. This--the white side of war--is an extraordinarily heartening phenomenon; and if it sent every formal creed in the world packing there would still be a gain to religion.|$|E

50|$|One of Tomasello’s primary {{areas of}} {{research}} is primate cognition. Throughout his academic career Tomasello {{has argued that the}} study of primate cognition can reveal a lot about the relationship between humans and other primates, as well as cognitive science as a whole. He explains that historically, cognitive scientists have not paid close enough attention to the study of primate cognition, when in reality the two are identical in many ways. Tomasello would argue that all researchers have long neglected primate cognition, though more recently it has become an increasingly common field of study. Today, many researchers <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> <b>that</b> the study of primate cognition can reveal significant information about evolutionary changes and adaptations in all primates. Additionally, many researchers <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> <b>that</b> other primates already possess the most basic cognitive processes that humans use. Many of the more advanced processes are unique to humans, though.|$|E

50|$|The main {{characters}} are three best friends — Adam, Bruno and Cameron — {{who live and}} work in Melbourne. Adam is newly single, having come out of a long-term relationship, and is dealing with the dating world {{for the first time in}} a long time. Cameron is the sexual predator of the group, although this role has been somewhat lessened by the fact that his ex-wife Zoe — who left when he had an affair — is now part of the group, and is becoming friends with the women he dates. Bruno is a nurse who has a habit of falling for women who don't care for him, while ignoring the many women who do.

For example, it is still largely unknown where juvenile sea turtles and some year-1 sharks travel. Recent advances in underwater tracking devices are illuminating {{what we know about}} marine organisms that live at great Ocean depths. The information that pop-up satellite archival tags give aids in certain time of the year fishing closures and development of a marine protected area. This data is important to both scientists and fishermen because they <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> <b>that</b> by restricting commercial fishing in one small area they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in a much larger area.|$|E

50|$|All {{libraries}} have {{a mission}} statement, and spoken or unspoken, libraries {{are here to}} improve the condition of mankind. An institution can no longer, in good faith aim to improve the human condition while contributing {{to the destruction of}} the future: Buildings produce about 40% of the dangerous greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere (Anisko & Willoughby, 2006). The environmental debate has evolved. The fact that humans are having a negative impact on the environment is no longer seriously questioned. Now, two questions shape the debate: What is our responsibility to fix it, and {{what can we do to}} fix it? Individuals and private organizations have a right to find their personal answers to those questions, but libraries are an investment in the future of our society. Libraries have a responsibility to not contribute to the destruction of the environment, to educate the people regarding our current situation, and empower them to make a difference. Libraries <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> <b>that</b> their green building gives them a great opportunity to educate the citizenry (Tseng, 2007). As libraries continue to take a more progressive stance on improving the human condition, sustainability will have to be a central theme.|$|E
