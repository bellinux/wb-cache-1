25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Influential {{works of}} the 13th century include those of the British monk Johannes de Sacrobosco ( [...] 1195–1256) and the Italian astrologer Guido Bonatti from Forlì (Italy). Bonatti served the {{communal}} governments of Florence, Siena and Forlì and acted as advisor to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. [...] His astrological text-book Liber Astronomiae ('Book of Astronomy'), written around 1277, was reputed to be [...] "the most important astrological work produced in Latin in the 13th century". Dante Alighieri immortalised Bonatti in his Divine Comedy (early 14th century) by placing him in the eighth Circle of Hell, a place where those who would divine the future are forced to have their heads turned <b>around</b> (<b>to</b> <b>look</b> backwards instead of forwards).|$|E

60|$|Dot and Tot both turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> {{but they}} were too late. A low, gloomy archway was just before them, and as the boat glided into it, the jagged rocks of the roof caught the {{children}} and threw them flat upon {{the bottom of the}} boat.|$|E

In 2005, he said, [...] "If you’re talking about mugging littleold ladies, you don’t say, ‘What’s our target for the rate of mugging little old ladies?’ You say, ‘Mugging little old ladies is bad, and we’re {{going to try to}} {{eliminate}} it.’ You recognize you might not be a hundred per cent successful, but your goal is to eliminate the mugging of little old ladies. And I think we need <b>to</b> eventually come <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> at carbon dioxide emissions the same way.". In 2014, he said, [...] "It is time to stop building things with tailpipes and smokestacks. It is time to stop using the sky as a waste dump for our carbon dioxide pollution." ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{pushed their}} heads above the blue water {{and looked around}} the cave. It was silent and deserted. Floating gently near the spot where they had left it was their own little boat. Cap'n Bill swam to it, took hold of the side, and then turned an inquiring face toward the mermaids. [...] "Climb in," [...] said the Queen. So he pulled himself up and awkwardly tumbled forward into the boat. As he did so, he heard his wooden leg clatter against the seat, and turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it wonderingly.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a curious}} idea for Rectus to have, and the colored {{man who was}} driving us--we went out in style, in a barouche, but I wouldn't {{do that kind of}} thing again without making a bargain beforehand--turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at him as if he}} thought he was a little crazy. Rectus was {{certainly}} in high spirits. There was a sort of change coming over him. His eyes had a sparkle in them that I never saw before. No one could say that he didn't take interest in things now. I think the warm weather had something to do with it.|$|E

50|$|Carther’s ambiguous, multi-layered themes {{serve to}} assist the {{architectural}} environment in defining a sense of place. All of his work addresses, in some way, {{the idea of the}} interdependence of human beings and nature.

60|$|Just then, as Dorothy turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the {{whirling}} mountains, {{she was in}} time to see tiny Trot come {{flying from}} the nearest hill to fall upon the soft grass not a yard away from where she stood. Trot was so dizzy she couldn't stand at first, but she wasn't at all hurt, and presently Betsy came flying to them and would have bumped into the others had they not retreated in time to avoid her. Then, in quick succession, came the Lion, Hank and the Sawhorse, bounding from mountain to mountain to fall safely upon the greensward. Only the Wizard was now left behind, and they waited so long for him that Dorothy began to be worried.|$|E

I don't fall in with your idea that that picture would so everlastingly jolt the art side of the question. George Washington was all right, you know, and nobody could say a word against the angel. I don't think so bad of that group. If you was to give Jupiter a pair of epaulets and a sword, and kind of work the clouds <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a blackberry patch, it wouldn't make such a bad battle scene. Why, if we hadn't already settled on the price, he ought to pay an extra thousand for Washington, and the angel ought to raise it five hundred." ...|$|E
60|$|But Reddy Fox and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and Johnny Chuck and Jimmy Skunk and Happy Jack and Striped Chipmunk couldn't swim, so {{of course}} they couldn't play tag in the water or hide and seek or go down the {{slippery}} slide; all they could do was sit <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> on and wish that {{they knew how to}} swim, too. So of course they didn't have a good time. Soon they began to wish that they hadn't come to Jerry Muskrat's party. When he found that they were not having a good time, poor Jerry Muskrat felt very badly indeed. You see he lives in the water so much that he had quite forgotten that there was anyone who couldn't swim, or he never, never would have invited all the little meadow folks who live on dry land.|$|E

6000|$|I {{scrambled}} up {{the rock and}} around to the eastern end, {{where there was a}} broader space for standing and from which some capital views could be obtained. The sea about the rock was calm, but there was quite a swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing. There were no boats visible. The tide was low, leaving bare the curious caves and headlands along shore, and I secured a number of excellent snapshots. It was now three o'clock. I must wait another hour yet before I could get the best view of the [...] "Hole in the Wall"--a huge, arch-like opening through a jutting headland to the west of me. I went <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it, when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay. This was nothing less than the flat, drifting outward around the point. The swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her loose--and I was a prisoner! At first my only feeling was one of annoyance. Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear. The tide would be high that night. If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned.|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{got close}} up behind Jone, {{and was about}} to make a rush past him, his man turned into a side street. Of course I turned too, and then I put on steam, and, giving a laugh as I turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Jone, I charged on, {{intending}} to stop in a minute and have some fun in hearing what Jone had to say about it; but you may believe, ma'am, that I was amazed when I saw only a little way in front of me the bath-chair stand where we had hired our machines! And all the bath-chair men were standing there with their mouths wide open, staring at a woman running along the street, pulling an old bath-chair man in a bath-chair! For a second I felt like dropping the handle I held and making a rush for {{the front door of the}} hotel, which was right ahead of me; and then I thought, as now I was in for it, it would be a lot better to put a good face on the matter, and not look as if I had done anything I was ashamed of, and so I just slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the Old Hall. Four or five of the bath-chair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party I was pulling, and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle Isham {{pushed his}} stool back {{and started to}} his feet with a noise which woke Plez, who had been soundly {{sleeping}} {{on the other side}} of the fireplace; and striding to the door, the old man went out into the open air. Returning in less than a minute, he put his head into the doorway and addressed the astonished woman who had turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after him.
