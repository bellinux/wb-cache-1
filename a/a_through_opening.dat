40|$|Mounting {{systems for}} {{structural}} members, fastening assemblies thereof, and vibration isolation systems including the same are provided. Mounting systems comprise {{a pair of}} mounting brackets, each clamped against a fastening assembly forming a mounting assembly. Fastening assemblies comprise a spherical rod end comprising a spherical member having <b>a</b> <b>through</b> <b>opening</b> and an integrally threaded shaft, first and second seating members {{on opposite sides of}} the spherical member and each having <b>a</b> <b>through</b> <b>opening</b> that is substantially coaxial with the spherical member through opening, and a partially threaded fastener that threadably engages each mounting bracket forming the mounting assembly. Structural members have axial end portions, each releasably coupled to a mounting bracket by the integrally threaded shaft. Axial end portions are threaded in opposite directions for permitting structural member rotation to adjust a length thereof to a substantially zero strain position. Structural members may be vibration isolator struts in vibration isolation systems...|$|E
40|$|The module has a movable {{vibrator}} head (2) with {{at least}} two plates (6, 8). One plate (8) carries a holder (10) for parts or tools. The two plates are parallel to a base of the vibrator head remote from the workpiece and are driven in oscillation along a longitudinal direction so that the tool holder vibrates in a plane. Each plate has <b>a</b> <b>through</b> <b>opening</b> (18, 20) for a rotary drive connection from the holder to a drive unit (24) {{on the other side of}} the plate from the workpiece. The plate on the workpiece side rotatably encloses the holder. The plates can be positioned wrt. each other and the head base for fine positioning. The positioning and oscillating drives for the plates are each provided by lifting magnets (28, 30) interacting with a sprung return device (36, 38). ADVANTAGE - Compact module can be manufactured efficiently...|$|E
40|$|DE 1004016243 B UPAB: 20050928 NOVELTY - The {{apparatus}} {{includes a}} set of scales (10) and a sample receptacle (20) for the flat body. The receptacle is arranged relative to the scales such that {{the surface of the}} flat body runs vertically into the installation site. The scales are surrounded by a cladding which is not earthed to the scales. The cladding has <b>a</b> <b>through</b> <b>opening</b> for elements of the receptacle. The receptacle has a support for taking a horizontal force acting on the receptacle. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - It also has either a holder for fastening the body, whereby the support contacts the holder and a roller or sliding shoe is provided at the contact point for low friction movement of the holder, or the receptacle has two bearing supports separated by the through opening and to which is fastened a roller for mounting the body. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for : (1) a method of determining weight change, and (2) the use of the apparatus. USE - Used in paint factories to determine the quality of a coating applied to a surface (claimed). ADVANTAGE - Provides a smoother track and more accurate measurement...|$|E

The presented equations are predominantly valid for temperatures above 200 °C and predictions with the equations are shown to be within 10 % of results from computer simulations and experimental measurements.
