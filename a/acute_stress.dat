5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood.

5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion. The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of Litoral Gas to confirm the absence of customer complaints about the gas leak. Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest of Carlos Osvaldo García, an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area. He was captured during the night, and his assistant Pablo Miño surrendered to police the following day. According to witnesses, one employee fled in a van before the explosion, when he realized the severity of the gas leak, while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area. The van belonged to García, who experienced an <b>acute</b> <b>stress</b> reaction during the trial. Curto checked the remnants of the gas employee's workshop to verify García's testimony.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed <b>acute</b> <b>stress</b> reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{evidence}} that perfectionism {{is associated with}} adolescent psychological distress, few studies have investigated this relationship prospectively with measures designed for use in adolescent populations. In the present study, within a diathesis-stress framework, we investigated {{the extent to which}} perfectionism and <b>acute</b> life <b>stress</b> predict depression, anxiety and self-harm among adolescent school children (n = 515) over a 6 month period (Time 1 -Time 2). Socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), self-oriented perfection ism-critical (SOP-critical) and the associated interactions with <b>acute</b> life <b>stress</b> differentially predicted anxiety, depression and self-harm. <b>Acute</b> life <b>stress</b> was an independent predictor of depression, anxiety and self-harm.

BackgroundApical ballooning syndrome is a transient cardiomyopathy that occurs predominantly in post-menopausal women and may be triggered by <b>acute</b> mental <b>stress.</b> The mechanism for ABS is unknown. MethodsReactive hyperemia as a parameter of endothelial function and vascular responses to <b>acute</b> mental <b>stress</b> were measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) at baseline and following 3 <b>acute</b> mental <b>stress</b> tests in female patients with ABS (n = 12, at least 6 months after being hospitalized or diagnosed with ABS), post-menopausal female controls (n = 12), and female patients with myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 4). Plasma catecholamine levels were measured at baseline and following the 3 mental stress tests. ResultsReactive hyperemia PAT scores following mental stress were significantly lower in patients with ABS compared with post-menopausal controls (p < 0. 05). The PAT scores during mental stress were significantly lower in patients with ABS compared with patients with MI and post-menopausal controls (p < 0. 05). There were no differences in PAT scores during <b>acute</b> mental <b>stress</b> in patients with MI versus post-menopausal controls. Furthermore, catecholamine levels were significantly increased in patients with ABS, compared with post-menopausal controls, following <b>acute</b> mental <b>stress</b> testing (p < 0. 05). ConclusionsThere is increased vascular reactivity and decreased endothelial function in response to <b>acute</b> mental <b>stress</b> in patients with a prior episode of ABS.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate global gene expression in testes of the L 2 strain of Taiwan country chicken after <b>acute</b> heat <b>stress.</b> Twelve roosters, 45 weeks old, were allocated into four groups, including control roosters kept at 25 °C, roosters subjected to 38 °C <b>acute</b> heat <b>stress</b> for 4 hours without recovery, with 2 -hour recovery, and with 6 -hour recovery, respectively. Testis samples were collected for RNA isolation and microarray analysis. Based on gene expression profiles, 169 genes were upregulated and 140 genes were downregulated after heat stress using a cutoff value of twofold or greater change. Based on gene ontology analysis, differentially expressed genes were mainly related to response to stress, transport, signal transduction, and metabolism. A functional network analysis displayed that heat shock protein genes and related chaperones were the major upregulated groups in chicken testes after <b>acute</b> heat <b>stress.</b> A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA expressions of HSP 70, HSP 90 AA 1, BAG 3, SERPINB 2, HSP 25, DNAJA 4, CYP 3 A 80, CIRBP, and TAGLN confirmed the results of the microarray analysis.

General discussion. The influence of psychological distress and pain on cognitive outcome following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has received little empirical attention. The current research explored the associations of psychological distress and pain with cognitive functioning in adults following mTBI. A systematic review (Study 1) and two empirical studies (Studies 2 and 3) were undertaken. A systematic review was conducted to identify and evaluate the existing evidence regarding the {{relationship between}} psychological distress and cognitive functioning following mTBI. The search yielded 17 relevant papers. Evaluation of the design and methodology of the studies revealed {{that the quality of}} the evidence was limited. A prospective longitudinal study of consecutive trauma patients suggested lower cognitive performance in the presence of depressive symptoms. In an empirical investigation, 57 consecutive mTBI patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma hospital were recruited. Within 14 days of injury, participants completed self-report measures of <b>acute</b> post-traumatic <b>stress,</b> depression, and pain, and neuropsychological measures of attention, memory, processing speed, reaction time, working memory, and verbal fluency. In Study 2, canonical correlation analyses explored whether <b>acute</b> post-traumatic <b>stress,</b> depression, and pain were related to cognitive performance in a number of domains. <b>Acute</b> post-traumatic <b>stress</b> and pain were significantly associated with speed and accuracy performance on an extended version of the Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test. Study 3 further analyzed performance on this task using repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance. Performance was tested under three conditions of increasing cognitive demand (standard, auditory distraction, and dual-task conditions). <b>Acute</b> post-traumatic <b>stress</b> was associated with lower accuracy while depression was associated with higher accuracy. <b>Acute</b> post-traumatic <b>stress,</b> depression, and pain were associated with differential changes in speed performance as cognitive demands increased.
