Spittoono was held {{in the parking lot of}} the ESSO Club from 1981 to 1990 by which time it had outgrown the available space.

30|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of ‘blind mason’, during its {{addition}} to the tip, GTP-tubulin has to have significant degree of freedom of motion (rotational and translational diffusion) [29]. Therefore, by limiting the <b>accommodating</b> <b>space</b> for free rotation and translation of GTP-tubulin molecule, the highly crowded conditions are in conflict with solving the problem of ‘blind mason’ during microtubule assembly. However, we have shown that crowded conditions in our experiments were not too strong so that the problem of ‘blind mason’ is properly solved.|$|E

40|$|Representing the Cosmopolitan Subaltern” {{identifies}} the precarious condition of slum dwellers in the interstices of neoliberal market forces, state indifference and subaltern cosmopolitanism(s) within which their subject identities are formed, negotiated and represented. Wilson argues that reconstructions of urban subalternity found in fiction and film are {{indebted to the}} methods and discourses of oral history, case study and interview used in anthropological and sociological research on slums. Focusing on the fictionalised accounts of Mumbai’s slum dwellers in Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire (2010) and Katherine Boo’s Behind the Beautiful Forevers (2012), she {{identifies the}} ambiguous positioning of such “slum narratives” in <b>accommodating</b> <b>space</b> for individual agency that defers to the normative conception of rights in the West, while paying {{little attention to the}} collective claims for communal belonging, rights and ownership made by the political community...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of volcanoes to regional tectonic setting and earthquake dynamics is intimate. We know that eruptions are often triggered by earthquakes, and that volcanoes generally lie along or near major faults or within faulted provinces. It has been generally found that bimodal basaltic-rhyolitic volcanism {{is associated with}} extensional settings, presumably because {{of the creation of}} <b>accommodating</b> <b>space.</b> For intermediate arc volca- noes, tectonic settings are generally compressional or transpressional. The spatial pattern of faulting indicates that Long Valley was focussed by a releasing bend in the transtensional, Sierran range-front fault system. The temporal pattern of offset rates suggests that the zone of greatest activity has migrated to the NW through time, and is now focussed at the Mono-Inyo Craters. The southern Mexican volcanic arc presents an example of the coexistence of regional compressional and transpressional structures with volcanoes. On an event basis, slip on regional structures creates opportunities for magma movement and eruption, in a type of dynamic fault pumping of fluids. Both kinematically and dynamically, volcanic activity may be completely dependent on tectonic factors for accumulation, storage and eruption of magma...|$|E

FLO's broad objectives are {{the establishment of a}} permanent human presence on the moon, supporting the utilization of extraterrestrial resources in a long-term, sustained program. The primary objective is to emplace and validate the first elements of a man tended outpost on the lunar surface to provide the basis for: (1) establishing, maintaining and expanding human activities and influence across the surface; (2) establishing, maintaining and enhancing human safety and productivity; (3) <b>accommodating</b> <b>space</b> transportation operations to and from the surface; (4) accommodating production of scientific information; (5) exploiting in-situ resources. Secondary objectives are: (1) to conduct local, small scale science (including life science); (2) In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) demonstrations; (3) engineering and operations tests; (4) to characterize the local environment; and (5) to explore locally. The current work is part of ongoing research at the Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture supporting NASA's First Lunar Outpost initiative. Research at SICSA supporting the First Lunar Outpost initiative has been funded through the Space Exploration Initiatives office at Johnson Space Center.
