5|$|Like Bülow, Bache {{performed}} {{works from}} memory instead of from the printed page, {{at a time}} when doing so was a matter of open debate. <b>Also</b> <b>like</b> Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted entirely to the work of one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he experimented with an all-Beethoven recital.|$|E
5|$|Maymandi {{had a son}} named Abd al-Razzaq Maymandi, {{who also}} gained the vizier office. He also had another son named Sa'id Maymandi, who had a son named Mansur ibn Sa'id who <b>also</b> <b>like</b> Maymandi, {{occupied}} high offices.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{operations}} of Fall Gelb this one most strongly embodied {{the concept of}} a Blitzkrieg as the term was then understood: a Strategischer Überfall or strategic assault. <b>Also,</b> <b>like</b> Fall Gelb as a whole, it involved a high risk strategy.|$|E
50|$|He <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> to {{document}} his experiences through photography.|$|R

5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. <b>Also</b> <b>like</b> the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>Also</b> <b>like</b> Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|<b>Also</b> <b>like</b> her mother, whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} to {{the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel <b>also,</b> <b>like</b> many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Newsom's first {{political}} experience {{came when he}} volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café. In 1996, Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission, and he was later {{elected president of the}} commission. In 1997, Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors and <b>also,</b> <b>like</b> Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They <b>also</b> <b>like</b> using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E

5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Jumping Flash! 2 {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who praised {{the game for}} its updated interface, advanced graphics and gameplay. However, <b>also</b> <b>like</b> its predecessor, it was criticised for its short length, lack of challenging gameplay and close similarities to the first game. Despite this, Jumping Flash! 2 gained enough popularity to spawn a final sequel, Robbit Mon Dieu.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but <b>also</b> <b>like</b> the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due {{to the fact}} that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them {{to the bottom of the}} seafloor with its fins. The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny teeth, with the lower jaw being slightly convex. They <b>also,</b> <b>like</b> most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E
50|$|Potts is a {{supporter}} of Cardiff City FC, but <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> to follow Newcastle United, mainly from afar.|$|R

5|$|The cover art was {{illustrated}} by sci-fi/fantasy artist Michael Whelan, following {{the style of}} Richard Corben's cover for Bat Out of Hell. It features the biker from the first cover flying on his motorcycle towards a giant bat perched on top of New York City's Chrysler Building, to which an angel is bound. Echoing the gravestones of the first cover, partially destroyed skyscrapers inhabit the lava landscape. <b>Also</b> <b>like</b> the first album, it features a 'Songs by Jim Steinman' credit, although smaller and located {{at the bottom of}} the cover.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was <b>also,</b> <b>like</b> St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. <b>Also,</b> <b>like</b> those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. <b>Also</b> <b>like</b> phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. cast 15-year-old Bonita Granville {{to portray}} Nancy, and {{utilized}} the same three-lead system that Torchy Blane used; John Litel portrayed Nancy's father, Carson Drew; and Frankie Thomas portrayed Ned Nickerson, {{whose name was}} changed to Ted to help the series be more up-to-date and mainstream. However, <b>also</b> <b>like</b> Torchy, the series retained several recurring characters: Renie Riano portrayed housekeeper Effie Schneider, while Frank Orth portrayed bumbling police captain, Captain Tweedy. Director William Clemens directed the series, while Torchy Blane writer Kenneth Gamet wrote the screenplays and some original story ideas.|$|E
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. <b>Also</b> <b>like</b> DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
