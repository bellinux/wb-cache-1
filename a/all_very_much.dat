25|$|The {{description}} given {{above is}} taken from males and females of wet-season broods. Specimens of the dry-season broods are paler on the upperside with, in the male only anticiliary black lines to the wings. On the underside the markings on the wings will, on careful examination, be found very similar but paler brown and <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> reduced in width so that a greater extent of the white ground colour is visible.|$|E
60|$|The mess-sergeant fled {{out into}} the {{darkness}} and returned with two troopers and a Corporal, <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> perplexed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Crosbie," [...] he said, [...] "we are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> gratified,--very much gratified, indeed,--by your zeal {{and energy}} in the service." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{procured}} several pine {{sticks and}} soon had them lit, and holding these aloft surveyed the scene. <b>All</b> was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{as it had}} been during their former visit.|$|R
60|$|It is time {{to escape}} from Chowringhi Road and get among the long-shore folk, who have no prejudices against tobacco, and who <b>all</b> use <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{the same sort of}} hat.|$|R
60|$|But I wander from my point, {{which is}} that a clever man or woman among the people whom we call savages is in <b>all</b> {{essentials}} <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{the same as a}} clever man or woman anywhere else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you indeed? I'm after <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{afraid of}} you. Do you think I'm so very easily pleased?" [...] she asked suddenly, {{changing}} her tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Myself, I {{have the}} honour to be Irish, sir. My name is Blood--Captain Peter Blood, {{and this is}} my ship the Arabella, <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at your service.|$|E
6000|$|... "They do say," [...] said Uncle Pentstemon, [...] "one funeral makes many. This time it's a wedding. But it's <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> of a muchness," [...] said Uncle Pentstemon....|$|E
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} sound that he was aiming for, Albarn stated that, [...] "it's <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a modern piece, it's not trying to evoke the time of legend at <b>all.</b> It's <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in sort of {{downtown}} Beijing, Shanghai or Tokyo. It's <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the modern Asia: slightly kooky, very colourful, quite sexy, but still a quite sinister place." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to Church's failed siege, Acadian Rene d'Amour of Aukpacque and Father Simon-Gérard accompanied an expedition of the Maliseet militia, which, although {{one of the}} largest gatherings of natives ever assembled in Acadia, did not, after <b>all,</b> accomplish <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Dane laughed softly. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "tastes differ, and {{the girl}} is pretty, while you know, after <b>all,</b> they're <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same. We have, however, {{got to look at}} the thing sensibly, and you admit you can't deny it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He amused them <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> {{stating that}} an omelet {{for an evening}} meal was [...] "an {{effective}} corrective of tired nerves" [...] and would enable him to sleep soundly all night.|$|E
60|$|Several members {{observed}} that a storm-bound club could not presume to be selective, {{and they were}} <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged to him for such a curious chapter from the domestic histories of the county.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a feeling}} that it is still in the {{dangerous}} stage," [...] he said. [...] "But I will go." [...] He said this in a tone of desperation which amused them <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My lawyers advise that {{it should}} be," [...] he {{answered}} sullenly; [...] "but see here, Ida, you may make your own terms about money. Marriage, after <b>all,</b> is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a matter of bargaining, and I {{am not going to}} stand out about the price." ...|$|R
30|$|Participants {{judged the}} assumed costs for {{fulfilling}} non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims by answering the question, “How cost-intensive would you {{guess it is}} for the airport operator to fulfill this claim?” on a scale from 1 (not at <b>all)</b> to 7 (<b>very</b> <b>much).</b> The perceived sustainability of fulfilling non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims was assessed with the question, “To what degree do you think that fulfilling this claim sustainably enhances the airport operator’s corporate success?” on a scale from 1 (not at <b>all)</b> to 7 (<b>very</b> <b>much).</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am of {{the same}} opinion," [...] said Sheriff Miller. [...] "I think we may <b>all</b> be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable witness out of our way. And chiefly, I think, Mr. Balfour himself might be obliged. For you talk of a third accomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my view) has <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the {{appearance}} of a fourth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And so {{ends the}} romantic history of [...] "Crinoline and Macassar",' said Mrs. Woodward; 'and I am sure, Charley, we are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged {{to you for}} the {{excellent}} moral lessons you have given us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can pass}} {{the night in}} this seat very comfortably, so please don't worry about me. It is warm here, you know, and I won't mind a bit the sitting up. Thank you <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for your kindness, and good-bye. I'll be all right, never fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|My niece knows, and {{she insists}} upon going to London at once. [...] We are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> disturbed. If {{it is not}} troubling you too [...] much when you are passing this way, we should be so {{grateful}} if [...] you would call in for a minute.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to Church's failed siege, Acadian Rene d'Amour of Aukpacque and Father Simon-Gérard accompanied an expedition of the Maliseet militia (who joined Louis de Buade de Frontenac's expedition), which, although {{one of the}} largest gatherings of natives ever assembled in Acadia, did not, after <b>all,</b> accomplish <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nick Hogan of TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing [...] "All in <b>all,</b> I <b>very</b> <b>much</b> enjoyed this episode and I'm more excited than ever {{for the last}} few episodes. They're not pulling any punches and I can't wait to see where it leads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed I did, and Aunt Jane {{was very}} kind, or else I {{should have had}} no comfort at <b>all.</b> Was mamma <b>very</b> <b>much</b> shocked at my {{teaching}} Alexis?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should be}} very glad if you were there. Only don't hurt yourself, or Arthur will be angry; and to have you to nurse {{would be more than}} could be borne. My poor aunt! I think she {{softened}} at the last, and she loved us <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at one time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to see you once more down stairs," [...] said Madeline, as she frankly gave him her hand,--not merely {{touching}} his--"very, very glad. But I do hope you will get stronger before you venture to leave Noningsby. You have frightened us <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> by your terrible accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Ingleby. [...] "Still, I am wiser now, {{and what}} I {{may have to}} suffer {{is no more than}} my desert for believing that any man is {{warranted}} in trying to thrust himself above the station he was meant to occupy. That, however, isn't, after <b>all,</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to the purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gombauld {{looked at}} the {{envelope}} {{and put it in}} his pocket unopened. [...] "Luckily," [...] he said, [...] "it isn't at <b>all</b> important. Thanks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>all</b> the same." ...|$|R
60|$|One day Eva {{made her}} aunt {{cut off a}} lot of her {{beautiful}} hair. Then she called all the slaves together, said good-bye to them, and gave them each a curl of her hair as a keepsake. They <b>all</b> cried <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and said they would never forget her, and would try to be good for her sake.|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{towards him}} with dancing eyes. After <b>all,</b> she was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> of a child. The {{prospect}} of a new gown, now that she permitted herself to think of it, was enthralling.|$|R
60|$|The rescued man wore a {{buckskin}} hunting {{shirt and}} leggins and moccasins {{of the same}} material, <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the worse for wear. The leggins were torn into tatters and the moccasins worn through. His face was pinched with suffering and one arm was bleeding from a gunshot wound near the shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alice is {{a charming}} girl," [...] said Mrs. Grant impressively. [...] "She is a beauty {{and she is}} also sweet and sensible, which beauties are not always. We are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> pleased with Leo's choice. But we have really no more time to spare just now. The wedding is at seven o'clock and it is four already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, George!" [...] {{says the}} little lady. [...] "You'll write and tell Harry {{that we are}} <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> pleased with him. This action at Quebec is a most glorious action; {{and now we have}} turned the French king out of the country, shouldn't be at all {{surprised}} if we set up for ourselves in America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{well for}} you to put on that air of ignorance. You don't suppose that married men can keep matters like this from their wives? I can tell you we <b>all</b> admire, <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> {{the manner in which}} you saved Lieutenant Gordon from having to leave the service. He is a {{favourite}} with us all and, though he seems to have made a great fool of himself, we should all be sorry if he had had to leave us." ...|$|R
6000|$|After a time Flora came down, {{and laying}} some sheets of closely written note-paper before her sister, said, [...] "Here is dear mamma's {{unfinished}} letter to Aunt Flora. Papa says we elder ones are to read it. It is {{a description of}} us <b>all,</b> and <b>very</b> <b>much</b> indeed we ought to learn from it. I shall keep a copy of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Then she disenchanted another girl, {{whom the}} Queen {{addressed}} as Evrose, and afterwards {{a boy named}} Evardo, who was older than his brother Evring. Indeed, the yellow hen kept the good Queen exclaiming and embracing for some time, until five Princesses and four Princes, <b>all</b> looking <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike except for the difference in size, stood in a row beside their happy mother.|$|R
