6000|$|A young bee {{crawled up}} the greasy trampled <b>alighting-board.</b> [...] "Excuse me," [...] she began, [...] "but it's my first honey-flight. Could you kindly {{tell me if}} this is my--" ...|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{left the}} <b>alighting-board,</b> circled once, flung {{herself at the}} lowest branch of the Old Oak, and her little loyal swarm--you could have covered it with a pint mug--followed, hooked, and hung.|$|E
6000|$|A Shadow {{fell across}} the <b>alighting-board</b> as the Bee Master {{and his son}} came by. The Oddities crawled in and a Voice behind a Veil said: [...] "I've {{neglected}} the old Hive too long. Give me the smoker." ...|$|E
60|$|The little grey Wax-moth, pressed {{close in}} {{a crack in}} the <b>alighting-board,</b> had waited this chance all day. She scuttled in like a ghost, and, knowing the senior bees would turn her out at once, dodged into a brood-frame, where youngsters who had not yet seen the winds blow or the flowers nod {{discussed}} life. Here she was safe, for young bees will tolerate any sort of stranger. Behind her came the bee who had been slanged by the Guard.|$|E
60|$|After a {{few days}} the weather changed again and became glorious. Even the Oddities would now join the crowd that hung out on the <b>alighting-board,</b> and would sing of work among the merry, merry {{blossoms}} till an untrained ear might have received it for the hum of a working hive. Yet, in truth, their store-honey had been eaten long ago. They lived {{from day to day}} on the efforts of the few sound bees, while the Wax-moth fretted and consumed again their already ruined wax. But the sound bees never mentioned these matters. They knew, if they did, the Oddities would hold a meeting and ball them to death.|$|E
