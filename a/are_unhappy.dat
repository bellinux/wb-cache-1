5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people <b>are</b> <b>unhappy,</b> and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E

25|$|Over 95% of {{cross-border}} trade {{within the region}} is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to {{other countries in the}} Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.|$|E
25|$|Levi's Stadium has {{received}} some backlash from season ticket holders, who <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> regarding rules that won’t {{allow them to}} print their tickets until 72 hours before the game, making re-sale very difficult. In addition, older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at Levi's Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park, leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience. Levi's Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during early-season afternoon games. The majority of fans are seated {{on the east side}} of the stadium and during these afternoon games, they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs. With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco, it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hot-weather climates. Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games. This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days.|$|E

500|$|Robert California (James Spader) confronts Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{about the}} number of mishaps and blunders made in the office, and gives him a firm {{directive}} to bring them to a stop. With no ideas on how to make this come about, Andy puts it in the hands of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who devises a system to find mistakes made by employees in the office. He programs an [...] "efficiency motivator" [...] that will forward incriminating emails to California if they make five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. The rest of the office <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Dwight's system, and call it a doomsday device. Despite their best efforts, the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.|$|E

And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them...

500|$|A similar {{perspective}} was {{favored by}} [...] "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter". Here, the theme echoes Cinderella, but, according to Călinescu, the rural setting provides {{a sharp contrast}} to the classical motif. Persecuted by her stepmother and stepsister, the kind and loving daughter of the old man is forced into a position of servitude reflecting the plight of many peasant women in Creangă's lifetime. In this case, the old man is negatively depicted as cowardly and entirely dominated by his mean wife. The focal point of the narrative is the meeting between the good daughter and Holy Sunday. The latter notices and generously rewards the girl's helpful nature and mastery of cooking; in contrast, when her envious sister attempts the same and fails, she ends up being eaten by serpent-like creatures (balauri). The happy ending sees the good girl marrying not Prince Charming, but a simple man described as [...] "kind and industrious"—this outcome, Călinescu assessed, did not in effect spare the old man's daughter from a life of intense labor. A story very similar to [...] "The Old Man's Daughter..." [...] is [...] "The Purse a' Tuppence", which teaches that greed can shatter families, while offering symbolic retribution to men who <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> in marriage. The old man's rooster, chased away by the old woman for being unproductive, ends up amassing a huge fortune, which he keeps inside his belly and regurgitates back into the courtyard; the jealous old woman ends up killing her favorite hen, who has failed in replicating the rooster's feat.|$|E
