5000|$|From {{the early}} twentieth century, the <b>anthophyte</b> {{hypothesis}} was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperms. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the [...] "anthophytes". [...] Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short cambial initials, and lignin syringal groups. However, most genetic studies have rejected the <b>anthophyte</b> hypothesis. Several of these {{studies have suggested that}} the gnetophytes and angiosperms have independently derived characters, including flower-like reproductive structures and tracheid vessel elements, that appear shared but are actually the result of parallel evolution.|$|E

50|$|In the gnetifer hypothesis, the gnetophytes are {{sister to}} the conifers, and the {{gymnosperms}} are a monophyletic group, sister to the angiosperms.

It did not gain strong support, however, until the emergence of molecular data in the late 1990s. Although the most salient morphological evidence still largely supports the <b>anthophyte</b> hypothesis, there are some more obscure morphological commonalities between the gnetophytes and conifers that {{lend support to the}} gnetifer hypothesis.

40|$|The floristic {{exploration}} of the eastern slopes of the Madonie Mountains in Sicily, carried out between 1975 and 1980, resulted in the discovery of several hydromorphic environments characterized by a thick peaty horizon. Locally named “margiu” or “triemula”, depending on the lower or higher depth, they host plant communities characterized by some species of Juncus and Carex together with acidophilous bryophytes including some species of Sphagnum. Their ecology {{as well as their}} flora and vegetation have been studied (Petronici et al. 1978). In some localities fossil pollens have also been examined (Bertolani Marchetti et al. 1984). Floristic analyses pointed out some phytogeographical patterns (Raimondo & Dia 1978, Raimondo et al. 1980, Raimondo et al. 1981). These data primarily provide the key lecture of some taxa in relation to glacial expansion in the Mediterranean Basin. New floristic data have been reported (Marcenò & Raimondo 1977, Raimondo 1979), and further unpublished data came out during following collections and surveys on the conservation status of this habitat, mostly destroyed by the drainage produced after the gathering up of mineral waters (Raimondo & Spadaro 2003). On the basis of previously collected data and herbarium specimens housed in Palermo (PAL), combined with more recent observations, a survey of the peat flora of the Madonie (<b>Anthophytes,</b> Pteridophytes and Bryophytes) is reported.

40|$|SummaryThe great {{evolutionary}} {{success of}} angiosperms {{has traditionally been}} explained, in part, by the partnership of these plants with insect pollinators [1 – 6]. The main approach to understanding the origins of this pervasive relationship has been study of the pollinators of living cycads, gnetaleans, and basal angiosperms [7]. Among the most morphologically specialized living pollinators are diverse, long-proboscid flies. Early such flies include the brachyceran family Zhangsolvidae, previously known only as compression fossils from the Early Cretaceous of China and Brazil. It belongs to the infraorder Stratiomyomorpha, a group that includes the flower-visiting families Xylomyidae and Stratiomyidae. New zhangsolvid specimens in amber from Spain (ca. 105 mega-annum [Ma]) and Myanmar (100 Ma) reveal a detailed proboscis structure adapted to nectivory. Pollen clumped on a specimen from Spain is Exesipollenites, attributed to a Mesozoic gymnosperm, most likely the Bennettitales. Late Mesozoic scorpionflies with a long proboscis have been proposed as specialized pollinators of various extinct gymnosperms, but pollen has never been observed on or in their bodies [8]. The new discovery is a very rare co-occurrence of pollen with its insect vector and provides substantiating evidence that other long-proboscid Mesozoic insects were gymnosperm pollinators. Evidence is thus now gathering that visitors and probable pollinators of early <b>anthophytes,</b> or seed plants, involved some insects with highly specialized morphological adaptations, which has consequences for interpreting the reproductive modes of Mesozoic gymnosperms and the significance of insect pollination in angiosperm success...|$|R
40|$|Sequences of two {{chloroplast}} photosystem genes, psaA and psbB, together comprising about 3, 500 bp, {{were obtained}} for all five major groups of extant seed plants and several outgroups among other vascular plants. Strongly supported, but significantly conflicting, phylogenetic signals were obtained in parsimony analyses from partitions of the data into first and second codon positions versus third positions. In the former, both genes agreed on a monophyletic gymnosperms, with Gnetales closely related to certain conifers. In the latter, Gnetales are inferred to be the sister group of all other seed plants, with gymnosperms paraphyletic. None of the data supported the modern ‘‘anthophyte hypothesis,’’ which places Gnetales as the sister group of flowering plants. A series of simulation studies were undertaken to examine the error rate for parsimony inference. Three kinds of errors were examined: random error, systematic bias (both properties of finite data sets), and statistical inconsistency owing to long-branch attraction (an asymptotic property). Parsimony reconstructions were extremely biased for third-position data for psbB. Regardless of the true underlying tree, a tree in which Gnetales are sister to all other seed plants {{was likely to be}} reconstructed for these data. None of the combinations of genes or partitions permits the <b>anthophyte</b> tree to be reconstructed with high probability. Simulations of progressively larger data sets indicate the existence of long-branch attraction (statistical inconsistency) for third-position psbB data if either the <b>anthophyte</b> tree or the gymnosperm tree is correct. This is also true for the <b>anthophyte</b> tree using either psaA third positions or psbB first and second positions. A factor contributing to bias and inconsistency is extremely short branches {{at the base of the}} seed plant radiation, coupled with extremely high rates in Gnetales and nonseed plant outgroups. M.

40|$|This is {{an initial}} study using the gene {{encoding}} the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB 1) to elucidate evolutionary relationships among ten land plants. This {{is the first}} study to use a single nuclear protein-coding gene to examine seed plant evolution. Results show RPB 1 to contain no base compositional bias and to evolve at a conservative rate that is similar in most species studied here. This gene also exists as a single copy in most species and contains enough phylogenetically informative sites to resolve all relationships among the seed plants in this study. Maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analyses all generate identical tree topologies with similar support values at each node. The angiosperms are a monophyletic clade comprised of Nymphaea as the most basal angiosperm, followed by Magnolia, then Arabidopsis and a monophyletic monocot clade containing maize and Oryza. The gymnosperms also form a monophyletic clade with Welwitschia and pine grouped together and sister to a Cycad and Zamia clade. These findings concur with recent studies that refute the <b>Anthophyte</b> theory and place Nymphaea near {{the root of the}} angiosperm tree. The RPB 1 sequence shows great promise to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among plants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor decades, Gnetales {{appeared}} to be closely related to angiosperms, the two groups together forming the <b>anthophyte</b> clade. At present, molecular studies negate such a relationship and give strong support for a systematic position of Gnetales within or near conifers. However, previous interpretations of the male sporangiophores of Gnetales as pinnate with terminal synangia conflict with a close relationship between Gnetales and conifers. Therefore, we investigated the morphogenesis of the male reproductive structures of Welwitschia mirabilis and Ephedra distachya by SEM and light microscopy. The occurrence of reduced apices to both halves of the antherophores of W. mirabilis gives {{strong support for the}} assumption that the male ‘flowers’ of W. mirabilis represent reduced compound cones. We assume that each half of the antherophore represents a lateral male cone that has lost its subtending bract. Although both halves of the antherophores of Ephedra distachya lack apical meristems, the histological pattern of the developing antherophores supports interpreting them as reduced lateral male cones as well. Therefore, the male sporangiophores of Gnetales represent simple organs with terminal synangia. Although extant conifers do not exhibit terminal synangia, similar sporangiophores are reported for some Cordaitales, the hypothetical sister group of conifers. Moreover, several Paleozoic conifers exhibit male cones with terminal sporangia or synangia. Therefore, we propose that conifers, Cordaitales and Gnetales originated from a common ancestor that displayed simple sporangiophores with a terminal cluster of sporangia...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} the angiosperms (flowering plants sensu stricto) is still enigmatic. Answers {{to the question of}} angiosperm origins are intimately connected to the identification of their sister group among extinct and extant taxa. Most phylogenetic analyses based on morphological data agree that among the groups of extant seed plants, the gnetophytes are the sister group of the angiosperms. According to this view, angiosperms and gnetophytes are the only extant members of a clade called “anthophytes” to emphasize their shared possession of flower-like reproductive structures. However, most phylogeny reconstructions based on molecular data so far did not support an <b>anthophyte</b> clade, but also could not clarify the case because support for alternative groupings has been weak or controversial. We have isolated 13 different homologs of MADS-type floral homeotic genes from the gnetophyte Gnetum gnemon. Five of these genes fall into monophyletic gene clades also comprising putatively orthologous genes from flowering plants and conifers, among them orthologs of floral homeotic B and C function genes. Within these clades the Gnetum genes always form distinct subclades together with the respective conifer genes, to the exclusion of the angiosperm genes. This provides strong molecular evidence for a sister-group relationship between gnetophytes and conifers, which is in contradiction to widely accepted interpretations of morphological data for almost a century. Our phylogeny reconstructions and the outcome of expression studies suggest that complex features such as flower-like reproductive structures and double-fertilization arose independently in gnetophytes and angiosperms...|$|E
40|$|The {{phylogeny}} of land plants, especially angiosperms, {{has been}} perplexing scientists {{for more than}} 125 years. The {{aim of this study}} was to help elucidate unanswered phylogenetic issues using rpb 1 genes from twenty-six land plant species (8 gymnosperm species, 17 angiosperm species and Psilotum, a fernally, as the outgroup). The sixteen rpb 1 genes which were sequenced in this study had very similar lengths and contained no base compositional bias. Synonymous substitutions of rpb 1 sequences were saturated when compared to the outgroup. The third codon positions of these genes contained misleading phylogenetic information. The topology of trees based on first and second codon positions were in line with that of protein trees. Both angiosperms and gymnosperms were monophyletic. Amborella was found at the base of the angiosperm tree, followed by Nymphae, then Illicium. These data rejected the <b>anthophyte</b> hypothesis, weakly supported the gnepine hypothesis, but did not resolve the interrelationship among eumagnoliids and eudicots. rpb 1 genes were combined with the 18 S ribosomal RNA gene and chloroplast atpB and rbcL genes to obtain more robust phylogenies. This combined data set produced a topology similar to that of the first and second positions of rpb 1 genes except that they better resolved the interrelationship among eumagnoliids and eudicots. We conclude that our rpb 1 sequences evolve too slowly to provide enough phylogenetic information to fully resolve the phylogeny of seed plants and that other gene sequences will need to be added to these data sets to obtain a well-resolved phylogenetic tree of seed plants...|$|E
40|$|Efforts {{to resolve}} Darwin's “abominable mystery”—the origin of angiosperms—have {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that Gnetales and various fossil groups are sister to angiosperms, forming the “anthophytes. ” Morphological homologies, however, are difficult to interpret, and molecular data have not provided clear resolution of relationships among major groups of seed plants. We introduce two sequence data sets from slowly evolving mitochondrial genes, cox 1 and atpA, which unambiguously reject the <b>anthophyte</b> hypothesis, favoring instead a close relationship between Gnetales and conifers. Parsimony- and likelihood-based analyses of plastid rbcL and nuclear 18 S rDNA alone and with cox 1 and atpA also strongly support a gnetophyte–conifer grouping. Surprisingly, three of four genes (all but nuclear rDNA) and combined three-genome analyses also suggest or strongly support Gnetales as derived conifers, sister to Pinaceae. Analyses with outgroups screened to avoid long branches consistently identify all gymnosperms as a monophyletic sister group to angiosperms. Combined three- and four-gene rooted analyses resolve the branching order for the remaining major groups—cycads separate from other gymnosperms first, followed by Ginkgo and then (Gnetales + Pinaceae) sister to a monophyletic group with all other conifer families. The molecular phylogeny strongly conflicts with current interpretations of seed plant morphology, and implies that many similarities between gnetophytes and angiosperms, such as “flower-like” reproductive structures and double fertilization, were independently derived, whereas other characters could emerge as synapomorphies for an expanded conifer group including Gnetales. An initial angiosperm–gymnosperm split implies a long stem lineage preceding the explosive Mesozoic radiation of flowering plants and suggests that angiosperm origins and homologies should be sought among extinct seed plant groups...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Welwitschia mirabilis is {{the only}} extant {{member of the family}} Welwitschiaceae, one of three {{lineages}} of gnetophytes, an enigmatic group of gymnosperms variously allied with flowering plants or conifers. Limited sequence data and rapid divergence rates have precluded consensus on the evolutionary placement of gnetophytes based on molecular characters. Here we report on the first complete gnetophyte chloroplast genome sequence, from Welwitschia mirabilis, as well as analyses on divergence rates of protein-coding genes, comparisons of gene content and order, and phylogenetic implications. Results The chloroplast genome of Welwitschia mirabilis [GenBank: EU 342371] is comprised of 119, 726 base pairs and exhibits large and small single copy regions and two copies of the large inverted repeat (IR). Only 101 unique gene species are encoded. The Welwitschia plastome is the most compact photosynthetic land plant plastome sequenced to date; 66 % of the sequence codes for product. The genome also exhibits a slightly expanded IR, a minimum of 9 inversions that modify gene order, and 19 genes that are lost or present as pseudogenes. Phylogenetic analyses, including one representative of each extant seed plant lineage and based on 57 concatenated protein-coding sequences, place Welwitschia at the base of all seed plants (distance, maximum parsimony) or as the sister to Pinus (the only conifer representative) in a monophyletic gymnosperm clade (maximum likelihood, bayesian). Relative rate tests on these gene sequences show the Welwitschia sequences to be evolving at faster rates than other seed plants. For these genes individually, a comparison of average pairwise distances indicates that relative divergence in Welwitschia ranges from amounts about equal to other seed plants to amounts almost three times greater than the average for non-gnetophyte seed plants. Conclusion Although the basic organization of the Welwitschia plastome is typical, its compactness, gene content and high nucleotide divergence rates are atypical. The current lack of additional conifer plastome sequences precludes any discrimination between the gnetifer and gnepine hypotheses of seed plant relationships. However, both phylogenetic analyses and shared genome features identified here are consistent with either of the hypotheses that link gnetophytes with conifers, but are inconsistent with the <b>anthophyte</b> hypothesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{union of}} {{molecular}} biology and evolutionary biology in addressing questions regarding the evolution of organisms and their genes. This project focuses on major groups of seed plants (angiosperms, and four gymnosperms groups: conifers, cycads, Ginkgo and Gnetales). These organisms diverged roughly three hundred million years ago and evolved independently since then. Therefore, morphological characters have limited power in resolving their phylogeny. With the advancement of molecular methods, sequences of genes {{have been widely used}} in addressing evolutionary relationships. Plant molecular phylogenies have been traditionally done using chloroplast gene rbcL and nuclear rRNA genes. While these molecular markers revolutionized plant systematics, they do not contain enough phylogenetic information to resolve the phylogeny of seed plants. I used normalized splits, as a measure from spectral analysis, in examining data sets and identifying genes and sites within genes that are more reliable for building phylogenies and combining data sets. I used the genes encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I, II and III (rpa 1, rpb 1 and rpc 1, respectively) as a new line of evidence from the nuclear genome to address seed plant phylogeny. These protein-coding genes refute the <b>Anthophyte</b> hypothesis (which relates Gnetales and angiosperms) and support the Gnepines hypothesis (which places Gnetales within conifers as a sister group to Pinaceae). I also examined other available data sets from chloroplast, mitochondrial and 18 S rRNA genes. A combined data set of RNA polymerases and seven other genes strongly support the Gnepines hypothesis. Other branches of seed plant phylogeny are also well supported using this data set. Angiosperms and gymnosperms form monophyletic groups, cycads are at the base of gymnosperms, followed by Ginkgo and a branch leading to conifers and Gnetales. I also studied the rate and pattern of molecular evolution of rpa 1, rpb 1 and rpc 1 genes. A gene phylogeny of these genes strongly support that they share a common ancestor and that rpb 1 and rpc 1 are closer to one another than either are to rpa 1. The pattern of functional constraint in these genes clearly follows known structural properties of the RNA polymerases. Evolutionary rate analyses show that rpa 1 evolves more rapidly at non-synonymous sites and at the amino acid level, followed by rpc 1 and rpb 1. Interestingly, the evolutionary rate of these genes (and the proteins they encode) is positively related to the amount of concerted evolution in the genes transcribed by each RNA polymerase. This suggests a possible impact of concerted evolution (generated by recombination) on the molecular evolution of the largest subunit of RNA polymerases...|$|E
