5|$|Back in Egypt, {{and after}} {{a short period of}} rest, Kippenberger set about {{rebuilding}} the battalion, which had lost over half its original complement. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers continued to arrive for several weeks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Mediterranean in small sailboats. By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E

50|$|Sowells was {{selected}} by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round (112th overall) in the 2006 NFL Draft. Sowells was released by the Browns on September 4, 2009 <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> final roster cuts.|$|R
5|$|The 20th Battalion was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{having lost}} over half its original complement of personnel during the Greece and Crete campaigns. After {{a short period}} of rest, Kippenberger set about bringing the battalion back up to strength. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers, separated from the battalion for various reasons during the previous two months while in Greece and Crete, continued to arrive for several weeks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Mediterranean by various means, including small sailboats. By mid-June, the battalion was at full strength and several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{entered the}} village by 16:30. Lieutenant Colonel Borislav Đukić, {{in command of}} the Tactical Group-1 tasked with capture of Kijevo and the {{commanding}} officer of the JNA 221st Motorised Infantry Brigade, reported that the village was secured by 22:30. The Croatian police fled Kijevo in three groups via Mount Kozjak towards Drniš. The remaining Croatian population left after the artillery had destroyed much of their settlements. The retreating groups were pursued by the Yugoslav Air Force jets <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Kozjak. Radio Television Belgrade reporter Vesna Jugović recorded these events. Krajina units commanded by Martić acted in concert with JNA to take command of the area.|$|E
5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to the dressing room.|$|E
5000|$|The masque {{has been}} described, {{somewhat}} romantically, {{as a work}} of [...] "fragile, transient loveliness," [...] featuring [...] "noble dancers in their crimson satin and white, with herons' feathers waving and jewels flashing, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> graceful movements in the torchlight." ...|$|R

60|$|Several of {{the sailors}} were very drunk, {{and one of}} them was lifted on board insensible by his landlord, who carried him down below and dumped him into a bunk.

5|$|The rest of {{the advance}} party of the Alsos Mission moved to Normandy in August 1944, where it joined T-Force, a similar {{formation}} to S-Force, at Rambouillet, where it was preparing for the liberation of Paris. An Alsos Mission team including Pash and Calvert reached Joliot-Curie's house in the Paris suburbs on 24 August to find {{that he was not}} there, but at his laboratory at the Collège de France. The next day they reached the Porte d'Orléans where they encountered troops of the French 2e Division Blindée, who were engaged in liberating the city, and came under small arms fire from the German defenders. The Alsos Mission replied with their M1 carbines and Thompson submachine guns <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> through the back streets to the college, where they found Joliot-Curie in his office.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
25|$|In 1537, {{during the}} Third Ottoman–Venetian War, Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent {{dispatched}} {{a force of}} 25,000 men {{under the command of}} admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa to attack Corfu. The Ottomans landed at Govino Bay, present day Gouvia, and proceeded toward Corfu town, destroying the village of Potamos <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> toward the City.|$|E
50|$|However, Gayles {{managed to}} swim {{back to the}} boat and, despite Woods calls to beat the gang leader's {{knuckles}} with the oar; Mahoney pulled Gayles back on however, he soon died {{and the two men}} once again threw him over the side <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> escape. His body was found floating in the harbor four days later.|$|R
50|$|The Rocka Rolla Tour was {{a concert}} tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest {{which was in}} support of their debut album Rocka Rolla. It ran from 10 September 1974 until 28 December 1975.

25|$|On 7 November, {{a survey}} {{was due to}} be {{undertaken}} to establish {{the boundaries of the}} cemetery land. The police had learned that a demonstration was planned for that morning at the cemetery, so at six o'clock in the morning, Police Commissioner Espiau went to the cemetery with 150 officers, and found some 2,000 people already gathered there near the gates. A small number of people were arrested for obstructing the police <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to the cemetery. Although posters calling people to defend the cemetery had been put up across the city, most of the demonstrators who gathered on 7 November were local people who lived near the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Northamptonshire Steelbacks had set {{a target}} of 283 when rain intervened at Sophia Gardens. Having been put in to bat by Glamorgan Dragons' captain Robert Croft, they got {{themselves}} to 155 for 2 thanks to fifties from Usman Afzaal and David Sales, and to finish the innings off Bilal Shafayat and Riki Wessels recorded scores at run rates higher than six an over. Wessels spent 20 deliveries for his unbeaten 43, while Shafayat got a run-a-ball 31. For Glamorgan, Alex Wharf got three wickets, but conceded 71 runs from nine overs, while Andrew Davies was almost as expensive with 53 from eight overs, but took four wickets. Glamorgan saw off 33 balls from Northamptonshire in chase of 283 to win, losing Croft for 1 <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to 22 for 1, but rain then {{put an end to}} play and Glamorgan took two points from the game.|$|E
25|$|However, Gloucestershire bowled {{with more}} effect {{the second time}} around, Malinga Bandara taking four for 85 in a {{marathon}} 37-over spin bowling effort. Rudge repaired his golden duck, taking a wicket with his first ball of the innings to remove Mark Wallace for another golden duck. However, Rudge was taken for 36 in a six-over spell, and never returned to bowl. Dean Cosker top scored for Glamorgan with 52 from number seven <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to 290, setting Gloucestershire a target of 540 to win - {{which would have been}} a first class record chase. Ramnaresh Sarwan attempted it, hitting out well after Kadeer Ali had been dismissed, but he was eventually bowled by Huw Waters for 54. Gloucestershire succumbed to 184 for 5 at stumps, needing to survive another day for the draw. Wharf spoiled that, though, taking four wickets on the fourth morning as Gloucestershire crawled to 217 and a 322-run defeat.|$|E
5000|$|The Bulldogs were {{champions of}} the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association for the second {{straight}} year. [...] The Red Cats were 48-6-2 in the six year tenure of Coach Bill Edwards, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> first ever bowl game. The Red Cats were {{champions of the}}ir regional Ohio league, Big Four Conference, six of the last seven seasons.|$|R
60|$|The news {{spread like}} {{wildfire}} among the troops, {{and there was}} at once a general rush to the spot. The boys were seized in an instant, and each raised {{on the shoulders of}} two of the grenadiers, and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> appearance above the heads of the crowd a tremendous cheer broke from the whole regiment.|$|R
60|$|In {{the hall}} and {{adjacent}} rooms all manner of cloaking and shawling was going on, and the Barchester folk were getting themselves gone.

By slow degrees the guests went.|$|R
25|$|Outstanding {{figures of}} 10-6-10-4 from Bermuda's T Burgess kept Israel's total {{down to a}} measly 86, and Winston Reid plundered 63 not out as the Bermudians raced to their target in under 14 overs {{for the loss of}} just one wicket. Paul Prashad hit an unbeaten 164 for Canada <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to 356/6, ably {{supported}} by D Singh (65). Papua New Guinea showed fight in their response, Karo Ao (67) and Taunao Vai (51) compiling an opening stand of 126, but then F Waithe (4-37) reduced them to 133/4 {{and there was no way}} back; Derick Etwaroo took 4-64 and PNG ended on 267/9. Future Woking F.C. FA Cup hero Tim Buzaglo made 88 for Gibraltar as they reached 185/8, but 55 from E Vakausausa made sure of victory for Fiji (187/4). And Bakker took 5-20 as the USA slid to 88 all out and a ten-wicket loss to the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Williams also {{reached the}} semifinals of the Tier I Tennis Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells, California, where she {{controversially}} defaulted her match with sister Serena {{just before the}} match started. Venus had been suffering from knee tendinitis throughout the tournament and eventually this prevented her from playing. The following day, Venus and her father Richard were booed <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to their seats to watch the final. Serena was subsequently booed during the final with Kim Clijsters and during the trophy presentation. Due to this, neither Williams sister entered the tournament for 14 years, with Serena entering in 2015 after appeals for forgiveness from the event and the WTA Tour. Venus rebounded from the Indian Wells 'boycott' controversy to win the next tournament on the tour calendar, the Tier I Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida. She defeated Hingis in the semifinals and World No. 4 Jennifer Capriati in the final, after saving eight championship points. Because of this victory, her ranking rose to a career high of World No. 2.|$|E
500|$|Washburn was {{a popular}} and {{dedicated}} teacher.

50|$|July 21, 1961: Flight 779, a Douglas DC-6A (N6118C) {{operating}} Seattle-Shemya crashed {{short of}} the runway, killing the six crew. The cause of the crash {{was due to the}} fact that the power to the runway and approach lighting systems had been cut off two days earlier, and the control tower neglected to inform the pilots <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> approach in the dark.|$|R
50|$|The early-to-mid 1980s saw the US Hot Rod Association host Truck and Tractor Sled Pull Competitions and Monster Truck {{exhibitions}} here. The engines {{on some of}} {{the vehicles}} would echo through the skyscrapers in downtown Chicago <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> pull. Damage to the stadium turf on a few of the event occasion's led USHRA to move events to the Rosemont Horizon (known today as Allstate Arena).|$|R

500|$|Many 20th-century {{historians have}} {{stressed}} the potential military strength of Castle Rising; R. Allen Brown, for example, concluded that [...] "defence... was the overwhelming consideration in [...] design and construction", {{and argued that}} the keep would {{have been used as}} a final refuge in the case of attack during a siege. Beric Morley and David Gurney believe that the military strength of the castle could not have failed to impress contemporaries. Sidney Toy suggested that the forebuilding would have made an effective defensive feature, enabling the defenders to attack intruders <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> up the stairs, with Morley and Gurney describing it as [...] "a deadly and near impregnable approach to the castle's interior".|$|E
500|$|From the outset, {{the weather}} was wet and stormy, with mountainous seas that {{constantly}} threatened to overwhelm the boat. When the sun appeared, Bligh noted in his daily journal that it [...] "gave us as much pleasure as a winter's day in England". Bligh endeavoured to continue his journal throughout the voyage, observing, sketching, and charting <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> west. To keep up morale, he told stories of his prior experiences at sea, got the men singing, and occasionally said prayers. The launch made the first passage by Europeans through the Fiji Islands, but they dared not stop because of the islanders' reputation for cannibalism. On 17 May, Bligh recorded that [...] "our situation was miserable; always wet, and suffering extreme cold... without the least shelter from the weather".|$|E
5000|$|... 1 October: John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O’Meally, and two Mount Macquarie lads, John Vane and Micky Burke, {{held up a}} jeweller’s {{shop and}} the Sportsman’s Arms Hotel in Bathurst in broad daylight. They {{exchanged}} shots with police <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> escape down George Street. Three days later they returned to rob more stores, houses, and hotels {{on the outskirts of}} the town.|$|R
60|$|But {{we wanted}} an anchor, {{and if we}} had had an anchor, {{we could not have}} made a cable; so we {{contented}} ourselves with making some ropes {{with the help of the}} natives, of such stuff <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> mats of, and with these we made such a kind of cable or tow-line as was sufficient to fasten our vessel to the shore, which we contented ourselves with for that time.|$|R
60|$|After {{two days}} of travel there was a yellow sunset, and the snow gleamed in the lurid light with an ominous brilliance, while <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> fire a moaning wind got up. These things presaged {{a change in the}} weather, and they were rather silent over the evening meal. They missed the {{half-breed}} and the snarling dogs, and it looked as if the good fortune that had so far attended them were coming to an end.|$|R
