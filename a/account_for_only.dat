A {{little more than half}} of the population is under 17.7 years of age and the 15 and under population is 43.6%.

5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Women have a {{key role}} in Trinidadian demographics. While women <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 49% of the population, they {{constitute}} nearly 55% of the workforce in the country.|$|E
25|$|In the far southeastern {{corner of}} Massachusetts, the Barnstable Town NECTA, nearly coterminous with the summer resort region of Cape Cod, has an {{atypical}} employment structure. It {{has the lowest}} share of employment in goods-producing jobs, which <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 9.5% of its employment. Most of these jobs are in the construction sector. Manufacturing jobs <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 3.3% of employment, compared with 9.6% for {{the state as a}} whole. On the other hand, the Cape Cod NECTA has the state’s highest percentages of employment in retail trade (17.9%, versus 11.1% for the state) and in leisure and hospitality (16.9%, versus 9.1% for the state). These numbers reflect the continuing importance to Cape Cod of summer tourism.|$|E

25|$|Saint Nicolas de Bourgueil {{produces}} both {{red wine}} and rosé wines though rosés usually <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> about 2% of the production.

25|$|The {{other major}} centers of {{employment}} in Massachusetts are the Springfield and Worcester NECTAs. The Springfield NECTA accounts for {{slightly more than}} 10% of the jobs in Massachusetts, while the Worcester NECTA accounts for slightly less than 10% of the state’s jobs. (Although both of these NECTAs extend into Connecticut, the towns that they include in Connecticut <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> {{a small portion of}} their population and, probably, of their employment).|$|E
25|$|British North America (present-day Canada), where {{slavery was}} prohibited, {{was a popular}} destination, as its long border gave many points of access. Most former slaves settled in Ontario. More than 30,000 people {{were said to have}} escaped there via the network during its 20-year peak period, {{although}} U.S. Census figures <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 6,000. Numerous fugitives' stories are documented in the 1872 book The Underground Railroad Records by William Still, an abolitionist who then headed the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee.|$|E
25|$|Correlations between {{programming}} {{errors and}} production defects unveil that basic code errors account for 92% {{of the total}} errors in the source code. These numerous code-level issues eventually count for only 10% of the defects in production. Bad software engineering practices at the architecture levels <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 8% of total defects, but consume over half the effort spent on fixing problems, and lead to 90% of the serious reliability, security, and efficiency issues in production.|$|E

25|$|There are an {{estimated}} 19,000-20,000 human protein-coding genes. The estimate {{of the number of}} human genes has been repeatedly revised down from initial predictions of 100,000 or more as genome sequence quality and gene finding methods have improved, and could continue to drop further. Protein-coding sequences <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> a very small fraction of the genome (approximately 1.5%), and the rest is associated with non-coding RNA molecules, regulatory DNA sequences, LINEs, SINEs, introns, and sequences for which as yet no function has been determined.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a major Christmas tree growing region, Douglas-fir {{has always}} been the primary species grown. A full {{one-half}} of all trees produced in the Pacific Northwest are Douglas-fir. Douglas-firs typically take five to seven years before they are mature enough to sell as Christmas trees. Also common in the region are noble fir, a tree which commands a higher price than Douglas-fir, and grand fir, which accounts for about 10percent of the annual harvest in the Northwest. Other species collectively <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 3–5percent of the total Northwest harvest.|$|E
25|$|The British {{military}} traditionally dominated Gibraltar's economy, {{with the}} naval dockyard providing {{the bulk of}} economic activity. This, however, has diminished over the last 20 years, and is estimated to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 7 percent of the local economy, compared to over 60 percent in 1984. Today, Gibraltar's economy is dominated by four main sectors: financial services, online gambling, shipping, and tourism, which includes retail sales to visitors. The territory also has a small manufacturing sector, with one company supplying ambulances produced from converted SUV vehicles to the United Nations and other agencies.|$|E

25|$|India's economy {{benefited from}} recent high {{economic}} growth which declined greatly {{due to the}} global economic crisis. Economic growth in India during FY2008-09 stood at 6.7%. The global crisis had less impact of India because exports <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 15% of India's GDP, {{less than half the}} levels of major Asian economic powers such as China and Japan. However, unlike other major Asian economies, India's government finances were in poor shape and as a consequence, it was not able to enact large-scale economic stimulus packages. Despite this, from June 2008 to June 2009, industrial production in India grew by 7.1%.|$|E
25|$|While {{direct support}} {{has not been}} found for these hypotheses, {{evidence}} that favours this theory exists. Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15–48% per older brother, these odds really <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> a few percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied {{to the majority of}} homosexual men. Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal birth order effect. Some did not find any statistically significant difference in either the sibling composition or rate of older brothers of gay and straight men, including large, nationally representative studies in the US and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|State {{schools are}} {{generally}} seen as equivalent in {{quality of education}} to private-sector institutions. However, {{the value of a}} state high-school diploma is limited {{by the fact that the}} grades obtained <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.|$|E
