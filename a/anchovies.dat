Unable to satisfy the anchovies' hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the <b>anchovies</b> and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay.

40|$|Abstract — In {{central and}} {{southern}} coastal areas of Vietnam, annual yield of <b>anchovy</b> is enormous that leads the high demand for <b>anchovy</b> drying. Moreover, seafood in generally and <b>anchovy</b> in particularly brings more benefit for fishermen, especially dried <b>anchovy</b> as an exporting product {{is one of the}} main their income. The market requires that <b>anchovy</b> product has to be dried before packaging to export. There are many drying methods to process the <b>anchovy</b> but some problems might need to be solved such as the drying efficiency, the low product quality and sanitation, and the environmental annihilation. In order to using the profuse solar energy, a model for experiment investigation the <b>anchovy</b> dryer has been conducted in ThuDuc district, Hochiminh city with the <b>anchovy</b> caught from Kien giang and Baria-Vung tau province, southern Vietnam. The results indicate that solar energy is one of renewable energy which can be completely used for <b>anchovy</b> drying with high drying efficiency.

40|$|The {{role that}} {{juvenile}} <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis encrasicolus) {{play as a}} food resource for the demersal community in the southern Bay of Biscay is assessed using 21 years of <b>anchovy</b> abundance data and demersal predator diets. During the study period, a total of 26 fish and elasmobranch species preyed on <b>anchovy</b> either frequently or occasionally. Predators with a crustacean-based diet targeted the smaller <b>anchovy</b> individuals. The size range of <b>anchovy</b> juveniles (centred at 7. 5 – 8. 9 cm) was {{comparable to that of}} the largest nektonic–benthic crustaceans, but generally smaller than other demersal and pelagic fish prey. Hake (Merluccius merluccius) and megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) were the predators that consumed the highest number of <b>anchovy,</b> one of the main prey items driving the variability of their diets. <b>Anchovy</b> consumption conformed only partially to the abundance of <b>anchovy</b> in the southern Bay of Biscay, suggesting that factors other than abundance might condition its availability to demersal predators. Prey size could be one of them, as the size of the <b>anchovy</b> preyed on proved to be significantly smaller than the individuals collected with bottom trawls. However, other factors, such as the vertical position of the shoals of <b>anchovy</b> juveniles, could also constrain <b>anchovy</b> availability to demersal predators...|$|R

5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and <b>anchovies</b> are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes <b>anchovies,</b> and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, <b>anchovies,</b> rays are harvested and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including <b>anchovies,</b> herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and <b>anchovies,</b> tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of <b>anchovies</b> by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any <b>anchovies</b> that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{availability}} of Age Length Keys for <b>anchovy</b> catch data, assumptions about the age composition of the <b>anchovy</b> catches are needed. Previous assessments and management procedures have been based upon the assumption that all <b>anchovy</b> caught from April to October were recruits (0 -year-olds), while all <b>anchovy</b> caught from November to March were 1 -year-olds, with 2 -year-old and older fish not appearing in the catches at all. These assumptions were based upon the life-history characteristics of <b>anchovy</b> and general fishing patterns (De Oliveira 2003). This document considers whether a (monthly varying) cut-off length could instead be used to split the <b>anchovy</b> catch into juveniles and adults (1 year-olds only) for each month of the year...|$|R
40|$|The European <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis encrasicolus {{population}} of the North Sea has increased and spread in recent decades, probably {{in response to the}} relaxation of limiting factors in its life history. We use models and empirical data to explore the effects of temperature and food availability during the first growing season on the adult <b>anchovy</b> population across the North Sea. First, we compare simulated growth during summer and autumn, from a dynamic energy budget model, with trends in the time series of <b>anchovy</b> survey catch per unit effort. The proportion of the area of the North Sea in which <b>anchovy</b> can grow to 10 cm (the potential growth habitat) correlates with the abundance of <b>anchovy</b> caught in surveys the following year. Second, spatio-temporal statistical modeling is used to show that <b>anchovy</b> abundance in surveys is related to environmental variables (temperature and food availability). Temperature explains the distribution and abundance of <b>anchovy</b> in the North Sea better than food availability or a combination of both environmental factors. We conclude that variations in growth during the first months of life can impact <b>anchovy</b> life cycle closure. Specifically for the North Sea <b>anchovy,</b> changes in temperature are more important than changes in food availability in allowing the fish to grow to overwintering size, under probably non-food-limited conditions...|$|R

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and <b>anchovies,</b> with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder.

Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of <b>anchovies,</b> sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including <b>anchovies,</b> jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E

Seasonal variations of circulation, water temperature and mix-layer depth from POM are used as external forcing for NEMURO and the <b>anchovy</b> model. Biomasses of large zooplankton and predatory zooplankton which <b>anchovy</b> feeds on are output from NEMURO and are controlled by the consumption of <b>anchovy</b> on them.

40|$|European <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis encrasicolus {{increased}} its abundance and {{distribution in the}} North Sea during the mid- 1990 s and may consume similar zooplankton to and/or compete with other occupants of the North Sea like herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus. The diets of adult <b>anchovy,</b> sprat and juvenile herring of comparable sizes, sampled close in time and space, were compared {{to understand how the}} 3 species prey on zooplankton and establish whether their diets overlap or not. <b>Anchovy</b> was found to be more generalist, consuming a higher diversity of prey items. Herring was more specialized, with low diversity of food items. Sprat was intermediate between <b>anchovy</b> and herring. The dietary overlap between <b>anchovy</b> and sprat was highest, followed by herring and sprat before <b>anchovy</b> and herring. The mean weight of stomach contents did not differ between species.

5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} thresher, the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as herrings and <b>anchovies.</b> It is a fast, strong swimmer that {{has been known to}} leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, <b>anchovies,</b> ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, <b>anchovies,</b> sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In late 1999 Artisanal Fisherman Association in Thailand {{requested}} {{the government to}} take actions in curbing destructive <b>anchovy</b> fishing gears.

Economic losses of juvenile bycatch were $ 1 – 331 /boat/trip. In Songkhla, the crisis problem area, economic losses from light luring falling net were as high as 0. 42 – 7. 64 times of the return from <b>anchovy.</b> The losses from light luring <b>anchovy</b> purse seine were 23 – 35 % of the return from <b>anchovy.</b> The losses from light luring scoop net varied around 2 – 7 %. <b>Anchovy</b> catch values in Thailand was $ 26 million in 1997. Value added from processing was $ 65 million, mainly from fish sauce. In spite of low value added, 59 % of the catches were processed as boiled-dried/dried <b>anchovy</b> mainly for export. 44 % of the <b>anchovy</b> value in the importing country were the trade margins, including tax, in importing country.
