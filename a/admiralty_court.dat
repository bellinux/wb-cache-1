5|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the collision were sworn to secrecy due to national security concerns. The loss was not publicly reported until after the war ended, although the Admiralty filed a writ against Queen Marys owners, Cunard White Star Line, on 22 September 1943 in the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Court</b> of the High Court of Justice. Little happened until 1945, when the case went to trial in June; it was adjourned to November and then to December 1946. Mr. Justice Pilcher exonerated the Queen Marys crew and her owners from blame on 21 January 1947 and laid all fault on Curacoas officers. The Admiralty appealed his ruling and the Court of Appeal modified the ruling, assigning two-thirds of the blame to the Admiralty and one third to Cunard White Star. The latter appealed to the House of Lords, but they upheld the decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an <b>admiralty</b> <b>court,</b> held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority {{all the way up}} to the top of the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were clogged with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E
5|$|Mersea Fort {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Captain William Burrell. Guns and {{ammunition}} were kept there in case of a fresh rebellion, with a garrison of 36 men, which was temporarily reinforced by an additional squadron of horsemen and 50 foot soldiers in July 1650. Repairs were made from 1651 onwards, and new accommodation was constructed for the fort's gunners. After an invasion scare in 1655, Mersea was temporarily used to imprison Royalists suspected of planning an insurgency against Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government. The fort was then demobilised by Cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs; Burrell was ordered to dismantle the fort but the order was never carried out, partially because of the practical difficulties and because of opposition from the owner of the land. The <b>admiralty</b> <b>court</b> continued to be held in the fort, although it proved much harder to enforce the fishery rules because of the political turmoil.|$|E

5|$|Mersea Fort, {{also known}} as Cudmore Grove Blockhouse, was an {{artillery}} fort established by Henry VIII on the East Mersea coast in 1543. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the River Colne {{that led to the}} town of Colchester. It was triangular in shape, with earthwork walls and three bastions to hold artillery. It was demobilised in 1552, but was brought back into use several times over the next century and saw service during the Second English Civil War of 1648. The fort hosted an <b>admiralty</b> <b>court</b> to oversea the local oyster trade, until the dilapidation of the site forced the court to move to the Moot Hall in Colchester {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. A new gun battery was built at the fort during the Napoleonic Wars, but the fortification then fell into decline and was extensively damaged by the construction of a sea wall along the coast. The remains of the earthworks were excavated by archaeologists between 2002 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|Scottish privateers and pirates preyed on {{shipping}} in the North Sea {{and off the}} Atlantic {{coast of}} France. Scotland's <b>Admiralty</b> <b>court</b> judged whether a captured ship was a lawful prize and dealt with the recovery of goods. As the court was entitled to {{a tenth of the}} value of a prize, it was a profitable business for the admiral. The privateers Andrew and Robert Barton were still using their letters of reprisal of 1506 against the Portuguese in 1561. The Bartons operated down the east coast of Britain from Leven and the Firth of Forth, while others used the French Channel ports such as Rouen and Dieppe or the Atlantic port of Brest as bases. During the Rough Wooing in 1542, the Mary Willoughby, the Lion, and the Salamander under the command of John Barton, son of Robert Barton, attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby. They later blockaded a London merchant ship called the Antony of Bruges in a creek on the coast of Brittany. In 1544 Edinburgh was attacked by an English marine force and burnt. The Salamander and the Scottish-built Unicorn were captured at Leith. The Scots still had two royal naval vessels and numerous smaller private vessels, but would have to rely on privateers until the re-establishment of a royal fleet in the 1620s. When, {{as a result of the}} series of international treaties, the emperor Charles V declared war upon Scotland in 1544, the Scots were able to engage in a highly profitable campaign of privateering that lasted six years and the gains of which probably outweighed the losses in trade with the Low Countries. They also operated in the West Indies from the 1540s, joining the French in the capture of Burburuta in 1567. English and Scottish naval warfare and privateering broke out sporadically in the 1550s. In 1559, English captain William Winter was sent north with 34 ships and dispersed and captured the Scottish and French fleets, leading to the eventual evacuation of the French from Scotland, and a successful coup of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Scottish and English interests were re-aligned and the naval conflict subsided.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> were a {{prominent}} {{feature in the}} prelude to the American Revolution. For example, the phrase in the Declaration of Independence [...] "For depriving us in many cases, {{of the benefits of}} Trial by Jury" [...] refers to the practice of Parliament giving the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Courts</b> jurisdiction to enforce The Stamp Act in the American Colonies. Because the Stamp Act was unpopular, a colonial jury was unlikely to convict a colonist of its violation. However, because <b>admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> did not (as is true today) grant trial by jury, a colonist accused of violating the Stamp Act could be more easily convicted by the Crown.|$|R
50|$|The Stamp Act allowed <b>admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> to have {{jurisdiction}} for trying violators, following the example established by the Sugar Act. However, <b>admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> had traditionally been limited to cases involving the high seas. The Sugar Act seemed to fall within this precedent, but the Stamp Act did not, and the colonists saw this as a further attempt to replace their local courts with courts controlled by England.|$|R

25|$|Another {{measure to}} enforce the trade laws was the Vice <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Court</b> Act of 1768. Although often {{included}} in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the Cabinet when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death. Before this act, {{there was just one}} vice <b>admiralty</b> <b>court</b> in North America, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Court</b> Act created four district courts, which were located at Halifax, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have juries, was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.|$|E
25|$|During {{her time}} off Sierra Leone Dart {{detained}} five slave trading vessels, {{all of which}} she sent into Freetown where the Vice <b>admiralty</b> <b>court</b> condemned them.|$|E

5000|$|The Act also {{provided}} seamen with additional protections. Prior to the Act, Vice <b>Admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> {{had been very}} reluctant to liberate sailors from ships. Once the Act was passed, courts were increasingly willing to allow liberation if contracts were broken. [...] One provision of the Act ensured that mariners who joined a Royal Navy ship were entitled to the full pay they had earned from the ship they left behind. Mariners were generally successful in using the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Courts</b> to escape prior contracts and collect the fees they had earned.|$|R

25|$|Prior to the Taney Court, no {{reported}} decision recorded {{an attempt}} by a party to obtain review {{in a criminal case}} by means of a prerogative writ other than habeas corpus.

25|$|The University of Bologna {{served as}} the model for other law schools of the medieval age. While it was common for {{students}} of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of Roman law (except for certain jurisdictions such as the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Court)</b> and although the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge did teach canon law until the English Reformation, its importance was always superior to civil law in those institutions.|$|E
