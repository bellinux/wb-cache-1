25|$|Lista Lufthavn {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with CHC Helikopter Service to use Lista as a reserve airport should Sola become unavailable. There was limited use of the airport and CHC terminated the agreement in March 2007. However, this status allowed the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>flight</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> (AFIS) service to be retained. This was closed on 1 September 2007.|$|E
25|$|After the privatization, Air Stord {{operated}} {{services from}} 1996 to 1999. An <b>aerodrome</b> <b>flight</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> was retained until 2007, although the airport saw very limited use. The main client was CHC Helikopter Service, who {{used it as}} a reserve base for flights to the North Sea. The main challenge for Farsund Airport has been the proximity to Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and the limited catchment area which only covers Lister.|$|E

25|$|Lufttransport won {{the tender}} valid from 1 August 2005, winning ahead of CHC with a bid of NOK56 million. Lufttransport renewed the {{contract}} {{for a new}} three years starting 1 August 2008, after {{they were the only}} bidder in the tender. They received NOK102 million for three years. During this period better navigational aids were installed, allowing helicopters to operate during twice per day also during the dark period of the year. Lufttransport was the only bidder for the following contract, which lasts three years from 1 August 2011. The subsidies for this period are NOK96 million. Because it only serves helicopters, Værøy does not have an <b>aerodrome</b> <b>flight</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> (AFIS). As part of the Single European Sky ATM Research program, Avinor installed a remote AFIS service at Værøy, which is controlled from Bodø. If successful, the program may result in regional airports in Norway receiving remote AFIS services.|$|E
