40|$|Radipherpus protheses are a {{means of}} {{treatment}} for malignant tumor-carrying patients. These protheses are used in cases of brachytherapy or external <b>actinotherapy</b> by contact and allow treating them with high radiation doses that are quickly released from the areas next to tumor, so that the radiations be restricted to the affected region, without the emissions damaging or destroying the soft tissues. Based on these considerations, the present paper was aimed at making literature review {{on the use of}} radipherous protheses for the treatment of head and neck neoplasias. © 2006 1995, Editorial Ciencias médicas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{emergence}} of the therapeutic use of sunlight in medicine {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. This was a period of considerable flux in medicine with various strands of practice and theory competing. Drawing on two case studies of sunlight therapy, both artificial (<b>actinotherapy)</b> and natural (heliotherapy), in the treatment of rickets and tuberculosis this paper will explore how medicine was constituted within these regimes. The paper will argue that therapeutic and clinical applications of sunlight helped establish an association between sunlight and health but also defined a particular and specific performance of medicine...|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} of <b>actinotherapy</b> in Mental Hospitals {{in this country}} is reviewed. An investigation of the results of ultra-violet irradiation in mental disorders at Parkside Mental Hospital is described and it is shown that certain types of the psychoses appear to benefit. The physiological action of actinic rays in relation to mental disorders is discussed and their mode of action on the nervous system suggested. Reference is made to substances which sensitize the body tissues to sunlight and ultra-violet radiation. An allusion is made to glass, penetrable by a portion of the actinic rays, and its uses. The need for ultra-violet ray apparatus in every mental hospital is urged both for treatment of mental and physical conditions and for the study of its action...|$|E
40|$|Physiotherapy is {{concerned}} with identifying and maximizing movement potential, within the spheres of promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Physical therapists practice in {{a broad range of}} inpatient, outpatient, and community-based settings such as hospice and palliative care centers where as part of a multidisciplinary team of care, they address the physical and functional dimensions of the patients&#x 2032; suffering. Physiotherapy treatment methods like therapeutic exercise, electrical modalities, thermal modalities, <b>actinotherapy,</b> mechanical modalities, manual physical therapy and assistive devices are useful for a range of life-threatening and life-limiting conditions like cancer and cancer-associated conditions; HIV; neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis; respiratory disorders like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; and altered mental states. The professional armamentarium is still expanding with inclusion of other miscellaneous techniques which were also proven to be effective in improving quality of life in these patients. Considering the scope of physiotherapy in India, and in palliative care, professionals in a multidisciplinary palliative care team need to understand and mutually involve toward policy changes to successfully implement physical therapeutic palliative care delivery...|$|E
