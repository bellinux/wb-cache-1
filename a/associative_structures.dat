40|$|Does child-directed {{language}} {{differ from}} adult-directed language {{in ways that}} might facilitate word learning? <b>Associative</b> <b>structure</b> (the probability that a word appears with its free associates), contextual diversity, word repetitions and frequency were compared longitudinally across six language corpora, with four corpora of language directed at children aged 1; 0 to 5; 0, and two adult-directed corpora representing spoken and written language.

Moreover, these statistical properties of child-directed language better predicted word acquisition than the same statistics in adult-directed language. Word frequency and repetitions were the best predictors within word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives and function words).

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effects of environmental context on false recognition using two lists of <b>associative</b> <b>structures.</b> Sixteen to-be-remembered lists were auditorily presented to the participants. Of the sixteen、 eight lists were associated lists consisting items which {{were associated with the}} lure item (not presented in the study session). The remaining eight were category lists consisting category examples. A lure item in this list was one of the category examples. In the study session、 participants were asked to judge how much the items were imaginable. The next day、 in the same room as in the study session or in a different room、 participants engaged in a visual recognition test including studied items and lure items. In the associated list condition、 reinstatement of environmental context increased both the correct and the false recognitions. In the category list condition、 only false recognitions were increased. Associated lists elicited false recognitions much more than the category lists. These results indicated that the reinstatement of environmental context facilitates false recognition.

40|$|This paper reviews {{some of the}} {{literature}} on Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning as they relate to“cognitive” factors in behavior. Studies of Pavlovian learning have centered around the notion that a representation of the unconditioned stimulus plays a critical role in performance. However, much work will need to go into characterizing the nature of the representations that mediate learning. In particular, current research illustrates that “images” and “expectancies” of reward may differ in fundamental ways, and also that learning about temporal, motivational, and sensory properties of reward might involve different systems. The study of instrumental learning also poses challenges for addressing the question of what representations, i. e., <b>associative</b> <b>structures,</b> underlie such learning. Current work reveals a host of <b>associative</b> <b>structures</b> that may participate in learning and performance though how these different structures participate in a unified approach is currently unknown. The associative approach can be contrasted with inferential reasoning approaches to instrumental action, and there are two key findings that seem outside the scope of a reasoning approach. Nevertheless, future work will be required to determine just how far purely associative models will be able to go in order to account for complex behavior...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{existence}} of a braiding in a monoidal category V allows many structures to be built upon that foundation. These include a monoidal 2 -category V-Cat of enriched categories and functors over V, a monoidal bicategory V-Mod of enriched categories and modules, a category of operads in V and a 2 -fold monoidal category structure on V. We will begin by focusing our exposition on the first and last in this list due to their ability to shed light on a new question. We ask, given a braiding on V, what non-equal structures of a given kind in the list exist which are based upon the braiding. For instance, what non-equal monoidal structures are available on V-Cat, or what non-equal operad structures are available which base their associative structure on the braiding in V. We demonstrate alternative underlying braids that result in an infinite family of <b>associative</b> <b>structures.</b> The external and internal associativity diagrams in the axioms of a 2 -fold monoidal category will provide us with several obstructions that can prevent a braid from underlying an associative structure.

We reuse the large register file in the multi-threaded cores to implement some out-of-order structures and reengineer other large, <b>associative</b> <b>structures</b> into simpler lookup tables.

40|$|Knowledge {{is often}} {{thought to be}} {{something}} brought from outside to act upon the visual messages received from the eye in a 'top-down' fashion, {{but this is a}} misleadingly narrow view. First, the visual system is a multilevel heterarchy with connections acting in all directions so it has no 'top'; and second, knowledge is provided through innately determined structure and by analysis of the redundancy in sensory messages themselves, as well as from outside. This paper gives evidence about mechanisms analysing sensory redundancy in biological vision. Automatic gain controls for luminance and contrast depend upon feedback from the input, and there are strong indications that the autocorrelation function, and other associations between input variables, affect the contrast sensitivity function and our subjective experience of the world. The <b>associative</b> <b>structure</b> of sensory message can provide much knowledge about the world we live in, and neural mechanisms that discount established <b>associative</b> <b>structure</b> in the input messages by recoding them can improve survival by making new structure more easily detectable. These mechanisms may be responsible for illusions, such as those produced by a concave face-mask, that are classically attributed to top-down influences...|$|R
40|$|The {{cognitive}} associative {{structure of}} 2 populations was studied using network analysis of free-word associations.

Size and centralization of semantic structures were larger for college students than for 7 th graders, while density, clustering, and mean path length were similar. Findings presented reveal that subpopulations might have very different cognitive associative networks.
