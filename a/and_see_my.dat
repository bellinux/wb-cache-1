Donne first {{concludes that}} he may not be aware that the bell is tolling, saying [...] "hee for whom this Bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knowes not it tolls for him; And perchance I may thinke my selfe so much better than I am, as that they who are about mee, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> state, may have caused it to toll for mee, and I know not that". This is then expanded with the realisation that, even if the bell is tolling for others, {{it is a matter of}} concern for Donne, as: ...|$|E
500|$|Pinker {{identifies}} {{himself as}} an equity feminist, which he defines as [...] "a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology". He reported {{the result of a}} test of his political orientation that characterized him as [...] "neither leftist nor rightist, more libertarian than authoritarian." [...] He describes himself as having [...] "experienced a primitive tribal stirring" [...] after his genes were shown to trace back to the Middle East, noting that he [...] "found it just as thrilling to zoom outward in the diagrams of my genetic lineage <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> place in a family tree that embraces all of humanity".|$|E
500|$|Stengel tried incessantly {{to promote}} the Mets, talking to reporters or anyone else who would listen. He often used the word [...] "amazin'" [...] (as he put it) and soon this became the [...] "Amazin' Mets", a {{nickname}} that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, [...] "Come out <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> amazin' Mets. I been in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose I never knew existed before." [...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Alice and Jerry" [...] books {{followed}} a sister and brother, Alice and Jerry, {{as well as}} their dog Jip, through a series of simple events in relatively plain settings. [...] The [...] "Alice and Jerry" [...] series followed patterns similar to the Dick and Jane readers, which are now better known in the United States. The sentences in the [...] "Alice and Jerry" [...] readers were short, and used repeating words to build reader's stamina and familiarity. For instance, here is the text from the book [...] "Skip Along": [...] "One, two three. Come <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> Come <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> <b>See</b> <b>my</b> umbrella. Look, Jerry. Up. // One, two three. Come <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> Come <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> <b>See</b> <b>my</b> airplane. Up, up, up. Down." ...|$|R

He says that he found his love of music during those trips through a Mexican ballad that was [...] "probably a Ranchera, you know, on the car radio with my dad". He began playing in an R band called The Systems by 1965 while {{attending}} Hilltop High School in Chula Vista, California. His first job was at Napoleone Pizza House in National City, about which he sings in [...] "I Can't Wait to Get Off Work (<b>And</b> <b>See</b> <b>My</b> Baby on Montgomery Avenue)" [...] on Small Change, and also in [...] "The Ghosts of Saturday Night (After Hours at Napoleone's Pizza House)" [...] on The Heart of Saturday Night). He later admitted that he was not a fan of 1960s music: [...] "I wasn't thrilled by Blue Cheer, so I found an alternative, even if it was Bing Crosby." [...] Five years later, he was working as a doorman at the Heritage nightclub in San Diego where artists of every genre performed, and he performed his first paid gig for $6. He was a fan of Bob Dylan, Lord Buckley, Jack Kerouac, Louis Armstrong, Howlin' Wolf, and Charles Bukowski, but he began developing his own idiosyncratic musical style.|$|E
