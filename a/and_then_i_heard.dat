500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track. She {{described it as}} a simple song, and further explained, [...] "I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November 1968, {{two days}} before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an {{exclusive}} interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs. Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's , [...] "Who You Are", was {{released}} to the US iTunes Store on 22 February 2011. [...] It is the song from the album of which she is proudest. It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. [...] "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I {{want to be a}} positive role model for young people. I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist," [...] she laughs. She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. So I looked in the mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?' Music is my therapy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it was a}} kind of screech, sir, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> {{somebody}} drivin' very 'ard {{down the}} road. I remember thinking that it was strange that any one should be driving away from Crawley on a great night like this." ...|$|R
60|$|I said nothing; {{the face}} vanished, <b>and</b> just <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> a baboon bark {{in the rocks}} behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the cabin at last, and arter {{lighting}} the lamp I ’ad another sup o’ the skipper’s whisky to clear my ’ead, and sat down to try and think wot tale I was to tell ’im. I sat for pretty near three hours without thinking of one, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>’eard</b> the crew come on to the wharf.|$|R
2500|$|Kenny G has {{attracted}} significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Pat Metheny {{stated that he}} was a [...] "pop" [...] saxophonist, [...] "but was not really an advanced player, even in that style", adding that he had [...] "major rhythmic problems" [...] and that his [...] "harmonic and melodic vocabulary was extremely limited, mostly to pentatonic based and blues-lick derived patterns". Metheny believes that the main reason why Kenny G has become unpopular and easy to attack by accomplished jazz musicians is due to the [...] "fact that he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years". [...] Branford Marsalis once stated in an interview with Jazziz magazine: [...] "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz. The audience he has wouldn't be caught dead at a real jazz concert or club. It's not like some guy says, ‘You know, I used to listen to Miles, 'Trane and Ornette. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Kenny G, and I never put on another Miles record.' It's a completely different audience." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the boy's voice once more.|$|E
60|$|I am of the faery people. I sent my {{messengers}} {{for milk}} and fire, <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> one call {{to me and}} came.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{moved off}} without another word—from them, <b>I</b> mean. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the wicket slam <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>’eard</b> a cab drive off over the stones. I couldn’t believe it at first. I couldn’t believe a gal with such {{beautiful}} blue eyes {{could be so}} hard-’earted, {{and for a long}} time I stood listening and hoping to ’ear the cab come back. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> stepped up to the companion and tried to shift it with my shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|I had a dream. Yes, {{some one}} softly said, [...] "He's gone," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a sigh went round the room; [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> surely <b>heard</b> a priestly voice [...] Cry Subvenite; and they knelt in prayer.|$|R
60|$|He stalked {{off with}} his 'ead in the air, and left me all alone {{in charge of a}} wharf with a ghost on it. I stayed outside in the street, of course, but every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{something}} moving about {{the other side of the}} gate, and once it was so distinct that I run along to the Bear's Head and knocked 'em up and asked them for a little brandy, for illness.|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes {{may have}} passed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{the clatter of}} many steps, and a knot of men came {{clustering}} through the door.|$|E
6000|$|Thus I {{closed my}} musings. [...] "Good-night" [...] left my lips in sound; I {{heard the words}} spoken, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> an echo--quite close.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Mr. Pike snarling out orders, and in {{my heart}} {{discovered}} a growing respect for Cape Horn--Cape Stiff, as the sailors call it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Practical is the word," [...] said he, {{with another}} hateful chuckle. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> amidst {{the roar of}} the storm, the creak and whine of the winch-handle turning and the rattle of the grating as it passed through the slot. Great God, he was letting loose the Brazilian cat! ...|$|R
6000|$|Know. My lord, I and he {{were once}} in Villain's Lane together, and he {{at that time}} did briskly talk of divers opinions; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him say, that, for his part, he did {{believe that there was}} no God. 'But,' said he, 'I can profess one, and be as {{religious}} too, if the company I am in, and the circumstances of other things,' said he, 'shall put me upon it.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped back}} and leaned against my bed with a level, quiet glance. I sat on the couch. We {{had nothing to say}} to each other. Over our heads the officer of the watch moved here <b>and</b> there. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him move quickly. I knew what that meant. He was making for the companion; and {{presently}} his voice was outside my door.|$|R
6000|$|Without really seeing it, I was {{conscious}} {{that all this}} was taking place around us, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Sergeant Corney say to the general, in a matter-of-fact tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|The silence {{lasted for}} some time <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> a murmur: “It’s {{a matter of the}} utmost {{delicacy}} between two beings so sensitive, so proud. It has to be managed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was in {{the next}} room, {{drinking}} of my beer. I couldn't help that, could I? <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> her name; and I couldn't help listening then. Flesh and blood couldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't know, in a way, and yet I did. There was {{somebody}} about who {{made me think}} of England, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> you see, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> you sing." ...|$|R
60|$|Fred's {{door was}} shut, and I {{could hear him}} snoring. <b>I</b> {{scratched}} gently, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> harder, till <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the snores stop. He {{got out of bed}} and opened the door.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not notice it!’ {{continued}} Wisbottle. ‘Bless you; I saw him {{whispering to}} her, and she crying; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I’ll swear <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him {{say something about}} to-night when {{we were all in}} bed.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed as}} if I lived a full hour during the terrible ten seconds that elapsed after the first volley was fired by the hidden foe, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Sergeant Corney crying in my ear, his voice {{sounding}} as if afar off: ...|$|E
6000|$|Only {{confused}} murmurs escaped her at first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> her whisper my father's name. Very low--hardly {{more than}} breathed--were the words, but upon the silence each syllable struck clear and distinct: [...] "Ah no, we must not. Luke, my darling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is YOU!" [...] she gasped. [...] "I {{prayed for}} some one to come, but I did not dream {{it would be}} YOU. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> YOUR voice--and I thought it could be only a dream until you called a second time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the morrow at dawn I {{rose and}} shook the dew from the wolf-hide. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> went on into the forest and howled like a wolf. They knew my voice, the ghost-wolves, and howled in answer from far <b>and</b> near. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the pattering of their feet, and they came round me by tens and by twenties, and fawned upon me. I counted their number; they {{numbered}} three hundred and sixty and three.|$|R
6000|$|They told me <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of {{the haunted}} Red Room {{as one who}} bears a tale. [...] "We found you at dawn," [...] said he, [...] "and there was blood on your {{forehead}} and lips." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he took me}} out at the door, {{my mother}} ran towards us. Miss Murdstone said, 'Clara! are you a perfect fool?' and interfered. I saw my mother stop her ears <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> her crying.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> M. de Bassompierre showing to her how he {{was well}} {{provided}} against the weather; and {{how he was}} going to have the carriage, and to be quite snugly sheltered; and, in short, proving that she need not fear for his comfort.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> her utter a {{helpless}} sort of moan; a sound which, struggling {{out of the}} heart of a person of her pride and strength, affected me more than if she had made the wood dolorously vocal with a thousand shrieks and wails.|$|E
6000|$|I was falling, but I {{never reached}} the grass. Came a blurr of {{flashing}} lights, a thunder in my ears, a darkness, a glimmering of dim light slowly dawning, a wrenching, racking pain beyond all describing, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{the voice of}} one who said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> it was <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> not {{loud and}} {{penetrating}} as at first, but faint and dim like a dying voice, that tolling, that same tolling that had welcomed {{the coming of}} the day: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...|$|R
60|$|ROSAMUND. Nothing. He sued my hand. I shook at him. He {{found me}} once alone. Nay--nay--I cannot Tell you: my father drove {{him and his}} friends, De Tracy and De Brito, from our castle. I was but {{fourteen}} <b>and</b> an April <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him swear revenge.|$|R
2500|$|... "A former prostitute {{recalled}} {{that as soon}} as Australian troops arrived in Kure in early 1946, they 'dragged young women into their jeeps, took them to the mountain, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> raped them. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> them screaming for help nearly every night'." ...|$|R
