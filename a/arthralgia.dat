40|$|Musculoskeletal health can be {{compromised}} by breast cancer treatment. In particular, bone loss and <b>arthralgias</b> are prevalent side effects experienced by women treated with chemotherapy and/or adjuvant endocrine therapy. Bone loss leads to osteoporosis and related fractures, while <b>arthralgias</b> threaten {{quality of life}} and compliance to treatment. Because the processes that lead to these musculoskeletal problems are initiated when treatment begins, early identification of women who may be at higher risk of developing problems, routine monitoring of bone density and pain at certain stages of treatment, and prudent application of therapeutic interventions are key to preventing and/or minimizing musculoskeletal sequelae. Exercise may be a particularly suitable intervention strategy because of its potential to address a number of impairments; it may slow bone loss, appears to reduce joint pain in noncancer conditions, and improves other breast cancer outcomes. Research efforts continue in the areas of etiology, measurement, and treatment of bone loss and <b>arthralgias.</b> The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the management and treatment of bone loss and <b>arthralgias</b> in breast cancer survivors and to present a framework for rehabilitation care to preserve musculoskeletal health in women treated for breast cancer...|$|R

The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, photosensitivity, abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia, <b>arthralgia,</b> myalgia, rash, itch, and priapism.|$|E
40|$|Chikungunya fever (CHIK) is {{a disease}} caused by a virus {{transmitted}} to humans by infected mosquitos. The virus is responsible for multiple outbreaks in tropical and temperate areas worldwide, {{and is now a}} global concern. Clinical and biological features of the disease are poorly described, especially in Africa, where the disease is neglected because it is considered benign. During a recent CHIK outbreak that occurred in southeast Gabon, we prospectively studied clinical and biological features of 270 virologically confirmed cases. Fever and <b>arthralgias</b> were the predominant symptoms. Furthermore, variable and distinct clinical pictures including pure febrile, pure arthralgic and unusual forms (neither fever nor <b>arthralgias)</b> were detected. No severe forms or deaths were reported. These findings suggest that, during CHIK epidemics, some patients may not have classical symptoms (fever and <b>arthralgias).</b> Local surveillance is needed to detect any changes in the pathogenicity of this virus...|$|R

25|$|Xerostomia may {{be caused}} by {{autoimmune}} damage to the salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is one such disease, and it causes other symptoms, including xerophthalmia (dry eyes), dry vagina, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), and <b>arthralgia</b> (joint pain). Females are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disease, and 90% of people with Sjögren's syndrome are women. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is the combination of dry eyes and xerostomia. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome is identical to primary form but {{with the addition of a}} combination of other connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

25|$|Anticonvulsants {{affect the}} bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low Vitamin D levels, and {{increased}} parathyroid hormone. Anticonvulsants {{also contribute to the}} increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants. In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause <b>arthralgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|RNA {{interference}} of BRAF {{stops the}} multiplication of melanoma tumor cells. This suggests that BRAF inhibitors such as sorafenib, PLX4720, PLX4032, GDC-0879, GSK2118436, or AZ628 may be affective in treating melanoma. These {{have been tested}} and proven {{to slow down the}} production of melanoma due to BRAF mutation but PLX4032 and GSK2118436 show the most promise because they worked the most aggressively in early stages of cell development. Although this drug helps slow down or shrink the tumors, there are many serious side affects to using these drugs that were found in the trials including <b>arthralgia,</b> rash, nausea, phosphosensitivity], fatigue, pruritus and palmo-plantar dysesthesia.|$|E

50|$|Infections by Mansonella perstans, while often asymptomatic, can be {{associated}} with angioedema, pruritus, fever, headaches, <b>arthralgias,</b> and neurologic manifestations. Mansonella streptocerca can manifest on the skin via pruritus, papular eruptions and pigmentation changes. Mansonella ozzardi can cause symptoms that include <b>arthralgias,</b> headaches, fever, pulmonary symptoms, adenopathy, hepatomegaly, and pruritus. Eosinophilia is often prominent in all cases of Mansonelliasis. M. perstans can also present with Calabar-like swellings, hives, and a condition known as Kampala, or Ugandan eye worm. This occurs when adult M. perstans invades the conjunctiva or periorbital connective tissues in the eye. M. perstans can also present with hydrocele in South America. However, it is often hard to distinguish between the symptoms of Mansonelliasis and other nematode infections endemic to the same areas.|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} therapeutic {{procedures and}} when they are clinically indicated in the management of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC) {{have been the subject of}} much debate. This paper reviews current knowledge and our experience in the treatment of this complex disease. It is generally agreed that patients with purpura, the primary symptom of EMC, should avoid long periods of sitting or standing in the same position. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be used for the management of <b>arthralgias</b> and/ or arthritis. Low dose steroids (0. 5 - 0. 3 mg/kg/die) are usually sufficient to control the purpura, <b>arthralgias,</b> arthritis and weakness, while larger doses (0. 5 - 1. 5 mg/kg/die) are needed to treat the renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy and serositis. Since the discovery of the association between EMC and viral infections, the appropriateness of cytotoxic drugs has been re-evaluated and they are no longer used. With the low antigen content diet, a regimen designed to restore a saturated mononuclear phagocytic system, good results have been obtained in the treatment of purpura, <b>arthralgias,</b> weakness and peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, this dietary regimen may play a steroid sparing role. Plasma exchange is widely used in the management of severe renal involvement, hyperviscosity syndrome, sensory motor neuropathy and liver involvement in EM...|$|R
