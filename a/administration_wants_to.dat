5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Congressman Donald Blythe (Reed Birney), a {{committed}} progressive liberal {{who has long}} pushed for education reform, with whom the Walker <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> work on a bill. Frank dismisses his proposal as too ambitious and asks him to rewrite it. Frank secretly passes a copy of Blythe’s proposal to Zoe. He then meets with Senator Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) and suggests that she ought to consider seeking the nomination for Secretary of State. He also privately confronts Congressman Russo about his arrest and checkered history of substance abuse and soliciting prostitutes, and demands Russo’s loyalty in exchange for making the incident disappear.|$|E
2500|$|On January 31, 2006, Kaine {{gave the}} Democratic {{response}} to President George W. Bush's 2006 State of the Union address. In it, Kaine criticized the Bush administration's No Child Left Behind Act for [...] "wreaking havoc on local school districts"; criticized congressional Republicans for cutting student loan programs; and condemned as [...] "reckless" [...] Bush's spending increases and tax cuts. Kaine praised bipartisan initiatives in Virginia [...] "to make record investments in education" [...] {{and to improve}} veterans' access to veterans' benefits. Kaine criticized the Bush administration's conduct of the Iraq War and treatment of U.S. soldiers; saying that [...] "the American people were given inaccurate information about reasons for invading Iraq"; [...] "our troops in Iraq were not given the best body armor or the best intelligence"; and [...] "the <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> further reduce military and veterans' benefits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy {{has been}} active off the bench as well, calling for reform of overcrowded American prisons in a speech before the American Bar Association. He spends his summers in Salzburg, Austria, where he teaches {{international}} and American law at the University of Salzburg for the McGeorge School of Law international program and often attends the large yearly international judges conference held there. Defending his use of international law, in 2005 Kennedy told The New Yorker staff writer Jeffrey Toobin, [...] "Why should world opinion care that the American <b>Administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> bring freedom to oppressed peoples? Is that not because there's some underlying common mutual interest, some underlying common shared idea, some underlying common shared aspiration, underlying unified concept of what human dignity means? I think that's what we're trying to tell {{the rest of the}} world, anyway." ...|$|E
50|$|The end of {{neutrality}} policy {{came with}} the Lend-Lease Act of March 1941, which allowed the U.S. to sell, lend or give war materials to nations the US <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> support.|$|R
25|$|Although in theory, Frondizi's <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid state intervention, and {{encourage}} a progressive social policy, {{it failed to}} democratize trade unions, most of whose leadership and systems were inherited from Perón's system.|$|R
50|$|During {{his years}} in Rome, Spellman befriended such figures as Gaetano Bisleti, Francesco Borgongini Duca and Domenico Tardini. He {{suffered}} from pneumonia, however, leaving his state of health so poor that the seminary <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> send him home. He nevertheless remained and managed to complete his theological studies.|$|R
2500|$|On 11 June 2014, Robert Blackwill, {{the former}} Coordinator for Strategic Planning and Deputy US National Security Advisor during the {{presidency}} of George W. Bush, spoke at length about India-US relations and said : [...] "Mr Modi is a determined leader. He is candid and frank. I also worked with him during the Gujarat earthquake when I was posted as (the US) ambassador to India. (...) It was mistake by the current Obama administration to delay engagement with Mr Modi. I {{do not know why}} they did so but definitely, this did not help in building relationship. (...) The old formula and stereotypes will not work if the US <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> engage with Mr Modi. The Indian prime minister is candid, direct and smart. He speaks his mind. The US administration also has to engage in candid conversation when Mr Modi meets President Obama later this year. They have to do something innovative to engage with him." ...|$|E

60|$|And here it may {{be worth}} inquiring what are the true {{characteristics}} of a faction, or how {{it is to be}} distinguished from that great body {{of the people who are}} friends to the constitution? The heads of a faction, are usually a set of upstarts, or men ruined in their fortunes, whom some great change in a government, did at first, out of their obscurity produce upon the stage. They associate themselves with those who dislike the old establishment, religious and civil. They are full of new schemes in politics and divinity; they have an incurable hatred against the old nobility, and strengthen their party by dependants raised from the lowest of the people; they have several ways of working themselves into power; but they are sure to be called when a corrupt <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be supported, against those who are endeavouring at a reformation; and they firmly observe that celebrated maxim of preserving power by the same arts it is attained. They act with the spirit of those who believe their time is but short; and their first care is to heap up immense riches at the public expense; in which they have two ends, beside that common one of insatiable avarice; which are, to make themselves necessary, and to keep the Commonwealth in dependence: Thus they hope to compass their design, which is, instead of fitting their principles to the constitution, to alter and adjust the constitution to their own pernicious principles.|$|E
50|$|The {{model was}} named after {{the conduct of the}} America's {{continuing}} conflict in Yemen. America needed to minimize the ability of the powerful Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group to attack the American homeland, while at the same time, the Obama <b>Administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> commit as few resources to the fight as possible.|$|R
50|$|Building {{from the}} 1988 cease fire agreement, the Bush <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} {{a negotiated settlement}} to end the fighting between Contras and Sandinistas. This would allow the Contras to return to Nicaragua and compete in open elections. They supported upcoming agreements in February 1989 and August 1989 that defined the plan to end the conflict.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the same}} {{scenario}} occurred in 2012. The Al-Arabi <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> naturalize him {{so they could}} have an extra foreign player in their squad {{to participate in the}} AFC Champions League. Despite reports of Pisculichi's ineligibility being readily available, they continued with the naturalization process. He did not gain Qatari citizenship and the club's management were criticized by local media.|$|R
50|$|In January 2017, it was {{announced}} that Phases 2 and 3 of the subway were among the 50 most important transportation projects nationwide that the Trump <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> build.

50|$|The island's {{government}} is trying to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene, passing rules including the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest, and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star.

5000|$|In early 2012, as the Obama {{administration}} {{prepared to}} try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Waxman said on NPR it would [...] "be a big year for military commissions. ... The Obama administration is taking ownership of military commissions .... They are basically saying: We've corrected {{the problems of}} the Bush administration, and we're now going to use this as a tool in combating terrorism .... There are a lot of doubters out there who see military justice and the military commission system as tainted or illegitimate .... The Obama <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> turn around that perception." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{dismissal}} of each individual U.S. Attorney were unclear. Two suggested motivations were that the <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make room for U.S. Attorneys who would be more sympathetic to the administration's political agenda, and the <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> advance the careers of promising conservatives.Critics said that the attorneys were fired for failing to prosecute Democratic politicians, for failing to prosecute claims of election fraud that would hamper Democratic voter registration, as retribution for prosecuting Republican politicians, or for failing to pursue adult obscenity prosecutions.The administration and its supporters said that the attorneys were dismissed for job-performance reasons [...] "related to policy, priorities and management", and that U.S. Attorneys serve {{at the pleasure of}} the President. However, at least six attorneys had recently received positive evaluations of their performance from the Department of Justice. In September 2008, the Department of Justice Inspector General's investigation concluded that the dismissals were politically motivated and improper.|$|R
5000|$|That is the {{consistent}} theme of reports in The New York Times {{in a piece}} by Seymour Hersh, and in a series by Murray Waas and Douglas Frantz in The Los Angeles Times .... In 1982 the Reagan <b>Administration,</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> prevent Saddam Hussein's defeat in the war with Iran, decided to provide him with secret intelligence. The intelligence helped Iraq learn the disposition of Iranian forces.|$|R
50|$|The Dingley Act of 1897 (ch. 11, , July 24, 1897), {{introduced}} by U.S. Representative Nelson Dingley, Jr., of Maine, raised tariffs in United States {{to counteract the}} Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, which had lowered rates. Came into effect under William McKinley the first year {{that he was in}} office. The McKinley <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> slowly bring back the protectionism that was proposed by the Tariff of 1890.|$|R

5000|$|Perry {{criticized the}} Obama administration's {{announcement}} on December 6, 2011, that the United States would initiate {{the use of}} foreign aid for promoting homosexual rights across the world. Perry spoke out against the measure, saying, [...] "Just when you thought Barack Obama couldn't get any more {{out of touch with}} America’s values, AP reports his <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights. This administration's war on traditional American values must stop." [...] During his speech, Perry called homosexuality a [...] "deeply objectionable" [...] lifestyle and firmly objected to any effort by the Obama administration to encroach on traditional family values.|$|E
5000|$|On July 9, 2006 The Jurist {{reported}} that DOD spokesmen {{have claimed that}} the dead men received assistance from others. Further, the DOD claims that preparations for the hangings were written on the blank paper issued to the detainees' lawyers. As part of the investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the camp authorities seized almost all the documents from almost all the detainees, a total of half a ton of papers, including their privileged, confidential communications with their lawyers. The <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> suspend all lawyers' visits, while a commission reviews the papers for any sign that the detainees' lawyers helped plan the suicides. (Note: The NCIS heavily redacted report was released publicly in August 2008.) ...|$|E
50|$|Medzhybizh was astride an {{important}} east-west supply road that the German occupant's <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> expand into an autobahn-like highway. This road led directly {{between the city}} of Proskuriv (now Khmelnytskyi) and routes westward into Germany {{and the city of}} Vinnytsia with routes to the eastern front. Vinnytsia was the site of Hitler's headquarters bunker in Soviet territory where he personally directed the war between 1942 and 1943.|$|R
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, the Federal government adopted a tough attitude toward the rebels. The Lincoln <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid any action that might appear as an official recognition of the Confederate government in Richmond, including the formal transfer of military captives. In the North, public opinion on prisoner exchanges began to soften after the First Battle of Bull Run, when the rebels captured about one thousand Union soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decision}} to accept the SALT II provisions was also influenced by European allies to the United States. The United States had installed missile launch sites in several locations across Europe. [...] The Reagan <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that the}} worries of their European allies regarding arms control were put to rest. In order to do so, Reagan decided to continue following the plan until one he saw as more appropriate was developed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{officials}} said that {{the decision was made}} prior to Trump's participation in the G-20 summit and July 7 meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Several officials characterized the decision as a [...] "major concession" [...] to Russia, with one remarking: [...] "Putin won in Syria." [...] However, another official stated that ending the program was not a major concession due to Assad's recent victories in the Syrian Civil War, but rather [...] "a signal to Putin that the <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> improve ties to Russia." [...] Some members of the Obama administration reportedly had wished to scrap the program because some rebels armed and trained by the program had joined ISIL and related groups.|$|E

50|$|Although the Roosevelt <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{enter the}} war against Germany, the vast {{majority}} of Americans were too isolationist and disillusioned at their experience in World War I to seek involvement in the World War II, at least until the U.S. was attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941. Once involved, the US became pivotal to the war effort and therefore European politics.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the report}} dealt with Donaldson's assertions of a conspired {{cover-up}} by the FBI and NTSB, in co-operation with the Justice Department. Donaldson believed that the Clinton <b>Administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hide the actual cause of the crash for political reasons, specifically the upcoming presidential elections. Donaldson concluded his report with the request that Congress hold Congressional hearings into the crash and/or request that the Justice Department appoint an Independent Counsel to investigate (neither of which happened).|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{compiling}} a 66-35 record and winning three PFL championships {{at a school}} that had only posted one winning season before his arrival, Bell's contract was not renewed after the 2015 season due to [...] "philosophical differences". [...] While the school's <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep the football program as-is, Bell had publicly mentioned his goal of eventually growing the non-scholarship Jacksonville program into a scholarship-based program which could better compete with other scholarship-supported programs in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).|$|R
50|$|By the evening, Vitali Klitschko had {{arranged}} a night-time meeting with President Viktor Yanukovych at his presidential mansion Mezhyhirya {{in an attempt}} to argue for snap elections in order to defuse the situation from escalating into further violence. The meeting ended with Yanukovych promising to resolve the crisis with a 'special commission' that includes representatives of the administration (including the president), Cabinet of Ministers, and political opposition. Arseniy Yatseniuk took to the Euromaidan stage at about 9:30 p.m. to explain that he received a telephone call from the President telling him the <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> start negotiations to end the political crisis. On Monday, 20 January, the commission was announced by Party of Regions MP Hanna Herman, but that it would convene without the presence of the President and be led by National Security and Defense Council secretary Andriy Klyuyev. Opposition leaders refused {{to take part in the}} government's proposed commission provided the president abstained from them himself.|$|E

5000|$|During the 2008 United States presidential {{election}} both (final) nominees for president, U.S. senator Barack Obama and U.S. senator John McCain, did offer backing to Ukraine's January 2008 membership proposal of NATO.Two weeks {{after a visit}} by President Obama to Russia in July 2009 Vice President Joe Biden visited Ukraine. During the visit Biden assured the Ukrainian government that the United States would continue to support Ukraine’s bid to join NATO despite Russia’s objections, [...] "the reset of relationship with Russia" [...] (that the Obama <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> pursue) will not come at Ukraine’s expense and Biden (once again) rejected {{the idea of a}} Russian [...] "sphere of influence": [...] "We do not recognize anyone else's right to dictate to you or any other country what alliances you will seek to belong to or what relationships you -- bilateral relationships you have".

5|$|The colonial <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{expand its}} {{influence}} around the river, particularly because {{the inhabitants of}} Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis.
