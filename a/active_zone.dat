5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an <b>active</b> <b>zone</b> of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E

Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 {{as part of the}} chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the <b>active</b> <b>zone</b> of the reactor during the breeding process.

Although twist mutant embryos lack mesoderm, motor axons still grow out of the CNS and form morphologically normal presynaptic <b>active</b> <b>zones,</b> independent of their target cells. In myoblast city mutant embryos, myoblasts do not fuse but form fully differentiated mononucleate muscles, which make functional neuromuscular synapses with correctly localized presynaptic <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> Myoblasts also fail to fuse but still attract appropriate innervation in mef 2 mutant embryos. However, these myoblasts fail to differentiate into muscles and presynaptic <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> fail to localize at neuromuscular contacts.

25|$|The {{synaptic}} ribbon is {{a unique}} structure at the <b>active</b> <b>zone</b> of the synapse. It is positioned several nanometers away from the pre-synaptic membrane and tethers 100 or more synaptic vesicles. Each pre-synaptic cell can have from 10 to 100 ribbons tethered at the membrane, or a total number of 1000–10000 vesicles {{in close proximity to}} active zones. The ribbon synapse was first identified in the retina as a thin, ribbon-like presynaptic projection surrounded by a halo of vesicles using transmission electron microscopy in the 1950s, as the technique was gaining mainstream usage.|$|E

Several major faults rive these highlands, but much of Belize lies outside the tectonically <b>active</b> <b>zone</b> that underlies most of Central America.

25|$|The ribbon synapse {{is a type}} of {{neuronal}} synapse {{characterized by}} the presence of an electron-dense structure, the synaptic ribbon, that holds vesicles close to the <b>active</b> <b>zone.</b> It is characterized by a tight vesicle-calcium channel coupling that promotes rapid neurotransmitter release and sustained signal transmission. Ribbon synapses undergo a cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis in response to graded changes of membrane potential. It has been proposed that most ribbon synapses undergo a special type of exocytosis based on coordinated multivesicular release. This interpretation has recently been questioned at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse, where it has been instead proposed that exocytosis is described by uniquantal (i.e., univesicular) release shaped by a flickering vesicle fusion pore.|$|E
40|$|A new QM/MM {{molecular}} dynamics approach that {{can deal with}} the dynamics of large real systems involving several simultaneous <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> is presented. Multiple, unconnected but interacting quantum regions are treated independently in an ordinary QM/MM approach but in a manner which converges to a unique simulation. The multiple <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> in the hybrid QM/MM {{molecular dynamics}} methodology (maz-QM/MM MD) involve molecular dynamics that is driving the whole simulation with several parallel executions of energy gradients within the QM/MM approach that merge into each MD step. The Ewald-summation method is used to incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions among the <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> in conjunction with periodic boundary conditions. To illustrate and ascertain capabilities and limitations, we present several benchmark calculations using this approach.

40|$|SummarySynaptic {{transmission}} {{requires the}} localization of presynaptic release machinery to <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> Mechanisms regulating {{the abundance of}} such synaptic proteins at individual release sites are likely determinants of site-specific synaptic efficacy. We now identify a role for the small GTPase Rab 3 in regulating the distribution of presynaptic components to <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> At Drosophila rab 3 mutant NMJs, the presynaptic protein Bruchpilot, calcium channels, and electron-dense T bars are concentrated {{at a fraction of}} available <b>active</b> <b>zones,</b> leaving the majority of sites devoid of these key presynaptic release components. Late addition of Rab 3 to mutant NMJs rapidly reverses this phenotype by recruiting Brp to sites previously lacking the protein, demonstrating that Rab 3 can dynamically control the composition of the presynaptic release machinery. While previous studies of Rab 3 have focused on its role in the synaptic vesicle cycle, these findings demonstrate an additional and unexpected function for Rab 3 in the localization of presynaptic proteins to <b>active</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
40|$|Electrical resonance, {{which in}} some hair cells {{provides}} a mechanism for frequency tuning, is mediated by clusters of Ca 2 + channels and Ca(2 +) -activated K+ channels that have been proposed to occur at presynaptic <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> To localize Ca 2 + channels on the cellular surface, we loaded hair cells from the frog's sacculus with the Ca 2 + indicator fluo- 3 and imaged them by fluorescence confocal microscopy. When a cell was depolarized, we observed on its basolateral surface several foci of transiently enhanced fluorescence due to local Ca 2 + influx. After protracted recording, each cell displayed on average 18 brightly and permanently fluorescent spots at the same positions. We mapped these spots in four hair cells and compared their locations with those of presynaptic <b>active</b> <b>zones,</b> as determined from transmission electron micrographs of serial sections through the same cells. The results demonstrated that enhanced fluo- 3 fluorescence marks <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> Measurement of currents through membrane patches at fluorescently labeled <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> demonstrated that both voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels and Ca(2 +) -activated K+ channels occur there.

25|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{provided}} evidence that loss-of-function mutations in pre-synaptic proteins of the photoreceptor cells ribbon synapse can cause X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) through mutations in the CACNA1F gene, which codes for the αF1-subunit of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.4. The gene is expressed at the <b>active</b> <b>zone</b> of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. The mutation {{is characterized by a}} significant reduction in both night and variable perturbation of daylight vision. The mutations in CACNA1F and Cav1.4 have also been observed to co-localize with CaBP4, a photoreceptor-specific calcium-binding protein. CaBP4 has been theorized to modulate the activity of the Cav1.4 channel. It has been theorized {{to be associated with the}} proper establishment and maintenance of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. While no evidence has been published, the association between CaBP4 and Cav1.4 is an area of continued research.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It sticks {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the <b>active</b> <b>zone.</b> They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the <b>active</b> <b>zone.</b> The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E
40|$|Black widow spider venom (BWSV) {{was applied}} to frog nerve-muscle {{preparations}} bathed in Ca 2 +-containing, or Ca 2 +-free, solutions and the neuromuscular junctions were studied by the freeze-fracture technique. When BWSV was applied for short periods (10 - 15 min) {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 +, numerous dimples (P face) or protuberances (E face) appeared on the presynaptive membrane and approximately 86 % were located immediately adjacent to the double rows of large intramembrane particles that line the <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> When BWSV was applied for 1 h in the presence of Ca 2 +, the nerve terminals were depleted of vesicles, few dimples or protuberances were seen, and the <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> were almost completely disorganized. The P face of the presynaptic membrane still contained large intramembrane particles. When muscles were soaked for 2 - 3 h in Ca 2 +-free solutions, the <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> became disorganized, and isolated remnants of the double rows of particles were found scattered over the P face of the presynaptic membrane. When BWSV {{was applied to}} these preparations, dimples or protuberances occurred almost exclusively alongside disorganized <b>active</b> <b>zones</b> or alongside dispersed fragments of the <b>active</b> <b>zones.</b> The loss of synaptic vesicles from terminals treated with BWSV probably occurs because BWSV interferes with the endocytosis of vesicle membrane. Therefore, we assume that the dimples or protuberances seen on these terminals identify the sites of exocytosis, and we conclude that exocytosis can occur mostly in the immediate vicinity of the large intramembrane particles. Extracellular Ca 2 + seems to be required to maintain the grouping of the large particles into double rows at the <b>active</b> <b>zones,</b> but is not required for these particles to specify the sites of exocytosis...|$|R

(232Th follows the same decay chain, but its much longer half-life means that the quantities of 208Tl produced are negligible.) These impurities of 232U make 233U easy to detect and dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of nuclear proliferation using 233U as the fissile material. 233Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27days and a high cross section for neutron capture. Thus it is a neutron poison: instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233U, {{a significant amount of}} 233Pa converts to 234U and consumes neutrons, degrading the reactor efficiency.
