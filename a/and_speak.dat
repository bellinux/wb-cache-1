40|$|In this paper, {{acoustic}} cues {{and human}} capability for discriminating singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices are discussed {{to develop an}} automatic discrimination system for singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices. Based {{on the results of}} preliminary subjective experiments, listeners discriminate between singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices with 70. 0 % accuracy for 200 ms signals and 99. 7 % for one-second signals. Since even short stimuli of 200 ms can be correctly discriminated, not only temporal characteristics but also short-time spectral features can be cues for discrimination. To examine how listeners distinguish between these two voices, we conducted subjective experiments with singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voice stimuli whose voice quality and prosody were systematically distorted by using signal processing techniques. The experimental results suggest that spectral and prosodic cues complementarily contributed to perceptual judgments. Furthermore, a software system that can automatically discriminate between singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices <b>and</b> such performances is also reported...|$|R

25|$|Kroll {{used the}} four phases {{to give an}} {{explanation}} and generalise {{about the development of}} these two aspects of language. The highest significance is placed on the second and third phase, consolidation and differentiation respectively. It could be concluded that children's written <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> language, in certain respects, become more similar to age, maturation, and experience; however, they are also increasingly different in other respects. The content of the skills are more similar, but the approach used for both writing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> are different.

To this end, 75 female Iranian EFL learners, assumed homogenous based on their performance on the Nelson Test, were employed as the participants.

The focus of the present study was to explore Bangladesh secondary English teachers’ understandings about listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> skills assessment as well as to learn the barriers and enablers they encounter in assessing those two skills. The study showed that the Bangladesh secondary English curriculum does not include the assessment of listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> skills, although the curriculum document gives a mandate to teachers to practise and assess all the four language skills – listening, <b>speaking,</b> reading, <b>and</b> writing. The study also indicated that teachers taught English mixing with Bangla language; they had not been trained to assess listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> skills; the English curriculum required restructuring to make way for listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> skills assessment; teachers needed listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> resources to enable them to undertake both listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> practices <b>and</b> assessment; and above all, it shows that the teachers need instruction from the education authority in order to start auraloral skills assessment in schools.
