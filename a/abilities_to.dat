40|$|Objective: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) {{from human}} serum and detect its binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{several kinds of}} {{bacteria}} common in infectious diseases of children. Methods: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4 B column. Its binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results: MBL has different binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bacteria and shows strong binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. Conclusions: MBL has different binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> Gram-negative bacteria.

5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E
