5|$|The {{discovery}} in 2017 {{of a third}} species, P. tapanuliensis, from Sumatra south of Lake Toba, came with <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> twist: it is {{more closely related to}} the Bornean species, P. pygmaeus than to its fellow Sumatran species, P. abelii.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Taylor secured just 2,383 more votes than Goebel. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly {{challenged}} the election results. Under the Goebel Election Law, a three-man Board of Elections (dominated by Democrats) were {{to review the}} results and certify the winner in the contest. Two {{of the members of}} the board had openly campaigned for Goebel, and all three owed their appointments to him, but in <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> decision, the board voted 2—1 to certify Taylor as the winner.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1917, he was {{temporarily}} placed {{in command of}} his battalion's South Australian-raised sister unit of the 3rd Brigade, the 10th Battalion. After briefly returning to his old unit on 6 July, he took command of the 10th Battalion with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 15 July. This was considered <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> promotion, as {{at the time he}} was junior to forty majors then in the AIF.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the classes of the RMS, the Free Music School, which emphasised choral singing, was also formed. Both the classes and the school quickly became popular. <b>As</b> <b>surprising</b> {{as the number of}} students who enrolled was their extreme diversity. Bureaucrats, merchants, tradesmen and university students attended, as well as many young women who lacked the means to study privately.|$|R

5|$|On 5 April 1974 a {{coalition}} government was finally established by a royal decree with Souvanna as president. Due to the defeatism and political deterioration of the rightists within the kingdom, the Pathet Lao moved adroitly, slowly preempting the government and military and soon winning <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> popularity among the Lao population.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{has several}} {{unrelated}} sub-plots. In the episode, Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) throws Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> relationship curveball as the CIA orders Vivian Volkoff (Lauren Cohan) assassinated. In order to prove Vivian's innocence, Chuck must put his trust {{in a dangerous}} allyVivian's father Alexei (Timothy Dalton). Meanwhile, Ellie Bartowski-Woodcomb (Sarah Lancaster) suspects that her mother Mary (Linda Hamilton) is interfering with the search into her father Stephen's past.|$|E
5|$|A {{more careful}} project was {{undertaken}} between 2003 and 2008, with more effort made {{to place the}} stucco fragments. There is evidence of multiple phases of occupation with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and human figures and epigraphy. Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.|$|E

50|$|The region {{includes}} several small mountain ranges including the Chiricahua Mountains, Huachuca Mountains, Santa Ritas, the Santa Catalinas, the Rincons, the Piñalenos, and others. <b>As</b> <b>surprising</b> {{as it might}} seem, some of these mountains are high enough, cold enough, and wet enough in the wintertime to provide alpine skiing at regular ski resorts, with ski lifts, not very distant from cities such as Tucson.|$|R

5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} rounds, Garcia {{steadily}} pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was {{in serious trouble}} in rounds 5 and 6, then finally {{went down in the}} 8th. From there, things took <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, though his deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).|$|E
5|$|During {{the return}} from the Galápagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study {{had been one of}} the primary goals of the expedition. Searching for a way to satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same {{techniques}} to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Galápagos, Beebe encountered <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.|$|E

5|$|However, {{both he and}} Australia {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> {{string of}} poor results in the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series, Gilchrist managing an average of only 22.20 during the tournament. Australia won seven of their eight qualifying matches, but England won with two finals victories over the Australians. Gilchrist scored 60 and 61 {{in the first two}} matches but did not pass 30 thereafter. He was then rested for Australia's winless three-match ODI tour of New Zealand, before his selection for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Having previously indicated that it was highly likely that he would retire after the 2007 World Cup, he then stated a desire to play on aftwerwards.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004–2005 season, having aged out of {{the junior}} level at age 19, Evan Lysacek made his senior {{international}} debut. Skating through a hip injury, Lysacek placed fifth at the 2004 Skate America, the first Grand Prix event of his career. He repeated that placement {{a few weeks later}} at the 2004 Cup of Russia. At the 2005 U.S. Championships, Lysacek won the bronze medal after receiving the only 6.0 of his career for his short program. He went on to win his first senior international title at the 2005 Four Continents. He competed next at the 2005 World Championships in Moscow. There, he won <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> bronze medal at his first senior World Championships, a competition for which his goal had been only to qualify for the free skate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} finals, Liukin {{displayed}} a beautiful routine to earn <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> bronze medal on floor exercise {{with a score}} of 15.425, behind Shawn Johnson, with 15.500, and Romanian Sandra Izbasa, with 15.650. On uneven bars, Liukin and China's He Kexin both posted final marks of 16.725 and earned identical A- and B-panel scores of 7.70 and 9.025, respectively. However, He Kexin won the gold medal, and Liukin was awarded the silver, after a tie-breaking calculation that took into account individual marks given by judges on the B-panel. In the balance beam final, Liukin scored 16.025 to claim silver behind Shawn Johnson's 16.225. With her fifth Beijing medal, Liukin tied Mary Lou Retton and Shannon Miller for the most gymnastics medals won by an American in a single Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Racing veteran Jarno Trulli (Trulli GP) {{started in}} the first group, as {{qualifying}} began at 12:00, and posted a strong time of 1:21.547 early in the session, being the first to lap the course in under 1:22. Also in the group was Nelson Piquet, Jr.– second in the championship– who ultimately managed only 13th place on the grid. As qualifying progressed, championship leader Lucas di Grassi and Monaco winner Sébastien Buemi came close to beating Trulli's time, but proved unable to do so, handing Trulli <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> pole position, his first in Formula E.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{intensive}} bombing worried the authorities and 'Mass-Observation' was deployed to gauge attitudes and provide policy suggestions, as before the war they had investigated local attitudes to anti-Semitism. The organisation noted that close family and friendship links within the East End were providing the population with <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> resilience under fire. Propaganda was issued, reinforcing {{the image of the}} 'brave chirpy Cockney'. On the Sunday after the Blitz began, Winston Churchill himself toured the bombed areas of Stepney and Poplar. Anti-aircraft installations were built in public parks, such as Victoria Park and the Mudchute on the Isle of Dogs, and along the line of the Thames, as this was used by the aircraft to guide them to their target.|$|E
