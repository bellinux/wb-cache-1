New experiments, however, require more stringent position control more frequently than can be done manually for long periods of time.

40|$|A 1. 5 -GeV Fixed-Field Alternating-Gradient (FFAG) proton Accelerator {{is being}} studied {{as a new}} {{injector}} to the Alternating-Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The major benefit {{is that it would}} considerably shorten the overall AGS acceleration cycle, and, consequently, may yield to an improvement of beam stability, intensity and size. The AGS-FFAG, as we shall call the new injector, will also facilitate the proposed upgrade of the AGS facility toward a 1 -MW average proton beam power at the top energy of 28 GeV. This paper describes the FFAG design for acceleration of protons from 400 MeV to 1. 5 GeV, with the same circumference of the AGS, and entirely housed in the AGS tunnel. The lattice is a periodic sequence of FDF triplets of combined-function <b>magnets.</b> An <b>adjusted</b> <b>magnet</b> field profile has been calculated to compensate the variation of the main lattice functions with momentum. At injection, a 1. 0 -ms long beam pulse of negative-ions (H–) is stacked using the charge-exchange method. Acceleration of one pulse with 1. 0 x 1014 protons takes about 7. 0 msec. The beam is transferred in one single turn from the FFAG to the AGS...|$|R
40|$|Unlike present {{constant}} model feedback systems, {{neural networks}} can adapt as {{the dynamics of}} the process changes with time. Using a process model, the “Accelerator ” network is first trained to simulate {{the dynamics of the}} beam for a given beam line. This “Accelerator ” network is then used to train a second “Controller ” network which performs the control function. In simulation, the networks are used to <b>adjust</b> corrector <b>magnets</b> to control the launch angle and position of the beam to keep it on the desired trajectory when the incoming beam is perturbed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the quality and {{stability}} of synchrotron light, Hefei Light Source has a major upgrade. Higher accuracy is necessary for installation and alignment of the storage ring magnets. It is not necessarily essential that the magnets are positioned exactly. In fact, the aim is to <b>adjust</b> neighboring <b>magnets</b> with a high accuracy to one another; in other words, these neighboring magnets are positioned on a smoothing curve. The paper presents an attempt to develop a reliable smoothing method based on curve fitting of least squares and iteration according to the structure characteristics of HLSII. The method significantly reduces the adjusting amount and range of the storage ring magnets. It improves productivity by a factor of one times. Comment: 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{deviation}} errors {{caused by}} magnetism in the ship's structure are minimised by precisely positioning small magnets and iron compensators {{close to the}} compass. To compensate for the induced magnetization, two magnetically soft iron spheres are placed on side arms. However, because the magnetic [...] "signature" [...] of every ship changes slowly with location, and with time, {{it is necessary to}} <b>adjust</b> the compensating <b>magnets,</b> periodically, to keep the deviation errors to a practical minimum. Magnetic compass adjustment and correction is one of the subjects in the examination curriculum for a shipmaster's certificate of competency.|$|R

In general, {{it is very difficult}} to <b>adjust</b> the undulator <b>magnet</b> alignment after the HTS magnetization since the entire undulator is installed inside a cryostat. The appropriate HTS alignment has to be determined in the design stage. This paper presents the development of a numerical simulation code for magnetization process of the Pure-type HTS undulator to assist the design of the optimal size and alignment of the HTS magnets...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the emittance at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), we measure and correct the orbit, dispersion, and transverse coupling of the beam. However, this method is limited by finite measurement resolution of the dispersion, and so a new procedure must be used to further reduce the emittance due to dispersion. In order to achieve this, we use a method based upon the theory of sloppy models. We use {{a model of the}} accelerator to create the Hessian matrix which encodes the effects of various corrector magnets on the vertical emittance. A singular value decomposition of this matrix yields the magnet combinations which have the greatest effect on the emittance. We can then <b>adjust</b> these <b>magnet</b> "knobs" sequentially in order to decrease the dispersion and the emittance. We present here comparisons of the effectiveness of this procedure in both experiment and simulation using a variety of CESR lattices. We also discuss techniques to minimize changes to parameters we have already corrected. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, presented at IPAC 201...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the recent efforts {{in establishing a}} consistent basis for beam physics simulations and machine requirements, magnet design and manufacture, and magnetic measurements. Magnetic field measurements serve for the quality assurance of the magnet production, and for validating numerical field simulation (FEM) tools and magnet design techniques. In order to study {{the performance of the}} accelerator and to allocate a budget for magnet misalignment in the tunnel, the beam physicists require the field maps and multipole field errors of the magnet system, either from validated numerical models or from magnetic measurements. When dynamic effects in the magnet exceed the capability of numerical simulations, online field measurements are done for monitoring of the magnet behavior and thus providing direct feedback to the accelerator control room for <b>adjusting</b> the <b>magnet</b> current cycles, and to tune the high-frequency accelerator cavities. The paper {{describes the}} approaches and techniques in magnetic field measurements and numerical field computations, discusses their limitations and attempts to make them consistent with the requirements from beam physics and magnet design...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{monitoring}} the luminosity {{has been developed}} at CESR. The method involves shaking one bunch at a specific frequency and observing the resulting oscillations of the corresponding opposing bunch. In initial tests, measurements with 1 % accuracy have been obtained in 1 second. Measurements of different bunches in a train shows bunch to bunch differences with the optimum luminosity conditions for one bunch not coinciding with the optimum for another. 1 Introduction In a colliding beam storage ring {{it is essential to}} be able to monitor the luminosity so as to be able to <b>adjust</b> machine elements (<b>magnets,</b> separators, etc.) to maximize the luminosity. Two methods that are used at the Cornell Electron/positron Storage Ring CESR involve measuring the vertical oe [...] tune split and counting babas using the CLEO detector. The problem with the former method is that the mode is not always cleanly visible on a spectrum analyzer. On the other hand, the latter method is slow since the c [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} correcting coils behavior used to homogenize the field distribution of the race-track microtron accelerator end magnets. These end magnets belong to {{the second stage of}} the 30. 0 MeV cw electron accelerator under construction at IFUSP, the race-track microtron booster, in which the beam energy is raised from 1. 97 to 5. 1 MeV. The correcting coils are attached to the pole faces and are based on the inhomogeneities of the magnetic field measured. The performance of these coils, when operating the end magnets with currents that differ by ± 10 % from the one used in the mappings that originated the coils copper leads, is presented. For one of the <b>magnets,</b> <b>adjusting</b> conveniently the current of the correcting coils makes it possible to homogenize field distributions of different intensities, once their shapes are practically identical to those that originated the coils. For the other one, the shapes are changed and the coils are less efficient. This is related to intrinsic factors that determine the inhomogeneities. However, we obtained uniformity of 0. 001 % in both cases. © 1998 The American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadvertent {{adjustments}} and malfunctions of programmable valves {{have been}} reported in cases in which patients have encountered powerful electromagnetic fields such as those involved in magnetic resonance imaging, but the potential effects of magnetic toys on programmable valves are not well known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The magnetic properties of nine toy magnets were examined. To calculate the effect of a single magnet over a distance, the magnetic flux density was directly measured using a calibrated Hall probe at seven different positions between 0 and 120 mm from the magnet. Strata II small (Medtronic Inc.), Codman Hakim (Codman & Shurtleff), and Polaris (Sophysa) programmable valves were then tested {{to determine the effects of}} the toy magnets on each valve type. RESULTS: The maximal flux density of different magnetic toys differed between 17 and 540 mT, inversely proportional to the distance between toy and measurement instrument. Alterations to Strata and Codman valve settings could be effected with all the magnetic toys. The distances that still led to an alteration of the valve settings differed from 10 to 50 mm (Strata), compared with 5 to 30 mm (Codman). Valve settings of Polaris could not be altered by any toy at any distance due to its architecture with two <b>magnets</b> <b>adjusted</b> in opposite directions. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing changes in the pressure setting of some adjustable valves caused by magnetic toys in close contact. Parents, surgeons, neurologists, pediatric oncologists, and paramedics should be informed about the potential dangers of magnetic toys to prevent unwanted changes to pressure settings...|$|R
