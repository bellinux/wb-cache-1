25|$|Kipling's birth home on {{the campus}} of the J J School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the Dean's residence. Although the cottage bears a plaque noting it as the site where Kipling was born, the {{original}} cottage may have been torn down decades ago and a new one built in its place. Some historians and conservationists are also of the view that the bungalow marks a site that is merely close to the home of Kipling's birth, as the bungalow was built in 1882—about 15 years after Kipling was born.

25|$|A factor {{from which}} the {{intention}} to evade or delay payment may be inferred is that the debtor made an appointment to make a payment and then departed without keeping it. In Abell v Strauss, Abel applied to sequestrate the estate of Strauss, a taxi driver, {{on the ground that}} he had committed an act of insolvency in terms of section 8(a), in that he had departed from his dwelling with the intention of evading or delaying the payment of his debts. The court considered that Strauss’s frequent absences from his dwelling might be attributed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demands of his occupation as to an intention to avoid payment. In the court’s view, it could not be inferred that Strauss had committed the act of insolvency alleged.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology {{arose from}} the field of {{zymotechnology}} or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, brewing contributed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government. In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.|$|E

Following the opening instrumental passage, the song begins with a chorus in which he first pleads for a life devoid of the karmic burden of rebirth, or reincarnation: [...] "Give me love, give me love, give me peace on earth / Give me light, give me life, keep me free from birth." [...] These lyrics bear a simple, universal message, one that, {{in the context of}} the time, related <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communal [...] "peace and love" [...] idealism of the 1960s as it did Harrison's personal spiritual quest.|$|E

[...] The 2009 book Vintage Games contrasted Dragon Warrior to the 1986 NES title The Legend of Zelda; it said, while both titles share common RPG elements, Zelda features a fantasy setting and magic but no level or turn-based combat system, and Dragon Warrior features both. Nintendo Power said the game's historical significance is its greatest aspect, and noted that [...] "playing Dragon Warrior these days can {{be a bit of a}} chore". GamePro wrote that their favorite aspect of the game was the Elizabethan-English dialogue, and that they were disappointed by its removal in the GBC remake.|$|E

25|$|Spencer {{followed}} Comte in {{aiming for}} the unification of scientific truth; {{it was in this}} sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organic realm <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inorganic, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> human mind <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended <b>to</b> demonstrate <b>the</b> existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held {{that it was possible to}} discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man.|$|R
500|$|Boniface {{seems to}} have been unable to correct his {{misunderstanding}} of the meaning of the Libellus on this point. But this was perhaps due <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that seventh- and eighth-century canonical authorities (especially popes) so frequently conflicted on this subject, as to Boniface's own interpretative error. In a long series of letters written to subsequent bishops of Rome — Pope Gregory II, Pope Gregory III, Pope Zachary — Boniface periodically brought up the issue of consanguinity and marriage, and each time he received a slightly different answer as to what was permitted and what was prohibited. Suspicion about the authenticity of the Libellus {{seems to have}} ended with Boniface's death in 754, though misinterpretation of its chapter on consanguinity continued for long after that. Nevertheless, no medieval authority except Boniface is on record as ever having questioned the authenticity of the Libellus and its marriage chapter. In fact, there arose a vigorous tradition of forged documents that defended the authenticity of the Libellus and attempted to explain why it permitted, or (to those who followed the [...] "Roman" [...] system) seemed to permit, nieces to marry their uncles, or even first cousins to marry.|$|E
500|$|In his {{foreword}} to John Marriott's book, Thunderbirds Are Go!, Anderson {{put forward}} several {{explanations for the}} series' enduring popularity: it [...] "contains elements that appeal to most children– danger, jeopardy and destruction.

[...] According to Anderson, Thunderbirds incorporates a [...] "strong family atmosphere, where Dad reigns supreme". Both O'Brien and script editor Alan Pattillo have praised the series' positive [...] "family values". In addition, Heffer and others have written of its cross-generational appeal. In 2000, shortly before the series' BBC revival, Brian Viner remarked in Radio Times that Thunderbirds was {{on the point of}} [...] "captivating yet another generation of viewers". Stuart Hood, writing for The Spectator in 1965, praised Thunderbirds as a [...] "modern fairy tale"; adding that it [...] "can sometimes be frightening", he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents. Writing for Dreamwatch in 1994, Andrew Thomas described Thunderbirds as only [...] "nominally" [...] a children's programme: [...] "Its themes are universal and speak <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adult in the child as the child in the adult." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Pitchforks Ryan Dombal, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was [...] "a hedonistic {{exploration}} into a rich and famous American id", while Chris Martins from Spin {{said it was an}} alternately grandiose and eloquent production that [...] "owed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> artist's self-aggrandizing ego as to the voracious id that would destroy it publicly". Music writer Ann Powers interprets West's predominant theme on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to be [...] "the crisis of the jet-lagged cosmopolitan ... the exhausted cry of one who's always new in town, chasing whatever goal or girl is in the room, fueled by consumer culture's relentless buzz, but finally left unsatisfied". Powers views the songs to work [...] "as pornographic boasts, romantic disaster stories, devil-haunted dark nights of the soul" [...] and perceives West's [...] "uncertainty about his own place in the world" [...] to be connected to the subject of race, stating [...] "The rootlessness West celebrates and despairs of on Fantasy belongs to someone who feels unwelcome everywhere. This isn't just a personal problem. It's the curse of what the author Michael Eric Dyson has called 'the exceptional black man', embraced for his talents but singled out for the color of his skin".|$|E

500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you without end / When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
