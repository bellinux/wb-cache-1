40|$|Many {{long-term}} monitoring {{sites in}} Antarctic regions, which deploy ground-based stratospheric remote sensors and fly radiosondes or ozonesondes on balloons, supported the <b>Airborne</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Experiment</b> in September and October 1999. Support consisted of supplying {{data to the}} campaign in real time, {{and in some cases}} by increasing the frequency of measurements during the campaign. The results will strengthen scientific conclusions from the airborne measurements. But results from these sites are allowing important scientific studies of new aspects of the ozone hole in their own right, because like the aircraft and its campaign, many sites traverse the vortex edge and are close to the largest source of lee waves, or measure infrequently observed trace gases such as HNO 3. Examples of such studies are the behaviour and value of NO 2 in midwinter, ozone filamentation with no apparent horizontal advection, the frequency and amplitude of gravity waves over the Antarctic Peninsula, mixing in the lowest stratosphere in Antarctic spring, the mechanism and frequency of HNO 3 enhancement above the ozone peak in midwinter, and trends in UV dose in southern South America...|$|E

Three test flights were carried out at Pratica di Mare, and seven scientific mission flights during APE 1, when “quasi-Lagrangian” flight paths (flights in the wind direction, assuming the stratosphere to be stationary over the flight period) and lee wave flight paths were employed. Combined sorties of the M- 55 Geophysica and the DLR Falcon were performed, the latter acting as a pathfinder for the former, guiding it to small regions of intense polar stratospheric cloud activity. These small cloud patches are associated with intense atmospheric wave activity over the Scandinavian mountains and other mountain ranges, and have been implicated in the observed depletion of stratospheric ozone.

These are measure-ments of particle size distributions with a laser optical particle counter of the FSSP- 300 type operated during 9 flights on the Russian M- 55 high-altitude research aircraft Geophysika. For specific flights, the FSSP- 300 measurements are compared with balloon-borne data (launched from Kiruna, Sweden). It was found that the stratospheric aerosol content reached levels well below the background concentrations measured by the NASA operated ER- 2 in 1988 / 89 in the northern hemisphere. During the APE campaign, no PSC particle formation was observed at flight altitudes although the temperatures were below the NAT condensation point during one flight. The measured correlations between ozone and aerosol give an indication of the subsidence inside the 1996 / 97 polar vortex.

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} and statistical analyses are {{conducted to determine}} the skill of different Lagrangian techniques {{for the construction of}} tracer distributions. High-resolution potential vorticity (PV) maps are calculated from simulations of the 1996 / 97 arctic winter stratospheric dynamics using two different numerical schemes—reverse domain filling trajectories (RDF) and contour advection with surgery (CAS) —and data from three meteorological agencies (NCEP, the Met Office, and ECMWF). The PV values are then converted into ozone (O 3) concentrations and statistically compared to in situ O 3 data measured by the electro chemical ozone cell (ECOC) instrument during the <b>Airborne</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Experiment</b> (APE) using cross correlation, rms differences, and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. Results indicate that while Lagrangian techniques are successful in increasing the presence of lower-scale tracer structures with respect to the plain meteorological analyses, they significantly improve the statistical agreement between the simulated and the measured tracer profiles only when there is clear evidence of filaments in the measured data. This better fit is most clearly seen by using the KS test, rather than cross correlation. It is argued that this difference in the performance of Lagrangian techniques can be partly related to the treatment of mixing processes in the framework of the Lagrangian schemes. Statistical analyses also show that the temporal rather than the spatial resolution of the input meteorological fields, used to advect tracers, enhances the predictive skill of the Lagrangian products. The best overall performance is obtained with the Lagrangian product (not gridded) based on high-resolution reverse trajectories calculated along a flight track, in particular when the simulation is initialized with ECMWF data. Other products, such as CAS initialized with ECMWF and 3 D-gridded RDF initialized with the Met Office data, show fairly good performances, thus with lower statistical confidence...|$|E

The light scattered from polar angles from 3. 49 ° to 169 ° is reflected onto a circular array of 33 photodiodes.

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of angular scattering intensities (ASIs) related to single ice crystals of cirrus clouds {{were obtained for}} the first time with the <b>airborne</b> <b>Polar</b> Nephelometer instrument. These observations were performed in the southern mid-latitudes during the INCA project. The analysis of the data shows that the well marked peaks of the ASIs are undoubtedly attributed to quasi-specular reflections from crystal facets and the refracted rays passed through the ice crystals. Emphasizing that it is not enough to know the shape of the crystal, but also the internal structure is of great importance. Ray tracing simulations reproduce most of the observed ASIs features. The model of surface roughness, which assumes the Weibull statistics, enables to reproduce the quasi-specular external reflection from crystal facets.

The results show that quasi-spherical ice particles with diameter smaller than 5 µm control the optical properties of the plume shortly after formation. In slightly aged contrails the optical properties are governed by larger nonspherical ice-crystals. Very similar optical properties are observed in frontal cirrus but with a different ice-particle size distribution.

40|$|In {{order to}} quantitatively analyse the {{chemical}} and dynamical evolution of the polar vortex it has proven extremely useful to work with coordinate systems that follow the vortex flow. We propose here a two-dimensional quasi-Lagrangian coordinate system { χ i, Δ χ i }, based on the mixing ratio of a long-lived stratospheric trace gas i, and its systematic use with i = N 2 O, in order to describe {{the structure of a}} well-developed Antarctic polar vortex. In the coordinate system { χ i, Δ χ i } the mixing ratio χ i is the vertical coordinate and Δ χ i = χ i (Θ) − χ i vort (Θ) is the meridional coordinate (χ i vort (Θ) being a vertical reference profile in the vortex core). The quasi-Lagrangian coordinates { χ i, Δ χ i } persist for much longer time than standard isentropic coordinates, potential temperature Θ and equivalent latitude φ e, do not require explicit reference to geographic space, and can be derived directly from high-resolution in situ measurements. They are therefore well-suited for studying the evolution of the Antarctic polar vortex throughout the polar winter with respect to the relevant chemical and microphysical processes. By using the introduced coordinate system { χ N 2 O, Δ χ N 2 O } we analyze the well-developed Antarctic vortex investigated during the APE-GAIA (<b>Airborne</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Experiment</b> – Geophysica Aircraft in Antarctica – 1999) campaign (Carli et al., 2000). A criterion, which uses the local in-situ measurements of χ i = χ i (Θ) and attributes the inner vortex edge to a rapid change (δ -step) in the meridional profile of the mixing ratio χ i, is developed to determine the (Antarctic) inner vortex edge. In turn, we suggest that the outer vortex edge of a well-developed Antarctic vortex {{can be attributed to the}} position of a local minimum of the χ H 2 O gradient in the polar vortex area. For a well-developed Antarctic vortex, the Δ χ N 2 O -parametrization of tracer-tracer relationships allows to distinguish the tracer inter-relationships in the vortex core, vortex boundary region and surf zone and to examine their meridional variation throughout these regions. This is illustrated by analyzing the tracer-tracer relationships χ i : χ N 2 O obtained from the in-situ data of the APE-GAIA campaign for i = CFC- 11, CFC- 12, H- 1211 and SF 6. A number of solitary anomalous points in the CFC- 11 : N 2 O correlation, observed in the Antarctic vortex core, are interpreted in terms of small-scale cross-isentropic dispersion...|$|E

Basically, the probe measures the scattering phase function of an ensemble of cloud particles which intersect a collimated laser beam near {{the focal point of}} a paraboloidal mirror. From the measured scattering phase function the retrieval of the droplet-size spectra and subsequent derived quantities such as liquid water content and size parameters can be calculated using an inversion method. The particle phase discrimination (water droplets/ice particles) can be derived from the shape of the scattering phase function and the sensitivity of the probe allows the detection of small ice crystals (typically of 5 µm diameter). The paper describes the preliminary results obtained by the prototype version of the Polar Nephelometer in various cloudy conditions. These results are compared with direct microphysical measurements obtained by usual PMS probes also mounted in the wind tunnel.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{retrieval}} of aerosol optical and microphysical properties from in situ light-scattering measurements is presented {{and the results}} are compared with existing measurement techniques. The Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (GRASP) is applied to airborne and laboratory measurements made by a novel polar nephelometer. This instrument, the Polarized Imaging Nephelometer (PI-Neph), is capable of making high-accuracy field measurements of phase function and degree of linear polarization, at three visible wavelengths, over a wide angular range of 3 to 177 °. The resulting retrieval produces particle size distributions (PSDs) that agree, within experimental error, with measurements made by commercial optical particle counters (OPCs). Additionally, the retrieved real part of the refractive index is generally found to be within the predicted error of 0. 02 from the expected values for three species of humidified salt particles, with a refractive index that is well established.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used method for analysis of airborne carbonyls is to collect the analytes on solid sorbents coated with a suitable derivatization agent, followed by solvent desorption and liquid injection for analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography. We have explored a new approach by combining on-sorbent derivatization and thermal desorption to measure airborne carbonyls. More specifically, carbonyls in the air are collected onto an O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine (PFBHA) -coated Tenax sorbent packed in a tube with dimensions identical to those of a gas chromatography (GC) injector liner. The derivatives are then released by in-injection port thermal desorption to a GC column for analysis. Gaseous carbonyls, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal, at ppbv levels are shown to be effectively collected (greater {{than or equal to}} 92 % collection efficiency) onto the sampling tubes at a flow rate of 20 mL/min under both < 1 % and 71 % relative humidity. The collection efficiency drops as the sampling flow rate increases, and the degree of decrease is compound dependent. The derivatization agent, at a level of similar to 127 nmol/tube, is thermally desorbed and eluted from the GC column without compromising the determination of any carbonyl-PFBHA derivatives. Detection limits of low ppbv to sub-ppbv are achieved for a sample air volume of 4. 8 L Using this new method, we have measured formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal to be 4. 9 - 16. 3, 0. 6 - 8. 2, < 5. 9, 0. 5 - 4. 1, and < 2. 4 ppbv, respectively, in the ambient atmosphere at the university bus stop.

40|$|Observations by the EISCAT {{experiments}} “POLAR ” and Common Programme CP- 3 reveal non-Maxwellian ion velocity distributions in the auroral F—region ionosphere. Analysis of {{data from}} three periods is presented. During the first period, convection velocities are large k 2 km S ~) and constant over part of a CP- 3 latitude scan; the second period is one of POLAR data containing a short—lived ( 1. 5 km ~_ 1) flow. We concentrate on these two periods as they allow the study of a great many features of the ion-neutral interactions which drive the plasma non—thermal and provide the best available experimental test for models of the 3 — dimensional ion velocity distribution function. The third period is included to illustrate the fact that non—thermal plasma frequently exists in the auroral ionosphere: the data, also from the <b>POLAR</b> <b>experiment,</b> cover a three—hour period of typical auroral zone flow and analysis reveals that the ion distribution varies from Maxwellian to the threshold of a toroidal form. I NTRODUCTION The existence of non—thermal plasma in the auroral F—region was predicted theoreticaly by It— Maurice and Schunk, in a remarkable series of papers culminating in their 1979 review pape...|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} ellipsoid {{model has}} been established to address the influence of nano-crystallite size on XRD anisotropic peak broadening. The model shows that, for non-spherical nanocrystallite, its XRD peak broadening becomes anisotropic and orientation (hkl) dependent. In such a case, the crystallite size must be described by multi-dimensional lengths, possible with a <b>polar</b> orientation. <b>Experiments</b> on �-Ni(OH) 2, �-TiO 2 and anatase were carried. Results show that the model can explain the characteristics of nano-crystallies with different sizes and shapes. I I...|$|R

The algorithm for calculating these winds was first {{developed for the}} Nimbus- 7 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) in order to investigate scalar winds during the <b>Polar</b> Lows <b>Experiment</b> in February 1984.

40|$|<b>POLAR</b> <b>experiment</b> {{is a novel}} compact space-borne Compton {{polarimeter}} conceived for {{a precise}} measurement of hard X-ray polarization and optimized {{for the detection of}} the prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) in the energy range 50 - 500 keV. The detector consists of an array of 1600 low-Z plastic scintillator bars. The incoming photons undergo Compton scattering in the bars and produce a modulation pattern; simulations and experiments have shown that the polarization degree and angle can be retrieved from this pattern with the accuracy necessary for pinning down the GRB mechanisms. The scintillating bars are divided into the groups of 64 and constitute 25 frontend readout modules. Each module comprises the flat-panel multi-anode photomultiplier, voltage divider circuit, ASIC chip, analog discriminators block and FPGA device. The ASIC chip, manufactured by IDEAS (Norway), performs amplification, shaping and discrimination of 64 signals from one photomultiplier, bringing out the information about number of triggered channels, as well as their position. The analog data can be also sampled by ADC and read out by FPGA. Besides the ASIC trigger signals, frontend module utilizes supplementary set of analog discriminators, that allows to distinguish the level of the energy deposited in the detector. Detection of the polarization signa...|$|R
