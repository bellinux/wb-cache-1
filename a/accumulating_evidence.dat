5|$|One {{particularly}} infamous oceanic whitetip was {{implicated in}} several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2010. This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark {{taken out of}} its upper tail lobe. <b>Accumulating</b> <b>evidence</b> revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it bit the divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions {{in the hope of}} obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place.|$|E

500|$|The social {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem {{wrote in}} Psychological Review that Bell et al. {{provide the most}} important data concerning [...] "experience-based theories" [...] {{of the development of}} sexual orientation, including [...] "the classical psychoanalytic account", as well as views that attribute the origins of sexual orientation to learning, conditioning, seduction, or labeling. According to Bem, their finding that [...] "no family variables" [...] are [...] "strongly implicated in the development of sexual orientation for either men or women" [...] is [...] "consistent with <b>accumulating</b> <b>evidence</b> that family variables account for much less of the environmental variance in personality than previously thought". Bem proposed a hypothesis that he refers to as [...] "Exotic becomes erotic": children feel different from either their same-sex peers or opposite-sex peers and therefore eroticize them, leading to homosexuality and heterosexuality respectively. Bem referred to Bell et al.′s finding that gay men and lesbians {{were significantly more likely to}} recall having felt different from same-sex children during the grade-school years, and to other studies that drew similar conclusions. Bem maintained that Bell′s view that people become erotically attracted to those who are different from them out of a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] does not accurately characterize or explain the data, and rejected Bell et al.′s conclusion that sexual orientation is innate.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, various {{philosophers}} such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor {{tried to}} resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called [...] "folk psychology" [...] while adhering to a materialist {{vision of the world}} which did not violate the [...] "generality of physics". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with <b>accumulating</b> <b>evidence</b> in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Accumulating</b> <b>evidence</b> from {{functional}} neuroimaging studies, {{as well as}} lesion {{studies in}} neurological patients indicates that the right inferior parietal cortex, at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex (TPJ, temporoparietal junction), plays {{a critical role in}} the distinction between self-produced actions and actions perceived in others. Lesions of this region can produce a variety of disorders associated with body knowledge and self-awareness such as anosognosia, asomatognosia, or somatoparaphrenia.

6000|$|There was, of course, {{something}} to be said for the other plan, which was advocated strongly by Sir Charles Warren. The crossing, it was urged, was absolutely safe, being commanded on all sides by our guns, and the enemy could make no opposition except with artillery. Moreover, the army would get on its line of railway and could 'advance along the railroad.' This last was a purely imaginary advantage, to be sure, because the railway had no rolling-stock, and was disconnected from the rest of the line by the destruction of the Tugela bridge. But what weighed with the Commander-in-Chief much more than the representations of his lieutenant was the <b>accumulating</b> <b>evidence</b> that the enemy were in full retreat. The Intelligence reports all pointed to this situation. Boers had ridden off in all directions. Waggons were seen trekking along every road to the north and west.

Retired Colonels for the most part, I daresay, leading parties of aged labourers to the top here, examining clods of earth and stone, and getting into correspondence with the neighbouring clergy, which, being opened at breakfast time, gives them a feeling of importance, and the comparison of arrow-heads necessitates cross-country journeys to the county towns, an agreeable necessity both to them and to their elderly wives, who wish to make plum jam or to clean out the study, and have every reason for keeping that great question of the camp or the tomb in perpetual suspension, while the Colonel himself feels agreeably philosophic in <b>accumulating</b> <b>evidence</b> on both sides of the question.

40|$|Most {{cognitive}} theories {{assume that}} confidence and choice happen simultaneously and {{are based on}} the same information. The 3 studies presented in this article instead show that confidence judgments can arise, at least in part, from a postdecisional evidence accumulation process. As a result of this process, increasing the time between making a choice and confidence judgment improves confidence resolution. This finding contradicts the notion that confidence judgments are biased by decision makers seeking confirmatory evidence. Further analysis reveals that the improved resolution is due to a reduction in confidence in incorrect responses, while confidence in correct responses remains relatively constant. These results are modeled with a sequential sampling process that allows evidence accumulation to continue after a choice is made and maps the amount of <b>accumulated</b> <b>evidence</b> onto a confidence rating. The cognitive modeling analysis reveals that the rate of evidence accumulation following a choice does slow relative to the rate preceding choice. The analysis also shows that the asymmetry between confidence in correct and incorrect choices is compatible with state-dependent decay in the <b>accumulated</b> evidence: <b>Evidence</b> consistent with the current state results in a deceleration of <b>accumulated</b> <b>evidence</b> and consequently evidence appears to have a decreasing impact on observed confidence. In contrast, evidence inconsistent with the current state results in an acceleration of <b>accumulated</b> <b>evidence</b> toward the opposite direction and consequently evidence appears to have an increasing impact on confidence. Taken together, this process-level understanding of confidence suggests a simple strategy for improving confidence accuracy: take a bit more time to make confidence judgments...|$|R

We systematically reviewed all published genetic studies on populations of European ancestry (67 studies on Crohn’s disease [CD] and 37 studies on ulcerative colitis [UC]) to identify critical genomic regions associated with IBD. We developed a computer algorithm to map the 807 P/PI genes with exact genomic locations listed in the MEROPS database of peptidases onto these critical regions and to rank P/PI genes according to the <b>accumulated</b> <b>evidence</b> for their association with CD and UC. 82 P/PI genes (75 coding for proteases and 7 coding for protease inhibitors) were retained for CD based on the <b>accumulated</b> <b>evidence.</b> The cylindromatosis/turban tumor syndrome gene (CYLD) on chromosome 16 ranked highest, followed by acylaminoacyl-peptidase (APEH), dystroglycan (DAG 1), macrophage-stimulating protein (MST 1) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 4 (USP 4), all located on chromosome 3.

This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time.
