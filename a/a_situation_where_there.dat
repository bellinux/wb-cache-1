5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E

2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down.

As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were lucky enough to get everybody off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs."

However, in that same survey, women listed numerous things they feared. A man stated [...] "as a man, I'm afraid of very little."

However the lack of research for <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> one tie-rod experiences different strains than the opposite one leads to failure in the tie-rod assembly and misalignment in the wheels over time. The performance of the steering system would be improved if this information existed. This bachelor’s dissertation looks into this specific <b>situation</b> and conducts <b>an</b> examination on the tie-rods. A simple kinematic model is used {{to determine how the}} steering system moves when there is a steering input. An investigation has been conducted to determine how the system’s geometry affects the strains. The experiment vehicle is a Formula Student car which is designed by the students of Coventry University. The tests performed show the difference in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the two front tyres are on a single surface, two different surfaces – one with high friction, the other with low friction and <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there’s</b> <b>an</b> obstacle in the way of one of the tyres. The experiment results show a major difference in strain in the front tie-rods in the different situations. Interesting conclusions can be made due to the results for the different surface <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> one of the tyres receives similar results in bothcompression and tension, but the other one receives results with great difference. This results given in the report can be a starting ground and help with the improvement in steering systems if more research is conducted...|$|R
