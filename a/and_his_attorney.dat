25|$|While much of {{the debate}} focused on the law's precise language, there was {{considerable}} opposition in the Senate, almost entirely from Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson, the former speaking in defense of free speech and the latter assailing the administration for failing to use the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well. President Wilson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>Attorney</b> General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid hearings that would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from the Justice Department {{and placed it in}} the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality. The final vote for passage was 48 to 26 in the Senate and 293 to 1 in the House of Representatives, with the sole dissenting vote in the House cast by Meyer London of New York.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 2003, it was {{revealed}} that, unknown to Jackson, a third party had secretly wired the private jet chartered to take him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>attorney</b> from Vegas to California with hidden cameras and audio-recording devices, intending to sell video footage of the two to major television and radio networks for {{a large amount of}} money; all networks declined them, however. A restraining order prohibiting the videotape from being shown to any third parties was issued against the jet company. Furthermore, Jackson's party filed a lawsuit against the perpetrators demanding $500,000,000. On November 26, 2003, it was discovered that XtraJet, the company that found the audio recordings and hidden cameras on Jackson's plane, on Monday, showed the video to several news organizations on November 24. Fox News Channel reported that the tape shows Jackson calm and relaxed on the plane. Jackson's legal team (at that point) were awarded $18million in damages in 2008. XtraJet went bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|Largely on {{the basis}} of {{evidence}} obtained through police wiretapping of his telephone, Olmstead was arrested and tried for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act. A Federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Roy Olmstead and 89 other defendants on January 19, 1925, with the trial ending on February 20, 1926, with the conviction of 21 defendants including Roy Olmstead <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>attorney,</b> Jerry Finch. Olmstead was sentenced to four years with hard labor and fined $8,000; Finch receiving a sentence of two years and a fine of $500. Other defendants' sentences ranged from 15 months to three years, with fines; defendants who cooperated and testified for the government, received one-year sentences. He appealed his case, arguing that the incriminating wiretapping evidence, which had been obtained without a warrant, constituted a violation of his constitutional rights to privacy and against self-incrimination. However, in February 1928 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in the landmark case of Olmstead v. United States.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, 2010 in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Papp {{appeared}} before the Hon. Gary L.

Houghton, Papp, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>attorney,</b> William Ward, {{declined to comment on}} terms of the plea agreement, which had been sealed by the court – a measure often taken if a defendant is cooperating with the government in ongoing investigations, but neither Ward nor Houghton would say at the time if that was the case. In October 2011, Papp was finally sentenced to serve a six-month period of house arrest, followed by two and half years probation.|$|E
25|$|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream is a {{novel by}} Hunter S. Thompson, {{illustrated}} by Ralph Steadman. The book is a roman à clef, rooted in autobiographical incidents. The story follows its protagonist, Raoul Duke, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>attorney,</b> Dr. Gonzo, as they descend on Las Vegas to chase the American Dream through a drug-induced haze, all the while ruminating on {{the failure of the}} 1960s countercultural movement. The work is Thompson's most famous book, and is noted for its lurid descriptions of illegal drug use and its early retrospective on the culture of the 1960s. Its popularization of Thompson's highly subjective blend of fact and fiction has become known as gonzo journalism. The novel first appeared as a two-part series in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, and was published as a book in 1972. It was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1998 by Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro who portrayed Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, respectively.|$|E

25|$|In September 2011, Hans Reiser filed a civil lawsuit. In his {{complaint}} {{he named}} more than 70 defendants, including trial judges <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>attorney,</b> William H. Du Bois. He claimed, among other things, that his attorney conspired {{with the judge}} to file motions against him, which were impossible to appeal, and that his attorney had forced {{him to take the}} stand against his will. After several rounds of amendments and additional complaints, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means that Reiser can no longer file civil lawsuits regarding his current convictions. The judges voiced several errors before the dismissal. According to the judges: Reiser's complaint was too long (more than 300 pages in its original form). He had too many defendants, and they included judges, who are immune to lawsuits regarding their official conduct. Finally, the judges could not decide whether there was a cause of action (any illegal deed or event, which could be prosecuted) to accept the plea. Reiser argued that he had not had access to the prison law library and that he had been denied the appointment of an attorney to help him formulate his complaint.|$|E
25|$|In April 1205 the Bishop of Hereford {{was summoned}} {{to appear before the}} court for his refusal to admit a {{suitable}} priest to this church currently in the possession of Cecilia Devereux. In his defense he stated that the clergy of the Hereford Chapter refused to allow an appointment as they claimed possession of this chapel. They requested the right to present their case. On 6 June 1205 Hugh, Dean of Hereford, paid 2 marks for convening another court to hear his suit countering the recognition of Cecilia’s holding of the chapel at Putley. On 29 June 1206, the Bishop of Hereford <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>attorney</b> appeared before the court claiming the church of Putley as their right, and that the grant to Cecilia Devereux had only occurred because the hearing proceeded too quickly to allow them to present their case. When the canons were informed of Cecilia’s claim, they had requested that the sheriff of Hereford put her claim on hold and were told this would require a warrant of the king. The canons submitted an assize presenting their position, and paid 12 shillings for the court to be summoned. On 15 October 1206 the Canons of Hereford appeared to show by what right the claim of Cecilia to the chapel of Putley should be set aside. They argued that they had been in possession of the chapel for over 60 years, and presented the original charter granting them the chapel by William Devereux. They also presented a charter the Bishop of Hereford, which later confirmed the original grant. They argued that the granting of the claim of Cecilia Devereux had occurred too quickly for them to respond, and when they had discovered that it had occurred they began the proceedings to regain their rights. On the payment of 40 shillings, the sheriff was ordered to have a jury assembled on 26 November 1206. The sheriff failed to gather the jury on this day and the hearing was postponed to January 1207. Hugh, Dean of Hereford, put Walter de la Puille in his place for the hearing now occurring on 29 January 1207. On this date the court found in favor of the Canons of Hereford. On 7 October 1207 Cecilia Devereux was fined 3 marks, and she released her claims and those of her future heirs. The canons paid Cecilia 8 marks, and granted her the privilege of having her name celebrated in Hereford Cathedral at the annual thanksgiving to benefactors, and daily in service of the church of Putley.|$|E
