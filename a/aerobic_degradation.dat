Research during the last 15 years, however, has shown that microorganisms have adapted and evolved to utilize hydrocarbon substrates under varying reducing conditions and that they employ novel biochemical processes to activate these compounds in the absence of oxygen.

50|$|Biodrying is {{the process}} by which {{biodegradable}} waste is rapidly heated through initial stages of composting to remove moisture from a waste stream and hence reduce its overall weight. In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the <b>aerobic</b> <b>degradation</b> of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption. It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner. This enables reduced costs of disposal if landfill is charged on a cost per tonne basis. Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for refuse-derived fuels. Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce landfill gas and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils LATS allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.|$|E
50|$|A sample {{dechlorination}} of chlorinated {{aliphatic hydrocarbons}} (CAHs) such as tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene or PCE) by Dehalococcoides ethenogenes has been illustrated above. PCE {{is one of}} the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of <b>aerobic</b> <b>degradation.</b> The high electronegative character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H2 is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids. Moreover, due to competition from methanogens for H2, low H2 concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass. While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions-PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle. Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces PCE into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to vinyl chloride (VC) and ethene are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction. The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms. In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as Desulfomonile, Dehalobacter, Desulfuromonas...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the Dehalococcoides group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from PCE to ethene.|$|E
5000|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} mineralization of recalcitrant {{organic pollutants}} {{is of great}} environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions. In particular, hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable {{in the absence of}} oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating bacteria during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly chlorinated compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of bromine and iodine moieties in aromatic pesticides. [...] Other reactions, such as biologically induced abiotic reduction by soil minerals, has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments. Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the molecular understanding of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of genomics in the field of environmental microbiology, a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic pollutant degradation. The ~4.7 Mb genome of the facultative denitrifying Aromatoleum aromaticum strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using toluene or ethylbenzene as substrates). The genome sequence revealed about two dozen gene clusters (including several paralogs) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>degradation</b> of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and enzyme structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species Geobacter metallireducens (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing Dechloromonas aromatica (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons by halorespiration: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 and Dehalococcoides sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Sedimentation rate {{could become}} a new {{exploration}} tool for evaluating the source rock potential of sedimentary basins in frontier regions. Petroleum source rocks are defined {{on the basis of}} total organic carbon by weight percent. An analysis of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) cores indicates that there exists quantitative relationships between sedimentation rate and total organic carbon content in fine grained ancient marine sediments of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cenezoic age. These relationships are independent of geographic setting, geologic age, and differential compaction, but are highly dependent upon lithology. For any given sedimentation rate, the total organic carbon content increases from calcareous to siliceous to black shale sediments. For each of these lithologies, the total organic carbon content increases with sedimentation rate due to reduced <b>aerobic</b> microbial <b>degradation</b> at higher burial rates. Above a critical sedimentation rate, the total organic carbon content may decrease with increasing sedimentation rate due to a clastic dilution effect. <b>Aerobic</b> microbial <b>degradation,</b> however, continues to be less efficient at higher burial rates. Therefore, even though the total organic carbon content may decrease, the quality of the organic matter preserved and the oil generation and oil migration potential of the sediment may continue to increase with increasing sedimentation rate. Similar relationships have also been established between total organic carbon and grain accumulation rate, and total organic carbon accumulation rate and grain accumulation rate. These relationships support both reduced <b>aerobic</b> microbial <b>degradation</b> and the clastic dilution effect. In the latter case, the lithologic control is less pronounced, and the relationship can be used to determine total organic carbon content even when the lithology is not known. The results of this study have important implications for petroleum exploration in frontier regions. Sedimentation rate and grain accumulation rate could be determined from seismic isopach and velocity data. When the lithology is not known, such as prior to exploration drilling, grain accumulation rates could be used to estimate the total organic carbon content, and the oil generation and oil migration potential of a sedimentary basin. Once the lithology is known, the source rock potential of the basin can be more accurately predicted. Future work should be directed toward testing the application of sedimentation rate and grain accumulation rate in the petroleum exploration of frontier regions...|$|R

PCB biodegradation by indigenous microbial communities {{could be a}} cost-effective and an environmental-friendly bioremediation strategy for in situ PCB removal. A comprehensive understanding of the microbial PCB degradation at the contaminated site {{is required for the}} acceptance and optimization of using microbial PCB degradation as the site clean-up strategy. This thesis describes investigations of the aerobic and anaerobic microbial degradation of PCBs under both field and laboratory conditions. The microbial PCB degradation potential in sediments from Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal (IHSC), a site that was historically contaminated by PCBs, was explored by analyzing the PCB congener distributions and microbial communities in two core sediment samples. PCB congener analysis suggested the possibility of in situ dechlorination in deep sediments. Molecular analysis of biomarker genes revealed the potential of both aerobic and anaerobic PCB degradation in sediments. Microbial communities were characterized by the combination use of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), clone library, and pyrosequencing. These methods elucidated the dominant role of Proteobacteria, especially Acidovorax and Acinetobacter in sediments. To improve the microbial PCB degradation, phytoremediation with switchgrass (Panicum vigratum) was employed under laboratory conditions. Congener analysis showed that both phytoextraction and microbial PCB degradation contributed to the enhanced PCB removal in the presence of switchgrass. Bioaugmentation with Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 was performed to further promote <b>aerobic</b> PCB <b>degradation.</b> The presence of LB 400 was associated with improved degradation of PCB 52, but not PCB 77 or PCB 153. Increased abundance of the biphenyl dioxygenase gene, which is indicative of <b>aerobic</b> PCB <b>degradation,</b> and its transcript were observed after bioaugmentation, suggesting active <b>aerobic</b> PCB <b>degradation.</b> To promote the anaerobic PCB degradation, redox cycling (alternating flooding and non-flooding) was performed.

No degradation was observed during exposure of S-cysts to anoxic water masses. Analysis of two short cores from the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean permitted calculation of the degradation constant (k) for S-cysts (Brigantedinium spp. and Selenophemphix antarctica). Calculated k decreases exponentially with increasing oxygen exposure time (OET), supporting earlier findings that OM degradation depends on labile organic component concentrations. Constant k also shows a positive correlation with pore-water O 2 concentrations, implying that degradation is dependent not only on OET and OM concentration, but also on O 2 concentrations in bottom and pore waters. O 2 seems to be a limiting factor at lower concentrations, whereas at higher O 2 concentrations the availability of labile OM seems to be more important. A study of the Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation provided information on the selective degradation of extinct dinocyst species. This is the first attempt to investigate <b>aerobic</b> <b>degradation</b> of in situ Jurassic dinocysts. Several taxa (i. e.

Species-selective degradation is shown to be a rapid process and therefore cannot be neglected on any time scale.

The contributions of catalytic and substrate binding residues, thus, identified were examined through steady-state kinetic analysis of site-directed mutant proteins. Aromatic compounds serve as a rich source of carbon and energ...|$|R
50|$|Bioslurping {{combines}} {{elements of}} bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water (light non-aqueous phase liquid or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a “slurp” tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw {{in a glass}} draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, {{off the top of}} the water table and from the capillary fringe (i.e., an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term “bioslurping” refer to <b>aerobic</b> biological <b>degradation</b> of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone.|$|R
40|$|Sedimentation rate {{could become}} a new {{exploration}} tool for evaluat-ing the source rock potential of sedimentary basins in frontier regions. Petroleum source rocks are defined {{on the basis of}} total organic carbon by weight percent. An analysis of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) cores indicates that there exists quantitative relationships between sedimentation rate and total organic carbon content in fine grained ancient marine sediments of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cenezoic age. These relationships are independent of geographic setting, geologic age, and differential compaction, but are highly dependent upon lithology. For any given sedimentation rate, the total organic carbon content increases from calcareous to siliceous to black shale sediments. For each of these lithologies, the total organic carbon content increases with sedimentation rate due to reduced <b>aerobic</b> microbial <b>degradation</b> at higher burial rates. Above a critical sedimentation rate, the total organic carbon content may decrease with increasing sedimentation rat...|$|R
