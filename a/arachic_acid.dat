40|$|In part I of {{this article}} the thermotropic mesophases of {{anhydrous}} ionic amphiphiles were discussed. In this part the thermotropic mesophases of ionic amphiphiles in aqueous media, as determined by thermal analysis, microscopic studies, X-ray diffraction and other techniques are reviewed. The fatty acids saturated or unsaturated that {{are found in the}} above molecules are: Lauric acid (C 12 H 24 O 2); myristic acid (C 14 H 28 O 2); palmitic acid (C 16 H 32 O 2); stearic acid (C 18 H 36 O 2); <b>arachic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 20 H 40 O 2); behenic acid (C 22 H 44 O 2); oleic acid (C 18 H 34 O 2). © 1994 Akadémiai Kiadó...|$|E
40|$|The {{composite}} {{assembly of}} C 60 and CdS Quantum Dots (QDs) on ITO substrate was prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique using <b>arachic</b> <b>acid</b> (AA), stearic acid (SA) and octadecanyl amine (OA) as additives. Photoassisted conductive {{atomic force microscopy}} was used to make point contact current-voltage (I-V) measurements on both the CdS QDs and the composite assembly of C 60 /CdS. The result {{make it clear that}} the CdS, C 60 /CdS assemblies deposited on ITO substrate showed linear characteristics and the current increased largely under illumination comparing with that in the dark. The coherent, nonresonant tunneling mechanism was used to explain the current occurrence. It is considered that the photoinduced carriers CdS QDs tunneled through alkyl chains increased the current rapidly...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{elucidate}} molecular {{interactions of}} enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) with unsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, octadecatrienoic acid, stearic acid and <b>arachic</b> <b>acid</b> {{to investigate the}} inhibitory activities of degree of unsaturation. Methods: Docking between these ligands and enzymes were performed using Autodock 4. 2. Results: Docosahexaenoic acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid) is more efficient inhibitor of enoylacyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) compared to other unsaturated fatty acids with lesser double bonds and saturated fatty acid with reference to ∆G and Ki values. Hydrophobic interactions {{play an important role}} in the correct positioning of these fatty acids within the catalytic site of FabI enzyme to permit docking. Conclusions: It has been also observed that not only the degree of unsaturation affects the antiplasmodial activity, but the length of carbon chain also plays an important role in their inhibitory activity. Such information may aid in the design of versatile FabI-inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Compositions of fatty acid, amino acids, and {{volatile}} compound were investigated in green coffee beans of seven cultivars of Coffea robusta grown in Hainan Province, China. The chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, caffeine, total lipid, and total protein contents {{as well as}} color parameters were measured. Chemometric techniques, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and analysis of one-way variance (ANOVA) were performed on the complete data set to reveal chemical differences among all cultivars and identify markers characteristic of a particular botanical origin of the coffee. The major fatty acids of coffee were linoleic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and <b>arachic</b> <b>acid.</b> Leucine (0. 84 g/ 100 g DW), lysine (0. 63 g/ 100 g DW), and arginine (0. 61 g/ 100 g DW) were the predominant essential amino acids (EAAs) in the coffee samples. Seventy-nine volatile compounds were identified and semi-quantified by HS-SPME/GC-MS. PCA of the complete data matrix demonstrated that {{there were significant differences}} among all cultivars, HCA supported the results of PCA and achieved a satisfactory classification performance...|$|E
