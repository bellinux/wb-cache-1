50|$|On 9 September 2015, Bial {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the Helsinn Group for the exclusive distribution and license rights to the Helsinn Group's drug <b>anamorelin</b> in Spain, Portugal, Angola and Mozambique. In 2015, Bial commissioned a contract research organization Biotrial to run a phase one clinical trial for BIA 10-2474, an FAAH inhibitor that targets the endocannabinoid system. The research in Rennes commenced in July 2015, evaluating male and female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years old receiving a single dose. On 7 January 2016, a trial involving multiple doses was started on six non-placebo subjects. The first patient receiving the multiple doses was hospitalized at Rennes University Hospital on 10 January, leading Biotrial to suspend the study on 11 January. Five patients were hospitalized, with the first one receiving the multiple dose becoming brain dead.|$|E

It is associated with profoundly deleterious effects on {{quality of life and}} survival. Since its discovery over a decade ago, <b>anamorelin</b> hydrochloride (<b>anamorelin),</b> a mimetic of the growth hormone secretagogue ghrelin, has shown considerable promise in ameliorating components of CACS when administered to patients with advanced cancer, including loss of lean body mass and reversal of anorexia. This review summarizes the development of <b>anamorelin</b> and its safety and efficacy in clinical investigations. The potential future role of <b>anamorelin</b> in treating CACS is also discussed.

40|$|Novel {{mechanism}} of ghrelin therapy for cachexia I read {{with great interest}} the recent article by Ji-an Chen et al. 1 Calorie intake {{is a major factor}} for the body compo-sition including muscle mass. 2 So, increase of food intake by the ghrelin administration in vivo {{could be one of the}} mechanisms for improvement of muscle wasting. In addi-tion to that, this article showed the novel mechanism, which suggested that ghrelin administration could improve the muscle wasting induced by cisplatin in the skeletal muscle locally. <b>Anamorelin</b> HCl is a novel, orally active, ghrelin receptor ago-nist in clinical development for the treatment of cancer cachexia. 3 <b>Anamorelin</b> enhanced body weight, tended to im-prove handgrip strength, increased appetite and quality of life, and decreased inflammatory markers from a phase 2 study. 4, 5 As patients were permitted to receive chemotherapy while on the study, therapeutic effect of <b>anamorelin</b> could be resulted from the effects on the tumor-induced and chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting. Judging from the aspect, the article suggests a novel mechanism that supports the clinical test partially. Another clinical trial suggested that the adverse effects of cachexia induced by cancer and chemotherapy cannot be recovered by additional nutrition alone. 6 The trial supports the hypothesis that the appetite regulation would not be enough for cachexia therapy. On the other hand, ghrelin is known to have multi-actions, including not only increase in food intake but also decrease in energy expenditure and inflammation, increase in growth hormone and direct anabolic effect in skeletal muscles and adipose tissue. 1, 7 – 10 In addition to the increased appetite, some of these effects were confirmed in <b>anamorelin</b> trial. 4, 5 In order to make a better understanding of cachexia pathophysiology and therapeutic options for cachexia, it is important to under-stand the therapeutic {{mechanism of}} ghrelin and <b>anamorelin</b> in detail. For instance, it remains unclear whether ghrelin and <b>anamorelin</b> directly affected on the muscle cell in vivo and which action of ghrelin and <b>anamorelin</b> is the most im-portant for the treatment of cachexia. Further advances are urgently needed. Acknowledgements The authors certify that they comply with the ethical guide-lines for authorship and publishing of the Journal of Cachexia...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of age and gender on the {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of the ghrelin receptor agonist <b>anamorelin.</b> Methods: Three demographic cohorts of healthy subjects were enrolled in this single-center, open-label study. Subjects received a single oral dose (25 mg) of <b>anamorelin</b> HCl. Serial blood samples were collected over 24 hours to assess <b>anamorelin</b> PK and circulating growth hormone (GH) levels. Data were compared with a reference cohort. Results: <b>Anamorelin</b> was rapidly absorbed in all cohorts; peak concentrations were observed 30 – 45 minutes and 2 – 4 hours post-dose, which declined biexponentially with mean terminal half-lives of 6 – 7 hours. An age effect on Cmax and AUC 1 was not apparent; however, mean AUC 1 values were approximately 1. 8 – 1. 9 -fold higher in the female cohorts than in the referencemale cohort. GH increase was rapid and virtually identical in both sexes, though attenuated in elderly subjects. No clinically significant safety or tolerability findings were observed. Conclusions:While PK parameters do suggest higher exposure in females, this effect {{is considered to be}} modest given the variability of the 6 – 8 subjects per cohort. Moreover, no such effect was observed in the pharmacodynamic responses, thus, dose adjustment for age and gender is considered unnecessary. Keyword...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{highlights}} preclinical {{and clinical}} stud-ies {{in the field}} of wasting disorders that were presented at the 7 th Cachexia Conference held in Kobe, Japan, in December 2013. This year, the main topics were the development of new methods and new biomarkers {{in the field of}} cachexia and wasting disorders with particular focus on inflammatory path-ways, growth differentiation factor- 15, myostatin, the ubiqui-tin proteasome-dependent pathway, valosin and the regulation of ubiquitin-specific protease 19 that is involved in the differ-entiation of myogenin and myosin heavy chain. This article presents highlights from the development of drugs that have shown potential in the treatment of wasting disorders, partic-ularly the ghrelin receptor agonist <b>anamorelin,</b> the myostatin antagonist REGN 1033, the selective androgen receptor mod-ulators enobosarm and TEI-E 0001, and the anabolic catabolic transforming agent espindolol.

40|$|Sarcopenia and {{cachexia}} {{are significant}} medical {{problems with a}} high disease related burden in cardiovascular illness. Muscle wasting and weight loss are very frequent particularly in chronic heart failure and they relate to poor prognosis. Although clinically largely underestimated, the fields of cachexia and sarcopenia are of great relevance to cardiologists. In cachexia and sarcopenia {{a significant number of}} research publications related to basic science questions of muscle wasting and lipolysis were published between 2010 and 2012. Recently, the two processes of muscle wasting and lipolysis were found to be closely linked. Treatment research in pre-clinical models involves studies on a number of different therapeutic entities, including ghrelin, selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), as well as drugs targeting myostatin or melanocortin- 4. In the human setting, studies using enobosarm (a SARM) and <b>anamorelin</b> (ghrelin) are in phase III. The last 3 years has seen significant efforts to define the field using consensus statements. In the future, these definitions should also be considered for guidelines and treatment trials in cardiovascular medicine. The current review aims to summarize important information and development in the fields of muscle wasting, sarcopenia and cachexia focussing on findings in cardiovascular research, in order for cardiologists to {{have a better understanding of}} the progress in the still not well enough known field...|$|E
