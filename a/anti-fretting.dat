40|$|Thermoelastic stress {{analysis}} (TSA) {{has been applied}} to measure the first stress invariant on a composite helicopter component under load. The component comprised inner mono-directional glass fiber layers with an outer central plate in glass fiber cloth, covered by an <b>anti-fretting</b> surface coating. In order to obtain quantitative results, a previous calibration of the thermoelastic constant obtained on a composite sample with a similar <b>anti-fretting</b> coating has been necessary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{deals with}} {{fretting}} wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel on a SRVoscillating friction and wear tester. The {{results indicate that}} with the frequency and load increasing, both the friction coefficient and fretting wear volume increase. With the amplitude increasing, the fretting wear volume increased too, but the effect of amplitude on friction coefficient was not simple positive correlation according to the experimental results. Meanwhile, the fretting wear mechanism {{is directly related to}} test frequency, load and amplitude. When they are small, the main fretting wear mechanism is abrasive wear, with these test parameters increasing, the main fretting wear mechanism turns to a combination of abrasive wear and adhesion wear. Based on the experimental results, the <b>anti-fretting</b> wear measures of steel worm gear pairs used in mechanical tracked regulator of tracked vehicle are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Double-glow plasma {{coatings}} {{are recommended}} for metallic components {{to mitigate the}} damage induced by complex loading conditions. In this paper, Cr–Nb alloyed layer was formed onto the TiAl substrate via a double-glow plasma process to enhance its <b>anti-fretting</b> wear performance. Nano-indentation and scratch tests were {{used to evaluate the}} mechanical properties of the coating. The fretting wear behaviour of the coating was investigated using a pin-on-plate fretting rig by rubbing against the Si 3 N 4 ball. The 7 [*]µm thick Cr–Nb coating was well bonded to the substrate with the 2 [*]µm thick diffusion layer. The hardness of the coating was 9. 5 [*]GPa, which was 1. 6 times greater than that of the uncoated TiAl substrate. Scratch tests showed that the critical load of Cr–Nb coating was 17. 6 [*]N. The fretting wear mechanism of the coatings was discussed in detail in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Under {{simulated}} human physiological solution, the fretting {{behaviors of}} flat cortical bone specimen from fresh human femur in the transverse orientation were investigated by sliding against pure titanium ball counterpart (tangential fretting technique). The friction coefficients and logs were calculated automatically. The worn {{surfaces of the}} cortical bone were analyzed by means of laser confocal scanning microscopy. The {{results show that the}} fricion coefficient of cortical bone directly relate with the magnitudes of displacement. The friction logs for cortical bone change with the magnitudes of displacement (Fn= 90 N) from elastic partial slip (D≤ 5 µm), plastoelastic partial slip (D= 10 µm) to slip (D ≥ 20 µm) respectively. The fretting damages of cortical bone in the elastic partial slip were slight. But ploughs and delaminations were observed in the plastoelastic partial slip and gross sliding with loss of contact stiffness of cortical bone. The wear depth increased with cycles and well related to the friction coefficient of cortical bone in each fretting regime. Controlling the displacement amplitude and friction coefficients of bone-implant interface, it might be helpful to increase the <b>anti-fretting</b> capacities of human cortical bone...|$|E
