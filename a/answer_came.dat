The <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> from a musket shot targeted at the trumpeter who {{was shot in the}} head and killed instantly. Maurice enraged at this violation of the laws of war dug his line of trenches further towards the town. Next day the garrison numbering six hundred capitulated and gave up the musketeer who had murdered the trumpeter.|$|E
25|$|With {{a stable}} peace {{agreement}} with the Byzantines in the west, Khosrow was now able to focus his attention on the eastern Hephthalites and end their domination over Central Asia. Even {{with the growth of}} Persian military power under Khosrow's reforms, the Sasanians were still uneasy at the prospect of attacking the Hephthalite on their own and began to seek allies. Their <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> in the form of Turkic incursions into Central Asia. The movement of Turkic people into Central Asia very quickly made them natural enemies and competitors to the Hephthalites.|$|E

500|$|The bishop {{tried to}} persuade him to become a monk, but Dunstan was {{doubtful}} whether he had a vocation to a celibate life. The <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> {{in the form of an}} attack of swelling tumours all over Dunstan's body. This ailment was so severe that it was thought to be leprosy. It was more probably some form of blood poisoning caused by being beaten and thrown in the cesspool. Whatever the cause, it changed Dunstan's mind. He took Holy Orders in 943, in the presence of Ælfheah, and returned to live the life of a hermit at Glastonbury. Against the old church of St Mary he built a small cell five feet long and two and a half feet deep. [...] It was there that Dunstan studied, worked at his handicrafts, and played on his harp. It is at this time, according to a late 11th-century legend, that the Devil is said to have tempted Dunstan and to have been held by the face with Dunstan's tongs.|$|E

[...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? [...] The <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> in December, when the bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. [...] Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.|$|E

[...] Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall [...] "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in". [...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. [...] Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say [...] "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} Prohibition, Dutch Schultz {{needed to}} find new sources of income. His <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> with Otto [...] "Abbadabba" [...] Berman and the Harlem numbers racket. The numbers racket, the forerunner of [...] "Pick 3" [...] lotteries, {{required}} players to choose three numbers, which were then derived from the last number before the decimal in the handle at the racetrack. [...] Berman was a middle-aged accountant and math whiz who let Schultz fix this racket. In a matter of seconds, Berman could mentally calculate the minimum amount of money Schultz needed to bet at the track {{at the last minute}} in order to alter the odds. This strategy ensured that Schultz always controlled which numbers won, guaranteeing a larger number of losers in Harlem and a multimillion-dollar-a-month tax-free income for Schultz. Berman was reportedly paid $10,000 a week for his valued insight.|$|E
2500|$|Following this conference, he sailed for Italy, {{anchoring}} in Livorno on 19 November.

Dilkes claimed {{the right to be}} saluted first by the castle, but the <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> that this honour was only offered to admirals or vice-admirals. Rear-admiral Dilkes had to be content with this answer, and as a conciliatory gesture he was invited to a public dinner on shore on 1 December. Returning to his flagship after this meal he caught a chill, followed by a fever, from which he died on 12 December 1707. His death coming so soon after his dispute with the grand-ducal court led to rumours that he had been poisoned; John Campbell, for example, writing that his fever was [...] "caused, as most people imagined, by an Italian dinner."

2500|$|The {{turning point}} came for Namibia on 21 June 1971 when the World Court {{delivered}} its judgment that South Africa's occupation of Namibia was illegal.

The letters came as something of a shock for the South African government for they accused the government of human rights abuses in its occupation of Namibia. Until then the Lutherans had been regarded as [...] "good" [...] by the South African government and not given to criticising government policies such as the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi's {{links to}} Islamic {{fundamentalist}} groups, {{as well as}} allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting Osama bin Laden to the country. The United States had listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993, mostly due to al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi taking complete power in the early 1990s. U.S. firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997. In 1998, the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum was destroyed by a U.S. cruise missile strike because of its alleged production of chemical weapons and links to al-Qaeda. However the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning {{the attack on the}} factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in the New York Times: [...] "Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The <b>answer</b> <b>came</b> back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak." ...|$|E

[...] The Head of Christ is venerated in the Coptic Orthodox Church, after twelve-year-old Isaac Ayoub, who diagnosed with cancer, saw the eyes of Jesus in the painting shedding tears; Fr.

With episcopal approval from Bishop Tadros of Port Said and Bishop Yuhanna of Cairo, [...] "Sallman's Head of Christ was exhibited in the Coptic Church", with [...] "more than fifty thousand people" [...] visiting the church to see it. In addition, several religious magazines have explained the [...] "power of Sallman's picture" [...] by documenting occurrences such as headhunters letting go of a businessman and fleeing after seeing the image, a [...] "thief who aborted his misdeed when he saw the Head of Christ on a living room wall", and deathbed conversions of non-believers to Christianity.
