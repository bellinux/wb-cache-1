40|$|Vancomycin-resistant enterococcci (VRE) in Europe {{are thought}} to have emerged partly due {{to the use of the}} {{glycopeptide}} <b>avoparcin</b> in animal husbandry.

We also studied the relatedness between VRE strains from different regions and habitats. In total, 2, 580 samples were collected from humans, animals, and the environment (soil, sewage, recipient water). VRE resistant to 20 μg/ml vancomycin were identified in 8. 2 % of the samples and were found most frequently in raw and treated urban sewage samples (means, 71 % and 36 % of the samples, respectively), pig manure (17 %), and hospital sewage (16 %). The proportions of VRE-positive sewage samples were similar in Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom, whereas pig feces and manure were more often positive in Spain than in Sweden (30 % versus 1 %). Most VRE were Enterococcus faecium carrying vanA, and computerized biochemical phenotyping of the isolates of different ecological origins showed a high degree of polyclonality. In conclusion, it seems that animal-associated VRE probably reflect the former use of <b>avoparcin</b> in animal production, whereas VRE in human-associated samples may be a result of antibiotic use in hospitals.

With all other antimicrobials except <b>avoparcin</b> and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in MIC increases of 1 to 3 log 2 differences.

Of these VRE isolates, 73 (89 %) were VanA-type Enterococcus faecalis and nine (11 %) were VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. All E. faecalis isolates were found to have an identical or closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of SmaI-digested DNA and were susceptible to both ampicillin and gentamicin. The PFGE patterns of the nine E. faecium isolates were heterogeneous. All VRE contained both the vanA and ermB genes, which, regardless of species or PFGE pattern, resided on the same plasmid. Eighty-seven percent of the VRE isolates also harbored the tet(M) gene, while for 63 and 100 %, respectively, of these isolates, the avilamycin and bacitracin MICs were high (≥ 256 μg/ml).

Fecal samples from poultry farmers and their flocks on 29 previously avoparcin-exposed farms were collected on five occasions during the study period (1998 to 2003). All flocks (100 %) were GRE positive in 1998. Throughout the study period, 78. 5 % of the poultry samples were GRE positive. Glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium (GREF) was isolated from 27. 6 % of the farmer samples in 1998 and from 27. 8 % of the samples collected between 1998 and 2003. The prevalence of fecal GRE in poultry declined significantly during the study period, but prevalence in samples from the farmers did not decline. PCR analysis revealed a specific Tn 1546 -plasmid junction fragment in 93. 9 % of E. faecium isolates. A putative postsegregation killing (PSK) system linked to Tn 1546 was detected in 97. 1 % of the isolates examined. Multilocus sequence typing of glycopeptide-susceptible (n = 10) and -resistant (n = 10) E. faecium isolates from humans (n = 10) and poultry (n = 10) on two farms displayed 17 different sequence types. The study confirms the continuing persistence of a widespread common plasmid-mediated vanA-pRE 25 -PSK element within a heterogeneous GRE population on Norwegian poultry farms 8 years after the <b>avoparcin</b> ban. Moreover, it suggests an important role of PSK systems in the maintenance of antimicrobial resistance determinants in reservoirs without apparent antimicrobial selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and diversity}} of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) were investigated in 100 Danish broiler flocks 15 years after the <b>avoparcin</b> ban. VREF occurred in 47 flocks at low fecal concentrations detectable only by selective en-richment. Vancomycin resistance was prevalently associated with a transferable nontypeable plasmid lineage occurring in multi-ple E. faecium clones. Coselection of sequence type 842 by tetracycline use only partly explained the persistence of vancomycin resistance {{in the absence of}} detectable plasmid coresistance and toxin-antitoxin systems. The public health impact of the transfer of vanA plasmids fromanimal to human enterococci is unclear (1, 2, 3). As a result of the ban {{on the use of the}} vancomycin analogue <b>avoparcin</b> as a growth promoter in livestock in Denmark in 1995, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in Danish broilers gradually decreased from 80 % in 1995 (4) to undetectable levels in 2010 (5). However, these data were generated by testing one random E. faecium isolate per flock (5), which is not optimal for detecting antimicrobial resistance occurring in fecal samples at low bacterial concentrations (6, 7). The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence {{and diversity of}} VREF in Danish broilers 15 years after the <b>avoparcin</b> ban using selective and non-selective isolation methods. Cloacal swabs were collected at slaughter from 500 broilers between April and September 2010 within a stratified random-sampling scheme representative of the Danish broiler popula-tion (5). These samples represented 100 broiler flocks from farms geographically distributed across the regions where most Danish broiler holdings are located and accounted for approx-imately 25 % of the broiler samples collected for the Danis...|$|E
40|$|The view on enterococci {{has over}} the years shifted from {{harmless}} commensals to opportunistic but important pathogens mainly causing nosocomial infections. One {{important part of this}} development is the emergence of vancomycin resistance enterococci (VRE). The term VRE includes several combinations of bacterial species and resistance genes of which the most clinically important is Enterococcus faecium with vanA type vancomycin resistance. This variant is also the most common VRE among farm animals. The reason for VRE being present among farm animals is selection by extensive use of the vancomycin analog <b>avoparcin</b> for growth promotion. Once the use of <b>avoparcin</b> was discontinued, the prevalence of VRE among farm animals decreased. However, VRE are still present among farm animals and by spread via food products they could potentially {{have a negative impact on}} public health. This review is based on the PhD thesis Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci in Swedish Broilers &#x 2013; Emergence, Epidemiology and Elimination and makes a short summary of VRE in humans and food producing animals. The specific situation regarding VRE in Swedish broiler production is also mentioned...|$|E
40|$|Five Norwegian broiler farms {{previously}} {{identified as}} housing broilers carrying vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were examined {{for the presence}} of VRE 4 years after <b>avoparcin</b> was banned. Environmental samples were obtained from empty, cleaned broiler houses. Faecal samples were collected weekly from the flock housed after the environmental sampling. The hatchery from where the chicks originated was also sampled. VRE were found to be present in the farm environment after depopulation and cleanup of the broiler houses...|$|E

40|$|A {{microbiological}} {{screening method}} (three-plate) {{for the detection}} of the antimicrobial growth promoters tylosin, spiramycin, virginiamycin, zinc bacitracin, and <b>avoparcin</b> in animal feed has been developed and validated successfully. A collaborative study involving 18 laboratories receiving 172 samples was carried out to verify the performance characteristics. The detection level for tylosin/virginiamycin/spiramycin, expressed in microbiological activity, was 1 mg kg- 1 (false-positives, 2 %; false-negatives, 3, 0, and 6 %, respectively). <b>Avoparcin</b> could be detected at 1 mg kg- 1 in feed in general (false-positives, 2 %; false-negatives, 0 %). However, in calf feed the sensitivity was lower. The percentages of false-negatives were found to be 12 %, 7 %, and 0 % at 1, 3, and 5 mg kg- 1, respectively (false-positives, 4 %). The limit of detection for zinc bacitracin was 3 - 5 mg kg- 1 (false-positives, 5 - 10 %; false-negatives, 77 % at 1 mg kg- 1, 45 % at 2 mg kg- 1, 12 % at 3 mg kg- 1, and 4 % at 5 mg kg- 1). The method allowed for a distinction to be made between the groups of antibiotics: avoparcin/zinc bacitracin versus tylosin/virginiamycin/spiramycin. This definitely gives added value to the method in the framework of a follow-up of positive screening results by post-screening and confirmatory analysis...|$|E
40|$|Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) {{in healthy}} people and in food-producing animals {{seems to be}} quite common in Europe. The {{existence}} of this community reservoir of VRE {{has been associated with}} the massive use of <b>avoparcin</b> in animal husbandry. Eight years after the <b>avoparcin</b> ban in Europe, we investigated the incidence of VanA enterococci, their resistance patterns, and the mobility of their glycopeptide-resistance determinants in a sampling of animal rectal swabs and clinical specimens. A total of 259 enterococci isolated from equine, swine, and clinical samples were subcultured on KF-streptococcus agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) supplemented with vancomycin and teicoplanin; 7 (6. 7 %), 10 (16 %), and 8 (8. 6 %) respectively were found to be glycopeptides resistant (VanA phenotype). Slight differences in antimicrobial resistance patterns resulted among VRE recovered from the different sources. Polymerase chain reaction amplification demonstrated the presence of the vanA gene cluster and its extrachromosomal location in VRE plasmid DNA. VanA resistance was transferred in 7 out of 25 mating experiments, 4 with clinical, 2 with swine, and only 1 with equine donors. The conjugative plasmids of animal strains showed a high homology in the restriction profiles, unlike plasmids of clinical microrganisms. Our observations confirmed the possible horizontal transfer of VanA plasmids across different strains and, consequently, the diffusion of the vancomycin-resistance determinants...|$|E
