5|$|As Ottoman {{rule in the}} Balkans expanded, Albanian timar holders and {{officials}} were once again replaced with Anatolian ones. The status quo ante bellum policies of the Ottomans gradually {{led to the formation}} of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444 and the beginning of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> the Ottoman-Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{declined}} in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy. The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were {{generated by the}} Cold War ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> American Civil liberties. In 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.|$|E
5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit {{became part of the}} giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies to show off their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|After {{the revolt}} had largely been suppressed, those who {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed {{to retain their}} holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Teodor Korona Muzaka in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead {{in part to the}} formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> the Ottoman–Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for {{yet another}} {{prisoner}} exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due {{to the influence of}} the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> the country's history.|$|E
5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, can {{be taken}} by sending {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated {{a new way to}} probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> Chola–Chalukya relations. SaktivarmanI, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though {{under the control of}} king Rajaraja CholaI. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{assembly}} {{marked the}} beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> space architecture). First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and Skylab had monolithic designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability; the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress. The capability of Mir to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind (for instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the 1960s, digital {{computer}} games were created by increasingly numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry with the display of the coin-operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first widely available arcade game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video game consoles.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{appointment}} of Irving Thalberg as general manager at Universal, Stroheim's defiance of commercial and industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg's prior shutdown of Foolish Wives in 1921 (which shot nonstop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on Merry-Go-Round, Stroheim was finally fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This was a step unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors. However, by this time Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the Goldwyn Company on September 14, 1922, {{less than a month}} before, and he formally signed with them in late November.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France {{was viewed}} as the {{potential}} start of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>in</b> Australian winter sports, with hopes that a maiden medal would result. Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but crashed in the semi-finals. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing and knocked over teammate John Kah during a changeover; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final. In the individual speed skating events, Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts, with none higher than 12th, and only one placing in the top half. Kirstie Marshall {{was in the process}} of winning the 1992 World Cup series, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, which was a demonstration event, but she crash-landed and finished seventh. Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events, and finished in the top half of the competitors in four events; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events. Despite the disappointments of the near-misses, Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics, purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993.|$|E
