40|$|Spin-wave {{resonance}} (SWR) is a newly emerged {{method for}} studying surface magnetic anisotropy and surface spin-wave modes (SSWMs) in (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> films. The existence of SSWMs in (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> films {{has recently been}} reported in the literature; SSWMs have been observed in the in-plane configuration (with variable azimuth angle ϕ_M between the in-plane magnetization of the film and the surface [100] crystal axis), in the azimuth angle range between two in-plane critical angles ϕ_c 1 and ϕ_c 2. We show here that cubic surface anisotropy is an essential factor determining the existence conditions of the above-mentioned SSWMs: conditions favorable for the occurrence of surface spin-wave modes in <b>a</b> (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> film in the in-plane configuration are fulfilled for those azimuth orientations of the magnetization of the sample that lie around the hard axes of cubic magnetic anisotropy. This implies that a hard cubic anisotropy axis can be regarded in (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> films as <b>an</b> easy axis for surface spin pinning...|$|R
