5000|$|Techne {{is often}} used as a term to further define the process of rhetoric as <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion.</b> In his writing Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric, rhetoric scholar Dr. John Poulakos {{explains}} how the Sophists believed rhetoric to be an art that aimed for terpis, or aesthetic pleasure, while maintaining a medium of logos. For centuries, debate between sophists and followers of Plato has ensued over whether rhetoric {{can be considered a}} form of art based on the different definitions of techne. [...] Contrasting from others, Isocrates saw rhetoric as an art—yet {{in the form of a}} set of rules, or a handbook. Some examples of handbooks are the Rhetoric of Aristotle, the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum, and the De Inventione of Cicero, all composed of rules to write effective speeches. [...] On the other hand, it can be seen in David Roochnik’s book Of Art and Wisdom: Plato’s Understanding of Techne that Plato viewed techne as “a stable body of reliable knowledge able to tell us, in fixed terms readily teachable to others, how we ought to live.” He believed that moral knowledge is equivalent to a techne and that the meaning of the term techne must be fully grasped to understand the nature of moral knowledge.|$|E

40|$|In {{a famous}} passage of his Rhetoric (I, 9, 1368 a), Aristotle {{presents}} the historical example {{as an appropriate}} argument for deliberation: “Examples are most suitable to deliberative speeches; for we judge of future events by divination from past events”. The relevancy of the historical example for civic deliberation {{is based on the}} idea, often stated in Aristotle’s Treaties that, most the time, the future resembles the past (II, 21, 1394 a; III, 16, 1417 b). By establishing an analogy between a past situation and a situation under discussion in the present, deliberating citizens can hope to identify the right course of action. But the idea that history can provide examples helping to remove uncertainty from civic deliberations does not fit well with the very definition of the scope of deliberation. Indeed, to quote Aristotle again, “The subjects of our deliberation are such as seem to present us with alternative possibilities: about things that could not have been, and cannot now or in the future be, other than they are, nobody who takes them to be of this nature wastes his time in deliberation”. It therefore invites us to consider the idea that “often, the future resembles the past” not as a law of history but as the description of a commonplace (in the technical sense of the Topics, ie, a set of pre-critical representations providing a ground for argumentation). In my paper, I will show that behind the issue of the status of the argument by historical example lies the more fundamental issue of the identity of rhetoric. Indeed, our civic life, our educational systems, but also, influential argumentative theories (in particular, the pragma-dialectical theory) lead us to conceive deliberation as a means to achieve an enlightened standpoint that may drive us to the best choice. However, the uncertain nature of most of the subjects on which we deliberate in the public sphere causes us continually having to act despite uncertainty. Thus, if rhetoric, defined as <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion,</b> seems to be necessary for decisions to be reached, it is also potentially a bad advisor. Through the study of selected historical examples used as arguments in contemporary political discourses (such as the “sputnik moment” used by Barack Obama in his 2011 State of the Union Adress), I will present the close relationship between uncertainty, persuasion and decision. The aim is to understand the kind of “certainties” that can be produced by rhetorical skills. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

[...] According to Aristotle, this <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion</b> {{could be used in}} public settings in three different ways. He writes in Book I, Chapter III, [...] "A member of the assembly decides about future events, a juryman about past events: while those who merely decide on the orator's skill are observers.

40|$|The first eleven {{chapters}} of the book Guiguzi 鬼谷子 are ascribed to Master Guigu, the alleged teacher of the two famous rhetoricians Su Qin 蘇秦 and Zhang Yi 張儀. These chapters provide a methodological approach to the <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion</b> which is fundamentally different from European rhetoric. Whereas European rhetoric, originating in Greek rhetoric, is mainly concerned with the <b>persuasion</b> <b>of</b> big audiences in public forums and institutions such as assemblies (the agora as birthplace of democracy) and courtrooms, the persuasive strategies in the Guiguzi mainly focus on the involvement with an individual counterpart. In the Guiguzi listening to and assessing the particular type of opponent and then taking advantage of his individual preferences is most decisive for the success <b>of</b> <b>persuasion.</b> The Guiguzi does not teach how to formulate a perfect piece <b>of</b> rhetorical <b>art</b> which accords to all rules of a commonly shared system of persuasive logic {{as it is known}} from European rhetorical traditions. From this different approach also follows a different set of systematic problems in the <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion.</b> The typology <b>of</b> formal figures of speech, so important in European rhetoric, is not as important as the exact typology of human characters which have to be correctly identified to be correlated to the types of speech which have the greatest persuasive effect on them. Each of the eleven chapters discusses a particular method <b>of</b> <b>persuasion</b> in an analysis of different aspects of the communicative process in which persuasion takes place.
