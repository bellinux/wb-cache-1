50|$|LONG-FORM math The gross {{total amount}} of <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> {{following}} the leveraged purchase {{is equal to the}} total quantity of asset purchased multiplied by the Asset Return. In this case, the quantity of asset purchased is equal to 9 (8 from loan funds + 1 from equity funds) and the Asset Return is +5%. So the gross total profit from the leveraged asset purchase = 9 times +5% = +45% gross total profit from leveraged asset purchase. To arrive at net profit, the leverage cost is subtracted from the gross total costs. The cost of the loan is 4% of the loan amount, and the loan is 8 per dollar of equity or 8 times −4% = −32% cost. So the sum of total profit and total cost is +45% profit minus 32% cost = 13% net profit from the leveraged purchase per dollar of equity investment = expected leverage return on equity investment.|$|E

In basic terms it {{is a measure of}} the actual revenue earned by assets against the potential revenue they could have earned. Rental utilization is divided into a number of different calculations, and not all companies work precisely the same way. In general terms however there are 2 key calculations: the physical utilization on the asset, which is measured based on the number of available days for rental against the number of days actually rented. (This may also be measured in hours for certain types of equipment), and the financial utilization on the asset (referred to in North America as $ Utilization) which is measured as the rental revenue achieved over a period of time against the potential revenue that could have been achieved based on a target or standard, non-discounted rate.|$|E
40|$|All asset-intensive organisations {{have some}} sort of <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> targets in place. How {{legitimate}} are these targets? Are they achievable given the resources and span of the control of the manager responsible? Are they fair? Is it clear how targets for <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> measures should be set? Drawing on performance measurement literature and current practice, we identify factors to be considered in setting targets for <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> metrics. The resulting framework comprises four steps: 1) the identification of factors influencing the performance metric, 2) the identification of interventions within the control of the asset manager that could influence the metric, 3) data collection and statistical analysis to identify the influence of these interventions, 4) simulation of future performance of the metric to establish targets or ranges of acceptable performance. The framework is illustrated using an <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> metric, pipe blockages, for asset managers of regional waste water assets. Findings are: 1) target setting involves a deep understanding of what influences the metric, and this requires data collection, cleaning and validation, as well as liaison with experts, 2) the importance of establishing how the metric can be influenced by factors beyond the immediate control of the asset manager, this affects its legitimacy, and 3) the opportunity presented by simulation to provide target ranges appropriate for the variability in many <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> metrics. The absence of expected relationships raises questions about the appropriateness of the metric, the effectiveness of the work and/or the data quality. Asset managers should be careful setting targets to <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> measures. The process developed in this paper can be used to inform target setting activities.

40|$|Business {{performance}} is contingent upon effective use {{and management of}} all resources to enhance competitive advantage. With the growing focus toward performance measurement, the need to measure the performance of operational assets has become more pressing, giving rise {{to a number of}} issues relating to definition and selection of <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. For many organizations, the selection of key performance indicators (KPIs) is not considered in a structured manner. Very often the process involves a selection from a list(s) of indicators without due consideration of the stakeholders’ perspective which may vary with different time horizons with which the assets are viewed. As there are several stakeholders (owner/investor; facility/property manager; user/client; and the public/visitors) with an interest in the performance of a facility, it is important to define each stakeholder/s ‘world view’ and their relative influence on performance. Each stakeholder will see different things that are important with respect to <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> dependent on the time horizon considered. If KPIs are directly linked to what is considered important, then different sets of KPIs will be relevant to different stakeholders according to the relevant time horizons. Typically, KPIs selection has not made this distinction, resulting in an incomplete and possibly inaccurate assessment of <b>asset</b> <b>performance.</b> Careful ongoing monitoring of KPI’s is a key approach to optimizing (as opposed to maximizing) <b>asset</b> <b>performance.</b> Inherent contradictions between individual sets of KPI’s also mean that the assessment of <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> is likely to attract considerable variation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a conceptual framework of stakeholders’ perspectives relative to typical business time horizons and how they in turn should influence the selection of relevant and meaningful <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> indicators.

40|$|Road {{assets are}} {{constructed}} {{to accommodate the}} needs of people and to serve various functions associated with such needs over their service life. In this study, the principles and framework of a performance-based road asset management system (PBRAMS) are established to practically and efficiently maintain desired services over the service life of road assets under limited resources. The main components of the PBRAMS, such as road network hierarchy, <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> measurement, maintenance cost and effect modeling, <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> modeling and asset management optimization, are discussed. One major function of the PBRAMS is the road asset management optimization model in terms of appropriate <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> modeling and predetermined management policy {{in order to make}} optimal asset management plans. In this study, asset management optimization models have been developed with illustrative examples on the basis of different <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> models including time-based renewal process, discrete-time Markov process and discrete-time semi-Markov process. The results are obtained and compared to show the applicability of different asset management optimization models. Moreover, this study considers the social impacts in the road asset management. Major social cost components are identified and general cost models are built. A multiobjective optimization model has been developed to incorporate social costs into the road asset management optimization and an example is given to illustrate the use of this multiobjective model. Systematically incorporating key road asset management components, the PBRAMS provides a solid foundation for a road agency to predict <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> over the service life of its managed road assets and to optimize the short- and/or long-term asset management plans...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The last {{untapped}} {{margin of}} {{improvement in the}} manufacturing process {{is believed to be}} the improvement of physical asset maintenance. The latest opportunity is to move this process to a real time system. Although in recent years it has become somewhat of a cliché, the successful management of the human factor is one of the most critical components, and also one of the most difficult to manage, in all improvement projects. By combining the groundbreaking opportunity in <b>Asset</b> <b>Performance</b> Management with an enthusiasm for people and process improvement, the focus of this research is found. The motivation stems from a realization that <b>Asset</b> <b>Performance</b> Management will undergo radical changes and that it would not be sufficient to apply the traditional methods of managing change to the younger generations, that are currently entering the workforce and that would have to run this improved system. The industry trend was studied in order to better facilitate a solution that would suit this natural evolution. Specifically, trends were studied on Human, Information and Technology levels since background studies have shown that these three components are key to the Physical <b>Asset</b> <b>Performance</b> Management scenario. Through an in-depth literature study, the answers to the predetermined research questions were determined. To guide companies through the transition towards the real time enterprise as well as improve overall machine performance (research origin), the HIT Interaction model for real time Physical <b>Asset</b> <b>Performance</b> Management is proposed. A structure is also facilitated by which companies can be evaluated in terms of the stages of readiness for real time operation.

40|$|A key {{aspect of}} asset {{management}} is {{the determination of}} the performance level at which a standard intervention is to be applied. A profligate policy, where an intervention is applied when the asset {{is in a state of}} higher performance, would mean frequent and premature spending of agency funds even though the users derive benefits of perpetually superior <b>asset</b> <b>performance.</b> This would result in little incremental benefit and can be considered a waste of agency funds. On the other hand, a parsimonious policy, where an intervention is applied when the asset is in a state of lower performance, leads to the avoidance of agency spending at the cost of severe user consequences of poor <b>asset</b> <b>performance.</b> In between these two extremes, there exists a certain optimal performance threshold for intervention application that is consistent with the maximum possible benefits and minimum possible costs. Given the paucity of analytical research on the explicit and rigorous resolution of this issue, agencies have resorted to non-analytical methods such as averaging of historical pre-treatment performance levels or questionnaire survey of experts. ^ With this background, this dissertation introduces a systematic and logical methodology for establishing the optimal <b>asset</b> <b>performance</b> threshold or trigger for any intervention. This methodology is rooted in simple but robust and widely-known concepts that identify the optimal control decision parameters to yield minimum overall cost at maximum possible benefit or the highest cost-effectiveness. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, thresholds for two pavement maintenance and rehabilitation treatments are established. Highway agencies can use this methodology to establish appropriate performance thresholds for their specific pavement treatments and also for bridge, safety, and mobility interventions. ...|$|E
