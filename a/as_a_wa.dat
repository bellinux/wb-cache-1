40|$|This {{study on}} Thornton Wilder's The Cabala is {{intended}} to analyze what the causes {{and the results of}} the Cabalists' depression are. From tlie discussion, it is revealed that tlie various failures, which are faced by Marcantonio, Alix and Astree-Luce, are the main causes of their depression. The failures which are faced by Marcantonio are tlie failure in getting rid of his bad habit and in becoming a successful athlete. Alix has the failure to be loved by her family and James Blair, while Astree-Luce's failure is to have a religious support. The inability to accept the failures arouses the feelings which make those Cabalists more depressed. Being haunted by the intense depression, finally they try to find solutions to rid tiiemselves from their depressed feelings. The ways that they choose are by doing actions which not only injure themselves but almost hurt other person as well. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>wa)</b> ' to overcome depression, Marcantonio chooses to kill himself while Alix also tries to commit suicide, and the other Cabalist, Astree-Luce, makes an attempt to murder the Cardinal Vaini. So, actually, the deeds that they have already done are the results of their depressed feeling...|$|E
40|$|The {{greatest}} truth {{we could}} hope to discover, in whatever field we discovered it, is that man’s truth is the final resolution of everything. — Wallace Stevens, “The Relations Between Poetry and Painting”. Many philosophers have been attracted by the view that colors are mindindependent properties of object surfaces. A leading, and increasingly popular, version of this view that has been defended {{in recent years is}} the so-called physicalist position that identifies colors with (classes of) spectral reflectance distributions. 1 This view, has, however, come in for a fair bit of criticism for failing to do justice to the facts about perceptual variation. 2 Recently, however, Byrne and Hilbert (2004) have argued that this criticism can be met. They compare cases of perceptual variation involving color to other cases of representational variation involving temperature, point out that such variation fails to undermine physicalism about temperature, and suggest, therefore, that variation is equally ineffective in blocking physicalism about color. In this paper I shall review the anti-physicalist argument from perceptual variation (§ 1) and the Byrne and Hilbert response to this argument (§ 2). Then I shall argue that this response is inadequate as it stands, insofar as attackers and defenders of color physicalism will disagree about whether the analogy on which it turns is applicable to the case in dispute (§§ 3 – 4). Finally, I shall appeal to facts about our inferential treatment of color and other properties <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wa...</b>|$|E
40|$|Patrick Weller {{looks at}} how Ian Campbell was sacrificed to {{political}} expediency IAN CAMPBELL {{has had a}} raw deal. He has lost his job as federal human services minister for holding a meeting in 2006. Nothing more. He is the sacrificial victim of standards applied retrospectively for political convenience. As far as we know, he agreed to meet a delegation of the West Australian Turf Association to discuss {{the establishment of an}} indigenous centre as part of a redevelopment. The meeting was set up by Julian Grill. When Grill arrived, he was accompanied by his partner, Brian Burke. The meeting lasted for 20 minutes. Nothing was agreed. Nothing was decided. That’s it. Campbell did not refuse to meet the delegation accompanied by Burke, whether from good manners, because he was overawed by the presence of a former premier or because he did not see it as significant. There is no evidence to put him {{on a par with the}} WA state Labor ministers who have been forced to resign. They breached cabinet confidentiality to tell Burke and Grill what cabinet was doing. They practised lines of argument, sought to influence the outcome and kept them informed of final decisions. They were effectively working for Burke and Grill, lobbyists who had financial benefits at stake. They breached their oath of office. Ministers who do not understand the basics of collective responsibility should not stay in cabinet. Campbell, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>WA</b> senator, would have known that Burke’s reputation was dubious. He would have known of then premier Geoff Gallop’s ban on ministers having contact with Burke and Grill, a ban that appears braver and wiser as the full range of Burke’s tentacles becomes known. Yet Campbell has been condemned for meeting the toxic 2007 version of Burke, rather than the merely dodgy Burke of 2006. No one would meet him now - nor will they meet Grill, and he has no convictions against his name. Every day ministers meet delegations that want something and a bank of lobbyists who help them. Look at the ministerial appointment diaries. Peddling influence is what lobbyists do. They open doors, access information, set up meetings to allow their clients to get their way. If there were to be real consistency, ministers would go back over their diaries to see if they had met anyone else who had once been convicted, or was under investigation or might come under investigation, whether for tax evasion, fraud or influence peddling. Future delegations may need police clearances to show they are not tainted. That won’t happen because it sets an impossible standard; ministers often, knowingly or unknowingly, meet people on the make, with propositions to put and dubious standards of behaviour. Remember that John Elliott was treasurer of the Liberal Party. Ministers may now look at the people they meet every day and hope none of them will come back to haunt (or even destroy) them as a consequence of activities undertaken after the meeting. Campbell had not broken any rule of the ministerial code. There was one bit of advice he might have heeded. The code suggests “that ministers should ensure their conduct is defensible and should consult with the prime minister when in doubt about the propriety of any course of action. ” At the time, no doubt, Campbell did not see anything to defend. One other action might have been wise. He should have told the Prime Minister he had met Burke before his seniors sought to eviscerate Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd for his meetings with Burke (assuming he knew the attack was coming). They might have moderated the hyperbole of their attacks had they known a colleague would be affected. Once they had laid their reputation on the line, once Peter Costello had declared “anyone who deals with Brian Burke is morally and politically compromised,” there was no doubt who was politically dispensable, who would be the dead parrot. Rudd’s 2005 meetings, too, were unwise; they would not have been held with 2007 knowledge. Whether it was a familiarisation tour for a future leadership contender or a casual dinner, he acknowledges he should not have met him. Graham Edwards, his host, would certainly have been aware of the Gallop ban and did Rudd no favours. Had either been aware of the terms of Burke’s invitations, they would have been even more cautious, although that could have been no more than an influence peddler big noting his connections. Note that Campbell and Rudd’s meetings were not secret at the time. They have become damaging in retrospect only because Burke’s later influence infected the WA political climate. There is no evidence that either meeting led to any improper action or exercise of influence. They are cases of history being rewritten for political advantage. Campbell’s resignation has nothing to do with any traditional interpretation of ministerial responsibility. In the early days of the Howard government a number of ministers resigned because they failed to fully declare their share holdings or because they fiddled their travel expenses (the same crime for which Burke and a number of Queensland Nationals state ministers went to jail). They were personal failings and they did breach explicit guidelines and rules that they knew and had endorsed. They paid the penalty. Since then a number of larger issues have arisen when ministerial staff have acted as a cordon sanitaire around ministers. Roads spending, children overboard and the AWB scandal provide examples where ministerial staff knew but ministers, we are assured, did not. (Where was the canny chief of staff to warn against meeting with Burke in this case, we may ask?) During a century of responsible government many ministers have been sacked because the prime minister thought they were not up to the job. Others have been forced to resign because of their actions. Always there is a calculation by the prime minister. As a sacked Liberal minister noted in 1976, in politics, resigning admits error and, politics being what it is, admitting error is often more damaging than the error itself. Is it better to tough it out or be remembered for a procession of corpses? In early days prime ministers tend to be stricter. Then they learn that few remember the scandals where no one resigns and choose to tough them out. Yet this incident is still unique, a sanction applied two years after the “error of judgment. ” Campbell’s action was not really the cause; the meeting just proved inconvenient. Standards were applied retrospectively. The minister was sacrificed to maintain the credibility of his seniors in a search to maintain some moral high ground. Campbell is collateral damage from friendly fire as the party warfare intensifies. That sets a precedent that will make other ministers nervous. • Patrick Weller is professor of politics and public policy at Griffith University and author of Cabinet Government in Australia 1901 - 2006 (UNSW Press, 2007).
