25|$|During {{the filming}} of the film <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wide</b> Missouri (1951), Montalbán was thrown from his horse, knocked unconscious, and trampled by another horse, which aggravated his {{arteriovenous}} malformation and resulted in a traumatic back injury that never healed. The pain increased as he aged, and in 1993, he underwent over nine hours of spinal surgery that left him paralyzed below the waist and requiring {{the use of a}} wheelchair. Despite constant pain, he continued to perform, providing voices for animated films and supporting his Nosotros foundation. Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez created a role in his Spy Kids film series specifically for Montalbán, which included the use of a jet-propelled wheelchair.|$|E
25|$|Edible {{though not}} marketed, the wide stingaree is caught {{incidentally}} {{on a regular}} basis in otter trawls utilized by the Great Australian Bight Trawl Sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), and to a much lesser extent by the small-scale Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDWTF) in the westernmost portion of its range. Captured individuals are unlikely to survive as they are brought up from such great depths, and furthermore stingarees have a tendency to abort their young when captured. However, the SESSF only operates over part of the Great Australian Bight, and so the overall level of fishing pressure <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> stingaree's range is low. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern.|$|E

2500|$|Nilsen {{was a quiet}} yet adventurous child. His {{earliest}} {{childhood memories}} were of family picnics in the Scottish countryside {{with his mother and}} siblings, of his grandparents' pious lifestyle (which he would later describe as being [...] "cold and dour"), and of being taken on long countryside walks as he sat on the shoulders of his maternal grandfather, to whom Nilsen was particularly close. Although Olav Jr. and Sylvia would occasionally accompany Dennis and his grandfather on these walks, on most occasions, Dennis alone would accompany his grandfather. Despite only being 5 years old, Nilsen vividly recalled these walks with his grandfather as being [...] "very long ... along the harbour, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> stretch of beach, up to the sand-dunes, which rise thirty feet behind the beach ... and on to Inverallochy". Nilsen would later describe this stage of his childhood as being one of contentment, and his grandfather being his [...] "great hero and protector", adding that, whenever his grandfather (who worked as a fisherman) was at sea, [...] "Life would be empty [...] until he returned".|$|E
2500|$|During Shepherd’s career, {{he wrote}} and co-authored over 30 books and around 200 {{original}} articles including the five volumes of the Handbook of Psychiatry. However, perhaps his finest literary legacy was the establishment {{of what has been}} described as [...] "arguably the finest psychiatric journal in the English-speaking world", the journal Psychological Medicine. He was the founding editor of Psychological Medicine from 1969 until 1993. It {{is interesting to note that}} he favoured the term [...] "Psychological Medicine" [...] over [...] "Psychiatry" [...] and he attached great importance to the title which he resurrected from the Journal of Psychological Medicine, first conceived by Forbes Winslow. He defined psychological medicine as including not only psychiatry but also the study of abnormal behaviour from the medical point of view. He aimed to concentrate on original high-quality work <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> spectrum of both psychiatry and its allied disciplines and contributed extensively himself investing much time and care towards its success. According to his successor, Psychological Medicine was to become perhaps his greatest and most enduring creation set in an academic and research career which was already highly distinguished.|$|E

2500|$|Reno {{advanced}} rapidly {{across the}} open field towards the northwest, his movements masked by the thick bramble of trees that ran along the southern banks of the Little Bighorn River. The same trees on his front right shielded his movements <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> field over which his men rapidly rode, first with two approximately forty-man companies abreast and eventually with all three charging abreast. The trees also obscured Reno's view of the Native American village until his force had passed that bend on his right front and was suddenly within arrow-shot of the village. The tepees in that area were occupied by the Hunkpapa Sioux. Neither Custer nor Reno had much idea of the length, depth {{and size of the}} encampment they were attacking, as the village was hidden by the trees. When Reno came into the open in front of {{the south end of the}} village, he sent his Arikara/Ree and Crow Indian scouts forward on his exposed left flank. Realizing the full extent of the village's width, Reno quickly suspected what he would later call [...] "a trap" [...] and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment.|$|E
