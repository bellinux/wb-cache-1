5|$|The {{cause of}} Domery's <b>appetite</b> is not known. While {{there are other}} {{documented}} cases of similar behaviour from this period none of the subjects other than Domery's contemporary Tarrare were autopsied, {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases of polyphagia (excessive <b>appetite)</b> as extreme as Domery. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme <b>appetite</b> and rapid weight loss, while Bondeson(2006) speculates that Domery possibly suffered from a damaged amygdala or ventromedial nucleus; it is known that injuries to the amygdala or ventromedial nucleus in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E

5|$|In French cuisine, {{beverages}} that precede a meal {{are called}} apéritifs (literally: {{that opens the}} <b>appetite),</b> and can be served with amuse-bouches (literally: mouth amuser). Those that end it are called digestifs.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in <b>appetite</b> regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and <b>appetite.</b> The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E

5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of <b>appetite,</b> intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain.

5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his <b>appetite.</b> Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his <b>appetite.</b> Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E

5|$|Labradors have a {{well-known}} reputation for <b>appetite,</b> and some individuals may be highly indiscriminate, eating digestible and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food.

5|$|Nirjarā is {{possible}} through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas {{can be either}} external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of <b>appetite,</b> accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of <b>appetite.</b> Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E

50|$|According to Chinese folk tales, fish cakes {{have had}} more than 4000 years’ history. In ancient times, an emperor called Shun {{travelled}} to Southern China with his two wives.

A fisher called Bo came and gave Shun his fish cakes. Shun’s wives really enjoyed them, and their <b>appetites</b> returned to normal. Shun was so pleased that he asked the fisher Bo to teach other people how to make fish cakes, so everyone can enjoy food even when they have bad <b>appetites.</b> Fish cakes them became popular in China.|$|R

5|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that nonpathogenic strains of H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by normalizing stomach acid secretion, and {{may play a role}} in regulating <b>appetite,</b> since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato's allegory of the cave.

5|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss of <b>appetite,</b> abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems.
