50|$|If {{the heating}} process is {{relatively}} slow, the liquid has {{enough time to}} relax to an equilibrium state and the liquid follows the binodal curve, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is still valid. During this time heterogeneous evaporation occurs in the substance with bubbles nucleating from impurity sites, surfaces, grain boundaries etc. On the other hand, if the heating process is fast enough that the substance cannot reach binodal curve through heterogeneous boiling, the liquid becomes superheated with its temperature above boiling point at a given pressure. System then shifts away from the binodal and continues to follow the red curve and thus approaches towards spinodal. Near the critical temperature thermodynamic properties like specific heat, density varies rapidly <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>on</b> the <b>figure</b> at right. Density and entropy undergoes largest fluctuation. During this time {{it is possible to}} have a large density fluctuation in a very small volume. This fluctuation of density results in the nucleation of a bubble. The bubble nucleation process occurs homogeneously everywhere in the substance. The rate of bubble nucleation and vapor sphere growth rate increases exponentially closer to the critical temperature. The increasing nucleation prevents the system from going to the spinodal. When the bubble radius reaches the critical size it continues to expand and eventually explodes resulting a mixture of gas and droplets which is termed as explosive boiling or phase explosion.|$|R

40|$|Collision {{detection}} is {{an ongoing}} source of research and optimization in many fields including video-games and numerical simulations [6, 7, 8]. The goal of collision detection is to report a geometric contact when it is about to occur or has actually occurred. Unfortunately, detailed and exact collision detection for large amounts of objects represent an immense amount of computations, naively n 2 operation with n being the number of objects [9]. To avoid and reduce these expensive computations, the collision detection is decomposed in two phases <b>as</b> it <b>shown</b> <b>on</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 : the Broad-Phase and the Narrow-Phase. In this paper, we focus on Broad-Phase algorithm in a large dynamic three-dimensional environment. We studied two kinds of Broad-Phase algorithms: spatial partitioning and spatial sorting. Spatial partitioning techniques operate by dividing space {{into a number of}} regions that can be quickly tested against each object. Two types of spatial partitioning will be considered: grids and trees. The grid-based algorithms consist of a spatial partitioning processing by dividing space into regions and testing if objects overlap the same region of space. And this reduces the number of pairwise to test. The tree-based algorithms use a tree structure where each node spans a particular space area. This reduces the pairwise checking cost because only tree leaves are checked. The spatial sorting based algorithm consists of a sorted spatial ordering of objects. Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) are projected onto x, y and z axes and put into sorted lists. By sorting projection onto axes, two objects collide if and only if they collide on the three axes. This axis sorting reduces the number of pairwise to tested by reducing the number of tests to perform to only pairs which collide on at least one axis. For this study, ten different Broad-Phase collision detection algorithms or framework have been considered. The Bullet [6], CGAL [10, 11] frameworks have been used.

Measurements have been performed from 6 to 11 th September by BRGM and Geomedia staff, with the logistic help of Litoměřice city. The survey aims at measuring electrical resistivity at depth to image the main geological features underground until few kilometers in urban areas with the challenging problem of cultural noise. Because the first method (MT) can be severely affected by electromagnetic (EM) noise induced by anthropogenic activities such as cities and industries and DC trains such as in Czech Republic (and many regions in Europe), CSEM (active controlled-source electromagnetics) and MT (passive method, natural sources) data were both collected to be able to provide a resistivity imaging of the area. 27 CSEM stations and 7 collocated MT stations have been recorded. The CSEM survey has been conducted using surface and borehole high power emissions and two pseudo-orthogonal polarizations. A set of frequencies ranging between 0. 125 Hz to 128 Hz has been selected to investigate the medium. Results provide apparent resistivity maps at various frequencies and for both polarizations reflecting the geological variations from north to south. MT robust signal processing has been performed using synchronous recordings performed locally (30 km) and at far (> 500 km) remote stations. Data were processed using advanced robust techniques in each possible configurations (3 remote reference stations and single site processing). As the ambient noise and MT sources are not stationary, a time-lapse approach based on an error threshold was used to select the best MT estimates.

The self-heating phenomenon on the Schottky barrier diodes has been highly investigated during the characterization process [3]. The Boron doped CVD has been widely used for these Schottky diodes, offering the best performances in specific ON resistance (Ron) vs Breakdown Voltage figure of merit. Due to the incomplete ionization of Boron dopants at room temperature, the self-heating effect {{can be used to}} decrease the diamond semiconductor forward losses. Moreover, a particular attention needs to be done on the parallelization of diamond Schottky diodes due to a negative temperature coefficient (from 0 K to 400 - 600 K) and a positive one (above 400 - 600 K depending on the doping level), an accurate temperature management system is then required. We propose here a monolithic integration of a small area Schottky barrier diode used as a wide range temperature sensor. The diode voltage drop is used as a thermosensitive parameter at a constant forward bias current. The linear variation of this voltage drop on a temperature range, from room temperature to 440 K, at a constant bias current density of 2. 5 A/cm² allows a sensor sensitivity of 1. 5 mV/K. It is also demonstrated that this integrated temperature sensor is affected by the biasing conditions of the main Schottky diode, which is monolithically integrated <b>as</b> it is <b>shown</b> <b>on</b> <b>Figure</b> 2.

40|$|International audienceRemote sensing of the sea-ice {{thickness}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} objectives of the Ku-band radar altimeter SIRAL-CRYOSAT II mission. On the one hand, sea-ice thickness is derived from the measurement of the height of the freeboard of the floes, and based on isostasy, assuming that the density of the water, the ice, as well as the snow, are known. On the other hand even if the snow load is known, the penetration of the electromagnetic waves into the snow strongly depends on the electrical and geophysical characteristics of the snow layer (density, temperature, permittivity, roughness). The remote sensing of the snow layer thickness (SLT) remains a real challenge and will be useful to correct the snow load for converting freeboard measurements from satellite altimetry into sea-ice thickness. If the dual frequency radar altimetry data show a good potential for remote sensing of snow and more generally of penetrating media [1], providing the SLT from Ku band data alone is highly motivated by the orbit of CRYOSAT designed to cover the entire Arctic. In this framework, a theoretical study, based on a 3 D modelling of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a stratified medium at normal incidence has been carried out in order to investigate and quantify the capacity of snow and ice penetration of Ku-band waves. The stratified medium is modelled as a snow layer considered as a stack of 2 sub-layers and the boundary layer at the bottom represented by a semi-infinite layer of ice-sea <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>on</b> the <b>figure</b> 1. The roughness of each interface is taken into account and the small slope approximation (SSA) is used to determine the coherent and incoherent components of the scattered intensity [2 - 4]. It is demonstrated that the coherent intensity is the the specular direction but it depends on the rms-roughness heights and does not depends on the shape of the correlation function. The incoherent intensity depends even on the rms-roughness heights, but also on the shape of the correlati- n function. Several simulations have been conducted by varying the permittivity, thickness and roughness of each interface [5 - 6]. The 3 interfaces are random processes with Gaussian autocorrelation functions with zero mean values. The main conclusion is that the backscattered signal from the stratified medium is strongly related to the dielectric characteristics. It can vary significantly even if the variations of the stratified medium are small. This is an important result to be kept in mind when attempting the signal inversion. In addition, another similar study based on a 2 D modelling of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by the same stratified medium at normal incidence and simulations in the same conditions have been previously conducted [7]. The roughness of each interface was also taken into account and the first-order small perturbation method (SPM) was used to determine the coherent and incoherent components of the scattered intensity.
