Although he and Thatgamecompany can <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up {{transcendental}} meditation {{and turned his}} attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{progress}} in Big Bang cosmology {{has been made}} since the late 1990s {{as a result of}} advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP.

5|$|The Brewers {{have made}} ten {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> one first overall selection in the draft. They have also had three compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Brewers have failed to sign four of their first-round picks; Bill Bordley (1976), Alex Fernandez (1988), Kenny Henderson (1991), and Dylan Covey (2010).|$|E

These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Tigers failed to sign their 1966 first-round pick, Rick Konik, but they received no compensatory pick.|$|E
5|$|The second book, Thunder and Shadow, was {{released}} on September 6, 2016. It follows Twigkit and Violetkit's lives in ThunderClan and ShadowClan. The two kits struggle to find their place in their respective clans, and feel lonely. However, Alderpaw and Needlepaw befriend the kits, and even arrange for them to meet in secret between the two clans' borders. The Clan cats discover that the rogues from A Vision of Shadows followed the quest cats to the lake, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> camp near ShadowClan. Meanwhile, the ShadowClan apprentices start to lose faith in the warrior code, {{and many of them}} eventually join the rogues, including Needlepaw, who brings Violetkit with her.|$|E
5|$|Tammars {{from these}} areas were {{introduced}} to Kawau Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870. Since then, they have flourished {{to the point where}} their foraging has damaged indigenous plants. Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate, a naturally occurring rodenticide, to control their populations, a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative. In 1985, tammars {{were introduced to}} the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals. In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Four releases have been made, and a stable wild population of 100–120 animals exists as of 2012. Tammars have also been successfully translocated to other areas, such as Nambung National Park and Avon Valley National Park in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Toronto Argonauts {{have won}} the most Grey Cup championships (16), {{followed}} by the Edmonton Eskimos (14) and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (10). The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have made the most Grey Cup appearances (24). Since the Canadian Football League began in 1958, the Eskimos {{have won the}} most Grey Cup Championships (11) <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the most Grey Cup appearances (19). The Saskatchewan Roughriders have the most losses in Grey Cup play (15), including five consecutive losses between 1928 and 1932. The defending champions are the Ottawa Redblacks, who won the 104th Grey Cup in 2016. Six teams in CFL history have won the Grey Cup at home, the 2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders, the 2012 Toronto Argonauts, the 2011 BC Lions, the 1994 BC Lions, the 1977 Montreal Alouettes, and 1972 Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Blue Bombers were the losing team in 2011, extending Winnipeg's championship drought {{at the time to}} 21 seasons, and at 26 seasons (1991-2016) is the longest active streak in the CFL.|$|E
5|$|Three Athletics' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Reggie Jackson (1966) won World Series titles {{with the team}} in 1972, 1973, and 1974. Mark McGwire (1984) and Walt Weiss (1985) won with the 1989 championship team. Four A's first-round picks {{have gone on to}} win the Rookie of the Year Award: McGwire in 1987, Weiss in 1988, Ben Grieve (1994) in 1998, and Huston Street (2004) in 2005. Jackson also won a Most Valuable Player award in 1973, and Barry Zito (1999) won a Cy Young Award in 2002, making them the A's only picks to win these awards. Reggie Jackson, elected in 1993, is their only pick in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Although eligible McGwire has not been elected despite over 500 career home runs and briefly holding the single-season home run record (70). Some see McGwire's exclusion as a sign that the Hall is hesitant to elect players suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs as McGwire was suspected of steroid use (he later admitted his use in 2010). The Athletics have made eighteen selections in the supplemental round of the draft <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection once: in the first draft in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Marlins' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Charles Johnson (1992) won a World Series title on the 1997 championship team and Josh Beckett (1999) won with the 2003 team. Beckett also {{went on to}} be a part of the Boston Red Sox 2007 World Series championship team. Chris Coghlan (2006) is the only first-round pick of the Marlins to win the Rookie of the Year Award, taking the honor in 2009. None of their first-round picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame or won the Most Valuable Player or Cy Young Award. The Marlins have made three selections in the supplemental round of the draft <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection once (2000). They have also had five compensatory picks since their first draft in 1992. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Marlins have never failed to sign a first-round pick.|$|E

5|$|The Twins {{have made}} 16 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection twice (1983 and 2001). They have also had 18 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Twins have six times failed to sign their first-round pick. Eddie Leon (1965), Dick Ruthven (1972), Jamie Allen (1976), and Tim Belcher (1983) all failed to sign with the Twins without the team receiving compensation. The Twins did, however, receive a compensatory pick when they failed to sign Jason Varitek (1993). Varitek did not sign and instead chose to enter the draft again the following year and was taken by the Seattle Mariners. Additionally, Travis Lee, the Twins' only selection in 1996 and the second-overall pick of that draft, did not sign with the team. Lee's agent, Scott Boras, did not communicate with the Twins for the first two weeks after the draft and then invoked a rarely used rule that a team was required to make a contract offer within 15 days of the draft or relinquish their rights to the player. As a result, Lee and 3 other 1996 first-round picks who were Boras clients were granted free agency and he ultimately signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
