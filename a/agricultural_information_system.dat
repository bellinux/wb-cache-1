For most of this period, however, it was the University of Bonn who developed and maintained the resulting models, under contract to Eurostat. The model as a whole was called the SPEL/EU-system and consisted of three parts: a base model, a short-term forecast model and a medium-term forecast model. With most of the data in the base model coming directly from Eurostat, it was Eurostat’s eventual aim that it should be able to maintain this base model itself. To this end, development of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (AgrIS) was started in 1999. The AgrIS continues to use the concepts of the SPEL-system.

The amount of information related to the administration system during the early stage of development in Hokkaido has been increased remarkably by the analysis of public documents of the Hokkaido Development Agency, called hutatsu. This paper aims to clarify the institutional development of the agricultural statistics system during the early Meiji era of Hokkaido and evaluate the accuracy of the statistics by surveying the public documents. Although the agency began to collect statistics in 1870, the jurisdiction of statistical services and the statistics division in the agency were clarified by a regulation enacted in 1875. The new agricultural statistical information system, which covers areas in remote locations, was developed in 1877.

Structured interviews were used to collect data from 64 randomly selected conventional and all 39 organic hazelnut producers living in the study area. <b>Information</b> <b>systems</b> for organic and conventional producers were found to be different. Organic producers benefited from more information sources than conventional producers. In addition, the contract farming approach to organic agriculture had initially isolated organic producers from conventional producers. Furthermore, dissatisfaction from the organic marketing company and its organic production project resulted in further separation among organic producers and led some of them to establish their own union. The lack of access to information and support from the organic project-related sources, professional institutions and mass media sources was evident. This resulted in the development of social sources to exchange information among the producers within their villages.
