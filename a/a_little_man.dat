25|$|This task is {{designed}} to measure spatial memory abilities in children. The experimenter asks the participant to visualize a blank matrix with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man.</b> Through a series of directional instructions such as forwards, backwards, left or right, the experimenter guides the participant's little man on a pathway throughout the matrix. At the end, the participant is asked to indicate on a real matrix where the little man {{that he or she}} visualized finished. The length of the pathway varies depending on the level of difficulty (1-10) and the matrices themselves may vary in length from 2 x 2 cells to 6 x 6.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|Given Kimball's {{history of}} health problems, many people, {{including}} Kimball himself, {{did not anticipate}} him living long enough {{to become president of}} the LDS Church. However, on December 23, 1973, Harold B. Lee, who was four years younger than Kimball and had long been in much better health, unexpectedly died, leaving Kimball as the most senior apostle and thus the presumptive new church president. Kimball was ordained church president on December 30, 1973, the day after Lee's funeral, choosing N. Eldon Tanner and Marion G. Romney as his first and second counselors. Boyd K. Packer recalled shortly afterward discovering Kimball sitting alone in the church president's office and quietly weeping: [...] "I am such <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> for such a big responsibility!" ...|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973. [...] "Be Here Now" [...] {{appeared as}} the second track on side two of the original LP format, following what Rodriguez describes as the [...] "funky uptempo" [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)". It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned thing off during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E

[...] Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission, but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock, [...] "Let him begin when he dare... he shall not take us unawares." [...] Later in the day, Pecksuot approached Standish, looking down on him, and said, [...] "You are a great captain, yet you are but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man.</b> Though I be no sachem, yet I am of great strength and courage." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Disney {{found that}} the new Pinocchio was too {{helpless}} and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, {{in the summer of}} 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy, and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions. Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a [...] "Soup Eating Sequence" [...] in Snow White, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> with an egg head and no ears. [...] "The only thing that makes him a cricket is because we call him one," [...] Kimball later joked.|$|E
2500|$|Nicephorus {{claims that}} Paul was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man,</b> crooked, and almost bent like a bow, with a pale countenance, long and wrinkled, and a bald head. Pseudo-Chrysostom echoes Lucian's height of Paul, {{referring}} {{to him as}} [...] "the man of three cubits". Paul at one point compares himself as one who is like [...] "a miscarried/aborted child". This however probably does not suggest some kind of deformity such as being crooked or hunch-backed, that tormented him, but rather his view of his worthiness to become an apostle.|$|E

Old Dreamy narrates {{the story of the}} Snow Queen. [...] The young lovers, Kay and Gerda are in their window box garden, planting two roses together, which Kay calls [...] "our roses".|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes fairies are {{described}} as assuming the guise of an animal. In Scotland it was peculiar to the fairy women to assume the shape of deer; while witches became mice, hares, cats, gulls, or black sheep. In [...] "The Legend of Knocksheogowna", in order to frighten a farmer who pastured his herd on fairy ground, a fairy queen took on {{the appearance of a}} great horse, with the wings of an eagle, and a tail like a dragon, hissing loud and spitting fire. Then she would change into <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> lame of a leg, with a bull's head, and a lambent flame playing round it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, Bush's {{batting average}} dropped 47 points from the prior season to [...]234.

[...] Baseball Magazine that same year published a feature story on how a player's hands make him suitable for one position or another. The author wrote: [...] "Donie Bush is a wonderful shortstop all will agree. Bush is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> perhaps the shortest of stature in organized baseball.

2500|$|Captain (later Admiral) Harte is Aubrey's nemesis. [...] His {{hatred of}} Aubrey stems from Aubrey's cuckolding him in Master and Commander. While never calling Jack out, he {{nevertheless}} tries to foil Aubrey's professional advancement whenever possible unless he can personally profit from it, as when Aubrey is placed {{under his command}} in Post Captain, even though Aubrey fails to bring in many prizes. Harte is especially angry about this {{because he did not}} profit from the [...] "Sophie's" [...] many prizes in Master and Commander. Harte is described as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man,</b> somewhat resembling Lord St. Vincent in appearance but not in character.

2500|$|The Bronze Horseman symbolizes “Tsar Peter, {{the city}} of St Petersburg, and the uncanny reach of autocracy over the lives of {{ordinary}} people.” When Evgenii threatens the statue, he is threatening “everything distilled {{in the idea of}} Petersburg.” At first, Evgenii was just a lowly clerk that the Bronze Horseman could not deign to recognize because Evgenii was so far beneath him. However, when Evgenii challenges him, “Peter engages the world of Evgenii” as a response to Evgenii’s arrogance. The “statue stirs in response to his challenge” and gallops after him to crush his rebellion. [...] Before, Evgenii was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> that the Bronze Horseman would not bother to respond to. Upon Evgenii’s challenge, however, he becomes an equal and a rival that the Bronze Horseman must crush {{in order to protect the}} accomplishments he stands for.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Cardiacs {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album, <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Man</b> and a House and the Whole World Window. The single from the album, [...] "Is This The Life?", saw brief chart success due to exposure on mainstream radio, and garnered {{the attention of}} a wider audience when it entered the Independent Top 10 in the UK. The band followed up this burst of success with another single, a cover of The Kinks' [...] "Susannah's Still Alive" [...] with a video directed by Steve Payne. Strange Fruit Records also released a 12-inch vinyl EP of the band's BBC Radio 1 session from the previous year, under the title Night Tracks (The Janice Long Session). By this time, Cardiacs concerts were drawing hundreds of audience members and they were well on their way to becoming a hit underground band. On 15 May, the band played a concert at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, which was recorded for later release as Cardiacs Live.|$|E

There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all.
