25|$|About 200,000 tonnes of {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{are produced}} annually. The {{most widely used}} industrial process involves the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. Ashland/ISP is one the biggest producers of this chemical route. The method {{is similar to the}} production of diethyl ether from ethanol. The butanediol is derived from condensation of acetylene with formaldehyde followed by hydrogenation. DuPont developed <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>producing</b> THF by oxidizing n-butane to crude maleic anhydride, followed by catalytic hydrogenation. A third major industrial route entails hydroformylation of allyl alcohol followed by hydrogenation to the butanediol.|$|E

2500|$|In 1902, the French chemist Auguste Verneuil {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>producing</b> synthetic sapphire crystals. In the Verneuil process, {{named after}} him, fine alumina powder {{is added to}} an oxyhydrogen flame, and this is directed downward against a mantle. The alumina in the flame is slowly deposited, creating a teardrop shaped [...] "boule" [...] of sapphire material. Chemical dopants {{can be added to}} create artificial versions of the ruby, and all the other natural colors of sapphire, and in addition, other colors never seen in geological samples. Artificial sapphire material is identical to natural sapphire, except it can be made without the flaws that are found in natural stones. The disadvantage of Verneuil process is that the grown crystals have high internal strains. Many methods of manufacturing sapphire today are variations of the Czochralski process, which was invented in 1916 by Polish chemist Jan Czochralski. In this process, a tiny sapphire seed crystal is dipped into a crucible made of the precious metal iridium or molybdenum, containing molten alumina, and then slowly withdrawn upward at a rate of 1 to 100mm per hour. The alumina crystallizes on the end, creating long carrot-shaped boules of large size up to 200kg in mass.|$|E
