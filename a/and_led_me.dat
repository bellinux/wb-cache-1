500|$|The {{first two}} {{decisions}} to interpret § 8 construed {{it not to}} apply to the crimes charged. In United States v. Bevans (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to a murder committed on a navy vessel within state waters. In United States v. Palmer (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to piracy by U.S. citizen defendants, in the employ of a South American government at war with Spain, committed against Spanish ships and citizens. President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer. He wrote in his diary that the Court had [...] "cast away the jurisdiction which a law of congress had given, that its [...] "reasoning [...] a sample of judicial logic—disingenuous, false, and hollow," [...] and that it gave him [...] "an early disgust for the practice of law, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the unalterable determination never to accept judicial office." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she took}} me by the hand <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to where she had last seen Heliodore.|$|E
60|$|I {{did what}} he commanded, <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{through the door of}} the hut.|$|R
60|$|The {{messenger}} went. Jodd {{and some}} of the Northmen began to consult together, <b>and</b> Martina <b>led</b> <b>me</b> aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "None whatever---at once, if you like. This way, my dear Sir; this way," [...] <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{across the}} passage, into the dining-room.|$|R
60|$|The {{young woman}} returned, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> through a {{corridor}} {{to a door}} on which was painted Mr. Wailing.|$|E
60|$|After one searching look at me, the Major silently {{offered me}} his arm, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|So {{they took}} me <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the royal house, and pushed me through {{the doorway of the}} great hut.|$|E
60|$|He {{put an arm}} {{about my}} shoulder, fondly as a father might have done, <b>and</b> so <b>led</b> <b>me</b> below again <b>and</b> into my mother's presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{unfortunately}} true. The {{trouble was}} that your brother lives a long way off, <b>and</b> you <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to believe that your money was running out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jack. [Astounded.] Well [...] . surely. You {{know that}} I love you, <b>and</b> you <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to believe, Miss Fairfax, {{that you were}} not {{absolutely}} indifferent to me.|$|R
60|$|My uncle {{placed his}} hand upon my arm <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> slowly towards the gateway, through which my cousin Sibylle had already passed.|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled off}} his hat, and bowed with all the grace imaginable. But Jim Horscroft pulled me by the sleeve, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> aside.|$|E
60|$|So {{they took}} me <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> forth. With bowed head I went, looking not up, and yet I felt their eyes burn upon my face.|$|E
60|$|We got up, <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{on to the}} {{verandah}} which surrounded his house. We {{paused to}} look at the gay flowers that rioted in his garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "This way, sir," [...] <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> up the store. [...] "Miss Stone," [...] said he {{to a young}} lady, [...] "show {{this gentleman}} some red calico." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Second, I was {{a student}} of {{economics}} and sociology, reading, observing, meditating, <b>and</b> this <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to Socialism. Socialism is the social order corresponding to truth in the intellect.|$|R
60|$|He paused, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> away to {{the farther}} end of the yard, for the workmen had begun to arrive and to cluster round the dipping trough.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{she spoke}} she advanced, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to this plain where we now stand, {{and showed me}} her flock, but I paid little {{attention}} to it or to her.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} as so unkind, his having gone off in that way, that I burst into tears; and Uncle John came out, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here, and you'll {{know what}} I mean," [...] he answered. <b>And</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> down the passage {{to a window}} that {{overlooked}} {{the door of the}} prison. [...] "Look at that!" [...] said he.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent survey}} of {{approximately}} 200 specimens of the Colombian snakes currently assigned to the genera Leimadophis, Lygophis, Liophis, Rhadinaea, <b>and</b> Urotheca, has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to offer the following analysis of these groups in Colombia.

6000|$|... "But I {{am not the}} American," [...] pleaded the king. [...] "I {{tell you}} that the American came to my apartments last night, {{overpowered}} me, forced me to change clothing with him, <b>and</b> then <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] added her sister. [...] "Come, {{you must}} be obedient." [...] And still holding my hand she made me rise, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into the inner room.|$|E
60|$|She took my hand, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the sofa. We sat down, side by side. Her {{face was}} {{composed}} to a sad tranquillity. She was quiet; she was herself again.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Etherington met me at {{the door}} of his appartement, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to an inner room without speaking. Here he stood gazing, for some time, in my face, with {{paternal}} concern.|$|E
60|$|As the {{afternoon}} was waning I retraced my steps {{and returned to}} the ranch. The driver boy, whom I had heard called Dick, was looking for me, evidently at Miss Sampson's order, <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> up to the house.|$|R
60|$|With a {{friendly}} gesture {{he took me}} by the sleeve <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the open window which faced the east. Beneath us was the infantry camp, and beyond that {{the lines of the}} cavalry with the long rows of picketed horses.|$|R
50|$|I wish {{people could}} feel {{the power of the}} arts. That the arts can be in their living. It has been such a power in my life <b>and</b> has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into such {{beautiful}} pathways, that I would like everybody to have the experience.|$|R
60|$|He looked puzzled, as well he might. Then he smiled, {{took my hand}} <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{away from}} the door--to the knob of which I was still holding with all my might--to the sofa.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} key {{out of the}} lock, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> downstairs into the hall. After a little consideration, he {{opened the front door}} of the house. The {{gardener}} was still quietly at work in the grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{took me by}} the hand, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{out into}} the garden. When {{the captain of the}} guard saw me, he wondered. When the eunuchs saw me, their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{left the}} royal {{apartment}}, {{one of the}} female attendants came up and, putting her finger on her lip, signed to me to follow her. I did so, <b>and</b> she <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the apartment where the Queen and Princess Amenche were awaiting me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Ingleby, {{with a very}} bitter laugh. [...] "I am {{not sure}} that she is {{anything}} whatever to me. I, however, asked her to marry me not so very long ago, <b>and</b> she <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to believe that when circumstances were more propitious she might do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling, my dream's come true," [...] he said. [...] "You are my treasure. I {{found you}} {{here at the}} foot of the rainbow!... What if it is a stone rainbow--if all is not as I had dreamed? I {{followed}} a gleam. <b>And</b> it's <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to love <b>and</b> faith!" ...|$|R
