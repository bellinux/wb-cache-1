The process of CO 2 capture from flue gas is called „postcombustion‟ CO 2 capture. Existing plants may be retrofitted with this process to minimize CO 2 emission. Amine solutions are mostly used for this process to scrub the flue gas. Amine based CO 2 capture involves two-stage process. In <b>absorber</b> <b>column</b> flue gas containing CO 2 is scrubbed by amine solution to produce CO 2 -rich solution which is subsequently stripped off absorbed CO 2 by heating in a stripper column. The inlet flue gas to the <b>absorber</b> <b>column</b> must be ~ 40 0 C and hence needs cooling. On the other hand, subsequent stripping process needs significant heating. Thus process of post-combustion CO 2 capture has an energy penalty which reduces the overall efficiency of the plant.

Presence of biosulfur particles was found to enhance the absorption rate of H 2 S gas in the mildly alkaline liquid. The mechanism for this enhancement was however found {{to depend on the}} type of particles used. In the gently stirred cell reactor only small hydrophilic particles were present (dp < 3 ¿m) and the enhancement of the H 2 S absorption rate can be explained from the heterogeneous reaction between dissolved H 2 S and solid elemental sulfur to polysulfide ions, S x 2 -. Conditions favoring enhanced H 2 S absorption for these hydrophilic particles are: low liquid side mass transfer (KL), high sulfur content, and presence of polysulfide ions. In the set-up of gas <b>absorber</b> <b>column</b> and bioreactor, both small hydrophilic particles and larger, more hydrophobic particles were continuously produced (dp up to 20 ¿m).

A more likely explanation for enhancement here is the more hydrophobic behavior of the larger particles.

The CO 2 removal efficiency using the MEA solvent is the highest compared than DEA and MDEA solvent. Besides that, it is more realistic to used MEA concentration not more than 31. 5 wt. % as it can achieved 99. 8 % CO 2 removal efficiency and to avoid corrosion effect to equipment in real plant. As the lean solvent flow rate increases, the CO 2 removal efficiency for studied amines increases that can be arranged as the following order: MEA > DEA > MDEA. MEA shows high CO 2 removal efficiency because MEA is primary amine which has high CO 2 absorption capacity and reactivity than to DEA and MDEA. However, CO 2 removal efficiency was decrease as lean solvent temperature increase for all amines. This {{is due to the}} reduction of amine in lean solvent since it were vaporised before entering the absorber.

The simulations represent real-like operation of the integrated plant during load change transient events with closed-loop controllers. The focus {{of the study was}} the dynamic interaction between the power plant and the PCC unit, and the performance evaluation of decentralized control structures. A 613  MW three-pressure reheat NGCC with PCC using aqueous MEA was designed, including PCC process scale-up. Detailed dynamic process models of the power plant and the post-combustion unit were developed, and their validity was deemed sufficient for the purpose of application. Dynamic simulations of three gas turbine load-change ramp rates (2 %/min, 5 %/min and 10 %/min) showed that the total stabilization times of the power plant's main process variables are shorter (10 – 30  min) than for the PCC unit (1 – 4  h). A dynamic interaction between the NGCC and the PCC unit is found in the steam extraction to feed the reboiler duty of the PCC unit. The transient performance of five decentralized PCC plant control structures under load change was analyzed. When controlling the CO 2 capture rate, the power plant performs in a more efficient manner at steady-state part load; however, the PCC unit experiences longer stabilization times of the main process variables during load changes, compared with control structures without CO 2 capture rate being controlled. Control of L/G ratio of the <b>absorber</b> <b>columns</b> leads to similar part load steady-state performance and significantly faster stabilization times of the power plant and PCC unit's main process variables.

The principle of such a blend of a primary or secondary (alkanol) amine and a tertiary alkanolamine is based on the relatively high rate of reaction of CO 2 with the primary or secondary alkanolamine combined with the low heat of reaction of CO 2 with the tertiary alkanolamine, which leads to higher rates of absorption in the <b>absorber</b> <b>column</b> and lower heats of regeneration in the stripper section...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic MEA {{absorption}} {{process model}} has been developed to study the operability of this process in a dynamic fashion {{and to develop a}} control strategy to maintain the operation of the MEA scrubbing CO 2 capture process {{in the presence of the}} external perturbations that may arise from the transient operation of the power plant. The novelty in this work is that a mechanistic model based on the conservation laws of mass and energy have been developed for the complete MEA absorption process. The model developed in this work was implemented in gPROMS. The process response of the key output variables to changes in the key input process variables, i. e., the flue gas flow rate and the reboiler heat duty, are presented and discussed in this study. In order to represent the actual operation of a power plant, the dynamic response of the MEA absorption process to a sinusoidal change in the flue gas flow rate was also considered in the present analysis. The mechanistic dynamic model was applied to develop a basic feedback control strategy. The implementation of a control strategy was tested by changing the operating conditions for the flue gas flow rate. The controlled variables, i. e., the percentage of CO 2 absorbed in the <b>absorber</b> <b>column</b> and the reboiler temperature, were maintained around their nominal set point values by manipulating the valve stem positions, which determine the lean solvent feed flow rate at the top of the <b>absorber</b> <b>column,</b> and the reboiler heat duty, respectively. For the sinusoidal test, the amplitude of the oscillations observed for the controlled variables was smaller than those observed for the open-loop tests. This is because the variability of the controlled variables was transferred to the manipulated variable in the closed loop. The mechanistic dynamic model developed in this process can be potentially used as a practical tool that can provide insight regarding the dynamic operation of MEA absorption process. The model developed in this work can also be used as a basis to develop other studies related to the operability, controllability and dynamic flexibility of this process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Detecting H I using redshifted Lyα {{absorption}} lines is ∼ 10 6 times {{more sensitive than}} using the 21 cm emission line. We review recent discoveries of H I Lyα absorbers made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which have allowed us a first glimpse at gas in local intergalactic space {{between us and the}} “Great Wall”. Despite its mere 2. 4 m aperture, HST can detect <b>absorbers</b> with <b>column</b> densities as low as those found using Keck at high-z (NHI ≈ 10 12. 5 cm − 2). New results that will be discussed include: the evolution of absorbers with redshift, the location of absorbers relative to galaxies (including the two-point correlation function for absorbers), the metallicity of absorbers far from galaxies, and the discovery of hot ∼ 10 5 − 6 K (shock-heated?) absorbers. The unique ability of VLA H I observations in discovering the nearest galaxies to these absorbers is stressed. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the local}} universe, most QSO absorption-lines seem to arise from gas in {{extended}} 100 kpc halos around spiral galaxies. We present evidence that at high redshift, {{at least some}} absorption lines come from different sources: the gas is associated not with spiral galaxy halos but with the intra-cluster medium of proto-galaxy clusters. This gas, which is neutral and lumpy, may form a true intra-cluster medium, {{but it is more}} likely to be associated with the halos of young elliptical galaxies. This gas may turn into the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium of present-day rich galaxy clusters. 1. Introduction 1. 1. QSO Absorbers and Galaxy Halos QSO absorption lines are proving to be powerful probes of the gas within galactic halos. It is now fairly well established, at least at low redshifts (z ! 1), that most Lyff forest lines (neutral hydrogen <b>absorbers</b> with <b>column</b> densities of ! 10 16 cm Γ 2) and metal-line systems (metal-enriched absorbers with typical neutral columns of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this article, {{pilot plant}} data for CO 2 {{post-combustion}} capture are discussed and compared with modelling results. The objectives {{of this paper}} are to evaluate the overall performance of the CO 2 capture pilot plant using both experimental and simulation results. In addition, this work is aiming to assess the performance of two different modelling approaches (equilibrium-stage and rate-based) in representing the CO 2 capture process performance and requirement. Furthermore, an extended parametric study was carried out to evaluate both experiments and simulation tools. This work indicated {{that there are no}} major differences between the two modelling approaches in predicting the overall capture process behaviour (macro scale) for this pilot plant case. However, the simulation of the <b>absorber</b> and stripper <b>columns</b> demonstrated that the rate-based model gives a better prediction of the columns temperature profiles and mass transfer inside the columns compared to the equilibrium-stage approach (micro scale). As a result, for a detailed process design or understanding of the mass and energy profiles in the <b>absorber</b> and stripper <b>columns,</b> the rate-based approach should be applied. It was concluded that both modelling approaches can be used for predicting the capture process overall behaviour and requirement for pilot plant scale as well as for industrial scale application.
