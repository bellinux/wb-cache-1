50|$|The {{financial}} {{performance of the}} line was extremely disappointing, with an income of about £4 a week. The directors had borrowed additional money on overdraft against their personal guarantees, {{and there was no}} income to pay the interest on that debt.

Work continued rapidly, but early in 1874 Barnett and Gale got into financial difficulties, and the contract was transferred to J & G Taylor.

50|$|This brought {{considerable}} {{prosperity to}} the canal, and traffic volume rose, soon reaching {{the point where}} the canal was operating at full capacity. Consideration was then given to building a railway along the valley. A meeting held on 30 September 1857 confirmed this proposal, and a Special General Meeting of the Canal Company shareholders met on 13 October 1857; they agreed that they should build a railway. Parliamentary authority to do so was given, in the Liskeard and Looe Railway Act, on 11 May 1858. The Act did not establish a company of that name: the powers to build the railway were conferred on the existing Canal Company. £13,000 of <b>additional</b> <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> was sanctioned, with £4,000 of borrowing powers. Locomotive haulage was authorised, but locomotives were not to pass the end of Looe Bridge to reach Buller Quay on the level.|$|E
40|$|Beekeeping is a {{traditionally}} well-established household activity {{in almost all}} parts of Ethiopia. However, the benefit from the sub sector is not satisfactory compared to the existing potential. The objective {{of this study is}} conducted to identify the constraints of honey production in beekeeping cooperatives in Tigray Region, Killite Awlalo Woreda. Specifically, the study examined the social, environmental, and administrative constraints of these BKCs. The research design was survey type which incorporates 160 participants including 80 members and 80 nonmembers. Data collected for this study was processed using SPSS software and analyzed using descriptive statistics. As a result the Beekeeping cooperatives internal constraints which were identified by this study includes; lack of transparency, poor members participation controlling mechanism, limited capacity of BoD and lack of working capital. In addition, the study identified those constraints such as; honey bee pest attack, drought problems, distant location of apiary sites and increased price of beekeeping inputs as an external problems. Even if the BCKs do have a great potential to increase the honey productivity, due to the existence of these constraints, they didn’t bring significant progress yet in the study area. To minimize the impact of their internal constraints, BKCs are expected to enhance transparency and accountability. In addition BKCs are expected to strengthen their members’ equivalent participation together with its controlling mechanism to enhance the number of members which actually contributes for the increased honey productivity. As lack of working capital {{is also one of the}} problems of BKCs, they are expected to effectively mobilize members for <b>additional</b> <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> contribution. Due to distant location of apiary sites of BKCS at distant closure areas, their beehives are easily exposed for honey bee pests attack. Therefore, the day to day bee colony management work is expected from members to prevent the honey product decreased due to pest attack. Finally, to develop better bargaining power in the market, BKCs are expected to jointly collect, process and pack their better quality honey product. If integrated corrective actions are taken on these identified constraints of BKCs by members and stake holders, BKCs will play significant role on honey production and productivity in the study area...|$|E
5000|$|It {{soon became}} clear to the {{promoters}} of the railway that much work {{had to be done}} on the line after opening, due to the heavy use of the line. In February 1830 it was reported that 5,320 yards of track had been doubled, and that a further 2,000 yards would be doubled during the subsequent Spring, and the decision was taken to raise the <b>additional</b> £10,000 of <b>share</b> <b>capital,</b> authorised in the 1824 Act.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{changes were made}} to the {{intended}} route as work progressed, and the most significant was the change from a pier at Portbury to a dock at Portishead. The pier would have been exposed to westerly winds and would have had limited accommodation for the reception and loading of vessels. The intended Portishead branch became the main line, curving north at Portishead to service {{the west side of the}} new dock, and the Portbury section of the originally intended main line was abandoned; these changes were authorised in a new Act of 1866. Evidently the dock required more expenditure than the pier, and an <b>additional</b> £66,000 of <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> and £20,000 in loans were authorised.|$|R
