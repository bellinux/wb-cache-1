There are three main {{costs associated with}} content acquisition. First, SoundExchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves. These {{are by far the}} largest content <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as BMI, ASCAP, or SESAC in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays Rovi for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee.|$|E
25|$|That {{interchange}} {{marked a}} change in the parkway's design reflecting an evolution within the engineering community. Previously the parkway had been mostly undivided, with medians only in a few places where necessary. This, a practice of the WSPC, had helped save land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> But increasingly medians proved to be safer and more scenic. The segment between routes 52 and 82 at Arthursburg was the first designed as a fully divided parkway, with a continuous median. For the rest of the Taconic's construction, the roadways would come together only when necessary, at bridges and grade intersections.|$|E
25|$|The new Central High School {{building}} {{opened on}} September 1, 1893; designed by Furlong and Brown in the Victorian style, the facility cost $365,000, while land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> were $34,000. The building featured four stories, a curved facade, and a tower housing the school stairwells, {{and it had}} a capacity of 1,200 students. A notable event in Central's history occurred when, in 1922, William J. S. Bryan retired after having taught for 50 years in the school. During this period, several other high schools opened in St. Louis to alleviate overcrowding at Central, including McKinley High School and Yeatman High School in 1904, followed by Soldan High School in 1909, Cleveland High School in 1915, Roosevelt High School in 1925 and Beaumont High School in 1926.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, many American {{military}} personnel, {{who fell}} in love with the city while leaving for or returning from the Pacific, settled in the city, prompting the creation of the Sunset District, Visitacion Valley, and the total build out of San Francisco. During this period, Caltrans commenced an aggressive freeway construction program in the Bay Area. However, Caltrans soon encountered strong resistance in San Francisco, for the city's high population density meant that virtually any right-of-way would displace a large number of people. Caltrans tried to minimize displacement (and its land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs)</b> by building double-decker freeways, but the crude state of civil engineering at that time resulted in construction of some embarrassingly ugly freeways which ultimately turned out to be seismically unsafe. In 1959, the Board of Supervisors voted to halt construction of any more freeways in the city, an event known as the Freeway Revolt. Although some minor modifications have been allowed to the ends of existing freeways, the city's anti-freeway policy has remained in place ever since.|$|E

These smaller, second-hand aircraft's lower <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> (compared with the competition's bigger and newer 737-200s) enabled BIA to offer tour operators lower capacity aircraft at keener rates, giving it a competitive advantage on less dense routes. The One-Eleven 400's ability to match the 737-200's range, as well as both One-Eleven variants' ability to match the 737's fuel consumption and to comply with stricter, post-1985 noise abatement rules (as a result of having hush kits fitted to their engines), further enhanced BIA's competitiveness vis-à-vis its rivals. This helped attract business from the big tour operators that owned its rivals, especially to secondary European ski destinations served in winter where the lower trip costs of BIA's older planes outweighed the seat-mile cost advantage of the in-house airlines' technologically more advanced equipment. This in turn helped minimise the tour operators' risk, thereby representing a 'win-win' situation for both parties.|$|E

Cost overruns due to higher-than-estimated land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> caused delays as the project was revised to save money.

Our model suggests that for firms which receive favorable private information from investors prior to the issue, both the value of private information and the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> should affect the discount level. However, for firms receiving unfavorable information, only the information <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> should be the driving force of the discount level.
