5|$|Wartime interruptions in {{the supply}} of gas for heating {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} all the zoo's tropical fish and several other animals, including a lioness called Pearl and her litter of cubs. Although Manchester was heavily bombed during the Blitz, the gardens sustained only minor damage. The Scenic Railway was hit by an incendiary bomb and the Reptile House was damaged by shell splinters from <b>ack-ack</b> guns, which also caused the death of a bull bison.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Horne {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on a {{part-time}} training scheme. He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer in No. 911 (County of Warwick) Squadron, a barrage balloon unit in Sutton Coldfield, and was called up into the RAF full-time on the outbreak of war. In the initial months of the conflict—the Phoney War—Horne's duties were undemanding, and he formed a concert party from his friends and colleagues. In November 1940 {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant, and to squadron leader a year later. In early 1942, the BBC producer Bill McLurg asked whether the RAF station at which Horne was based could put on an edition of his programme <b>Ack-Ack,</b> Beer-Beer. Horne was ordered to put on the show, and he made his broadcasting debut on 16 April 1942, as the compere. Although the standard of the talent on the show was not high, McLurg was impressed with Horne's presentation, especially the way he hosted the programme's quiz; he invited Horne to be the programme's regular quizmaster, a role the latter fulfilled on over fifty <b>Ack-Ack,</b> Beer-Beer quizzes over the next two years. In January 1943 {{he became one of the}} show's regular comperes and presented the entire show for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had a burgeoning {{business}} career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show <b>Ack-Ack,</b> Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E
25|$|PAF {{fighter pilots}} {{were sent to}} West Pakistan via Burma on 8 December and 9 December {{when it became clear}} at least 36 hours of {{uninterrupted}} work was needed to fix the runways and the <b>ack-ack</b> units were unable to keep the IAF away. Pakistani authorities claimed that between 4–15 December the IAF lost 22 to 24 aircraft (7 to the PAF and the rest to <b>ack-ack</b> units). The IAF records 19 aircraft lost in East Pakistan, 3 in air combat, 6 to accidents and the rest to <b>ack-ack,</b> while 5 Sabres were shot down by IAF planes. After the liberation of Dhaka, 13 airframes were found at the Tejgaon airport by the Mitro Bahini in various states of sabotage. 2 T-33 trainers were inoperable, but 8 Sabres were made operational later. 5 of these frames were incorporated in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1972. Pakistan Armed Forces Headquarters had issued orders to blow up the aircraft, but Air Commodore Enam had pointed out that the sight of burning planes would demoralize the Pakistani troops defending Dacca. Therefore, PAF personnel destroyed the ammunition stocks and sabotaged the electric and hydraulic systems of the aircraft on 15 December.|$|E
25|$|Verne Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery is a World War II {{anti-aircraft}} battery, {{also known}} as an <b>ack-ack</b> battery, on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. The battery is situated on the north-east side of the island, south of the Verne Citadel and Verne High Angle Battery. Today the battery remains private property, owned by Fancy's Family Farm. Although a number of similar batteries were built {{around the same time}} on Portland, this particular battery is the only surviving one of its type on the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Dhaka {{witnessed}} thrilling low-level dogfights throughout 4 and 5 December. The IAF concentrated in attacking aircraft on the ground. However, for the dear price paid, {{it failed to}} cause significant damage to the PAF assets in well-dispersed and camouflaged locations. IAF also flew ground support missions, and the lessening pressure meant that the PAF managed to fly some ground support missions over Comilla and other areas. In total 20 operational sorties were flown by the Sabres, and 12,000 rounds of ammunition were used up during 5 December by the PAF. By the evening of 5 December, the IAF realized that a change of tactics was necessary. The <b>ack-ack</b> regiment managed to successfully defend the airbase during 5 December and {{the night of the}} early hours of the 6th against Indian attacks.|$|E
25|$|Drafted in March 1940, Denis McLoughlin {{served with}} the Royal Artillery's 101st Light Anti-Aircraft (<b>Ack-Ack)</b> and Anti-Tank Regiment (later the 1st Armoured Brigade). He managed to {{practice}} his art by painting a rhino insignia on the regiment's vehicles and by painting at least 37 murals of different sizes in various military buildings. His unofficial position of regimental painter gained Denis much greater freedom than the common soldier and allowed him several opportunities to practice his art. In the beginning, he painted officer's portraits for 5/- each. Soon, however, a London publisher, Wells Gardner, Darton & Co., offered him work painting book covers {{at the rate of}} £5 each. The first of these covers was for Frank Gruber's Navy Colt which appeared in 1943. Other covers followed for Wells Gardner, Darton & Co. which eventually recommended McLoughlin to Boardman Books. Having no work, however, Boardman passed Denis on to Australian owned Kangaroo Books.|$|E
25|$|Few fighter {{aircraft}} {{were able}} to operate at night. Ground-based radar was limited, airborne radar and RAF night fighters were generally ineffective. RAF day fighters were converting to night operations and the interim Bristol Blenheim night fighter conversion of the light bomber was being replaced by the powerful Beaufighter, but this was only available in very small numbers. By the second month of the Blitz the defences were not performing well. London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command. The difference this made {{to the effectiveness of}} air defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or <b>ack-ack)</b> in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.|$|E
500|$|Enola Gay stayed {{over the}} target area {{for two minutes}} and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew {{of the nature of}} the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a {{blinding}} flash and given black goggles. [...] "It was hard to believe what we saw", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said [...] "the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'". He and Tibbets compared the shockwave to [...] "a close burst of <b>ack-ack</b> fire".|$|E
500|$|<b>Ack-Ack,</b> Beer-Beer {{came to an}} end in February 1944 {{when the}} BBC decided to direct their {{programming}} at the general armed forces, rather than the barrage balloon crews. A month later Horne and Murdoch had expanded the idea of the remote and fictitious Royal Air Force station, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. The pair took the idea to the BBC producer Leslie Bridgemont who was responsible for the show Merry-go-Round, which featured, in weekly rotation, shows based on the Army, Navy and RAF. Bridgemont included a Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh section in Merry-go-Round on 31 March 1944; Horne played [...] "an officer so dim that even the other officers noticed", with Murdoch as his harassed second-in-command and Sam Costa as an [...] "amiable chump who always got things wrong".|$|E
500|$|In March 1943 Horne {{was posted}} to the Air Ministry in London, with {{the rank of}} wing commander. Continuing to {{broadcast}} on <b>Ack-Ack,</b> Beer-Beer, he also began to write sketches for the programme, and make broadcasts on other shows, including the Overseas Recorded Broadcasting Service (ORBS), to be transmitted to British forces in the Middle East. His work with ORBS brought him into contact with Flight Lieutenant Richard Murdoch, who he jokingly introduced in one broadcast as [...] "the station commander of Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh"; {{with a great deal}} in common in their backgrounds and a similar sense of humour, the pair quickly formed a friendship. Horne informed Murdoch of a squadron leader vacancy in his section at the Ministry, and Murdoch became his colleague. Murdoch, a professional actor and entertainer for 12 years before the war, recognised Horne's talent as a performer, and used his contacts to secure him more broadcasting work.|$|E
2500|$|Pakistan {{deployed}} {{no additional}} air defense assets other than one light antiaircraft [...] "Ack-Ack" [...] regiment {{and a few}} additional batteries to assist the PAF in 1971. The 6th Light <b>Ack-Ack</b> guarded Dhaka, the 46th Light <b>Ack-Ack</b> battery was in Chittagong, and elements of the 43rd <b>Ack-Ack</b> were present in areas around East Pakistan. The caliber of the regiment was not enhanced to heavy, and no surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) were deployed in East Pakistan. The only long-range radar, a Russian P-35 model, was also taken to West Pakistan, {{along with all the}} C-130 Hercules transport planes. Several dummies were deployed at the airbases to deceive the IAF, however. To augment short range radar cover, which could provide only 3–5 minutes warning to the planes, observers were deployed around the country, armed with radios and telephones. These were exposed to Mukti Bahini attacks, however, which tended to reduce their effectiveness. The IAF had flown reconnaissance flights over East Pakistan since June 1971, and had engaged their opponents earlier in the east than they did in the west, having clashed with PAF over the Salient of Boyra in West Bengal on 22 November. Between then and 3 December 1971, there were no engagements of the two air forces. Pakistan had lost 3 planes (2 shot down and 1 damaged) on 22 November over Boyra, and as no replacement aircraft had been sent from West Pakistan, were down to 16 operational Sabres by December 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Canberra bombers struck Tejgaon {{repeatedly}} on {{the night}} of 3 December.
