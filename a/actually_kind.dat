25|$|To counter Katherina's shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends {{that any}} harsh things she says or does are <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> and gentle. Katherina agrees to marry Petruchio after seeing {{he is the}} only man willing to counter her quick remarks; however, at the {{ceremony}} Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene when he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine. After the wedding, Petruchio takes Katherina to his home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than Lucentio actually possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio (i.e. Lucentio) can marry, Tranio decides they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father. Meanwhile, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attentions, thus removing Lucentio's remaining rival.|$|E
500|$|One critic theorized, [...] "...ather than {{end this}} Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the {{equivalent}} of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, {{just to see if}} the audience is paying attention." [...] Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, [...] "It's <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true."*Vest. pg. 135 While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.|$|E

500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to have us separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways." [...] Character Dr. Paul Farraday was named after English scientist, Michael Faraday, maybe.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E
500|$|Brissey's lowest grade, a [...] "B−", went to [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". Though {{she enjoyed}} the a cappella cover, Brissey found it incongruous in context, opining that Glee best {{performances}} are those {{linked to the}} storylines, allowing viewers to invest in their message. Several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying the song itself, including Mullins, Futterman and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson. Tucker felt that it had [...] "more snap and vigour" [...] than the final number, but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion, writing that it impacted negatively on the episode's momentum. Fallon gave the track an entirely positive review, suggesting {{that it should have}} been the episode's opening number and lauding it as [...] "surprising, oozing with charm, and <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of joyous." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France embraced the [...] "completely random and bizarre" [...] song choice, writing that it reminded her of the first season, [...] "when [...] never knew what to expect and [...] was often happily surprised." [...] Reiter too reviewed it favorably, calling it the best performance of the show. She appreciated the focus on facial expressions during the performance, in contrast to the elaborate costuming which she felt distracted from other numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Film {{historian}} Leonard Maltin was <b>actually</b> <b>kinder</b> to the remake, {{giving it}} 2 {{out of a}} possible 4 stars (he declared its 1981 predecessor a bomb). Yet he also said it was [...] "Mediocre...This is sure to connect with its target audience - and it's Oscar-worthy compared to the 1981 version - but it remains overwrought and pointless for fans of the novel. Moreover, Lionel Richie's smash-hit title song (the only memorable thing about the first film) is sorely missed here." ...|$|R

500|$|Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News {{felt that}} Keys [...] "croons" [...] on the track's chorus line, [...] "I'm from Neeeeww Yooooork/These streets {{will make you}} feel brand-new/Bright lights will inspire you." [...] Keys said that while {{recording}} the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, [...] "I did try it a couple of times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the first time, I was <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Star {{described}} the Codeine's music as slowcore, a style AllMusic stated {{was famous for}} having a slow pace and skeletal music with [...] "melodies linger forever and rhythms lurch forward, all shrouded in thick, dank atmospherics." [...] Stewart Mason of AllMusic {{described the}} music of Barely Real as {{a continuation of the}} style made on their previous album", while comparing a review of the compilation album When I See The Sun in Exclaim! proposed that the group's music [...] "didn't change much during their five years together ― all the songs are relentlessly slow and possess an emotional detachment verging on apathy." [...] When asked about the music's pace, on Barely Real, Immerwahr said the music was in contrast to grunge music of the era, and that slowing it down made it [...] "challenging for people and challenging for audiences. And I <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of like that." [...] In a contemporary review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated this style is exemplified on songs like [...] "Realize", which continued the hybrid of a deliberate pace with electric guitar playing with softly sung vocals. Some tracks contained a variation on Codeine's music, such as [...] "Promise of Love", which Raggett characterized as having a [...] "late-night jazz club style" [...] that only contains more traditional Codeine styled music towards the end. Other songs that veried the sound included the piano-based track [...] "W." [...] performed by David Grubbs and quick stuttering guitar riff on [...] "Jr". Immerwhar spoke about the tracks [...] "W." [...] and [...] "Promise of Love", [...] opining that [...] "W." [...] created a [...] "nice transition from the severity of 'Hard to Find' to the jazzy 'Promise of Love'" ...|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. Therefore, the U.S. financial services industry has lobbied since the mid-19th century for faster foreclosure procedures that would not clog up state courts with uncontested cases, and would lower the cost of credit (because it must always have the cost of recovering collateral built-in). Lenders have also argued that taking foreclosures out of the courts is <b>actually</b> <b>kinder</b> and less traumatic to defaulting borrowers, as it avoids the in terrorem effects of being sued.|$|R
2500|$|In a March 2010 MTV {{interview}} {{about the new}} album, Way explained, [...] "There's no title yet...I'm <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of excited about that.

[...] Though the band since decided on the title of their fourth album, it continued to go unannounced, with various rumors circulating and the band stating on their website {{that it will be}} revealed [...] "all in due time" [...] and in Way's words, [...] "a special way this time.

2500|$|The band's debut album, Generation Terrorists, was {{released}} in 1992 on the Columbia Records imprint. The liner notes contained a literary quote {{for each of the}} album's eighteen songs and the album lasted just over seventy minutes. The album's lyrics are politicised like those of the Clash and Public Enemy, with the album's songs regularly switching from a critical focus on global capitalism to more personal tales of despair and the struggles of youth. About the musical style of the album Pitchfork writer Joe Tangari wrote that Generation Terrorists [...] "walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so obviously patterned after the Clash's London Calling that it was <b>actually</b> <b>kind</b> of cute." ...|$|E
