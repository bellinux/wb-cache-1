5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops {{due to her}} mobile phone ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him {{that she needs to}} do some things before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing.

During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress.|$|E
5|$|Emily, {{disguised}} as her twin sister Katie, arrives at college to take Katie's history exam. In reality, Katie is at home, with nine stitches {{to the head}} after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. Katie is embarrassed <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> injuries look, and miserable {{over the loss of}} her boyfriend Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise (which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), who offers her his shoes and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob (John Bishop), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna (Ronni Ancona), is speechless, while Katie tries to deny it. She and Emily have a heated argument, leaving Katie crying.|$|E

5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E
25|$|Although scandalized by Don Ciccio's stories, the Prince at last {{asks the}} {{question}} that's really on his mind—what is Angelica truly like? Ciccio speaks rapturously of her beauty, poise, and sophistication, and then speaks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> parents' vulgarity {{seems to have}} not affected her. The Prince bristles, and informs Don Ciccio that from now on, because Angelica and Tancredi are to be married, the Serdàras must be spoken about with appropriate respect. Ciccio, who has believed that Tancredi was attempting to seduce Angelica in order to embarrass her father, is horrified. He bursts out that for Tancredi and Angelica to marry will cause {{the end of the}} good qualities of the Salina and Falconieri families. The Prince thinks to himself, however, that the marriage will not be the end, but the beginning. As the Prince and Don Ciccio return to Donnafugata, it is impossible to tell which of them is Don Quixote and which is Sancho Panza.|$|E

She had one younger brother, Mark. Her father was a schoolteacher and dedicated socialist, whom she credited with inspiring her passion for social justice.

However, she contrasts this with her commitment to music and No Doubt. Stefani describes her relationship as unhealthy because of this disparity, comparing herself to [...] "a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight." [...] She ultimately decides that settling down is just a fantasy for her since her freedom and independence is more important for her.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{lines of}} [...] "XO" [...] are echo-laden and in {{contrast}} to other songs on Beyoncé, the ballad contains several hooks. Beyoncé starts the song by asking a loved one to kiss her. Some of the ascending chorus lines are call and response; Beyoncé is backed by a sing-along crowd as she sings <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> [...] "darkest nights" [...] are enlightened by the lover's face: [...] "In the darkest night hour / I search through the crowd / Your face is all that I see / I give you everything".

[...] She said {{that she wanted to}} make the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never set out to make music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic.

500|$|Beahan {{had been}} {{thinking}} of releasing a tribute record through his company for a long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute came to me in a dream last fall, and I immediately started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E
