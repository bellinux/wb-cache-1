50|$|<b>Anti{{estrogen}}s,</b> {{also known}} as estrogen antagonists or estrogen blockers, are a class of drugs which prevent estrogens like estradiol from mediating their biological effects in the body.

40|$|AbstractNon-steroidal <b>antiestrogens</b> such as {{tamoxifen}} {{are known}} to exert cytotoxic effects against various cell lines in culture. When the <b>antiestrogens</b> are present at sufficiently high concentrations, their cytotoxicity cannot be reversed by estrogens and is demonstrable even with cell lines which lack the estrogen receptor. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity, which is clearly independent of estrogen antagonism, remains unknown. Using two murine cancer cell lines (the K 36 leukemia and the EL 4 lymphoma cell line), the human breast cancer cell line MCF 7, and two non-steroidal <b>antiestrogens</b> (tamoxifen and clomiphene), our laboratory attempted {{to determine whether the}} cytotoxic action of non-steroidal <b>antiestrogens</b> was mediated by a mechanism requiring protein or RNA synthesis. In the case of K 36 and EL 4 cells, inclusion of tamoxifen or clomiphene in the culture medium regularly caused the viable call count to fall below 20 – 30 % of control in 36 – 48 h. Under these conditions, the addition of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis consistently increased viable cell count in a dose-dependent manner. With cultures of K 36 cells grown in the presence of 10 μM tamoxifen, for example the addition of appropriate concentrations of emetine, cycloheximide, puromycin, or actinomycin D increased the percentage of viable cells to 5. 0, 2. 4, 4. 0, and 4. 0 times that of control, respectively. Additional experiments revealed that the macromolecular synthesis inhibitors, while effective in inhibiting protein or RNA synthesis to varying degrees, did not affect the cellular uptake of [3 H]tamoxifen, suggesting that their ability to protect cells against antiestrogen-induced cell death was not due to an inhibition of cellular uptake of <b>antiestrogens.</b> In the case of MCF 7 cells, however, inhibition of protein synthesis did not protect the cells against the cytotoxic effect of tamoxifen. These observations suggest that non-steroidal <b>antiestrogens</b> may exert their cytotoxic effect by at least two different mechanisms; only one of these require de novo protein synthesis. The effect of <b>antiestrogens</b> on K 36 and EL 4 cells may provide a useful system for the identification of proteins involved in cell death...|$|R

40|$|This study {{questioned}} whether the mechanisms of resistance to <b>antiestrogens</b> differ when acquired under premenopausal (Pre-M) vs. postmenopausal (PM) conditions and whether structurally diverse <b>antiestrogens</b> induce adaptation of differing signaling pathways. To address this issue, we conducted systematic studies under Pre-M vs. PM culture conditions with long-term exposure to different <b>antiestrogens</b> and examined the resultant “specific biologic signatures” of the various resistant cells. Estradiol stimulated growth and inhibited apoptosis of “pre-menopausal” antiestrogen-resistant cells but exerted opposite effects on their “post-menopausal” counterparts. Under Pre-M conditions, tamoxifen (TAM) -resistant cells exhibited a marked translocation of estrogen receptor α from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, whereas this occurred {{to a lesser extent}} under PM conditions. MCF- 7 cells exposed to PM but not Pre-M conditions exhibited up-regulation of basal epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) levels, an effect exaggerated in cells exposed to 4 -hydroxytamoxifen. Differing effects occurred in response to structurally divergent <b>antiestrogens.</b> Long-term treatment with both 4 -hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182, 780 increased EGFR levels, but this was not seen in response to TAM. Surprisingly, EGF administration slightly increased cell number in TAM-resistant cells, whereas only increasing cell weight and decreasing cell number in EGFR overexpressing-resistant cells. To assess potential differences among various parental cell lines, we induced resistance in cell lines obtained from other laboratories and confirmed the results from our own parental cells with minor differences. Together, these data demonstrate that culture of breast cancer cells under Pre-M and PM conditions and structurally diverse <b>antiestrogens</b> results in adaptive responses with differing biological signatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{action of}} nuclear hormone receptors is tripartite, {{involving}} the receptor, its ligands, and its coregulator proteins. The estrogen receptor (ER), {{a member of}} this superfamily, is a hormone-activated transcription factor that mediates the stimulatory effects of estrogens and the inhibitory effects of <b>antiestrogens</b> such as tamoxifen in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. To understand how <b>antiestrogens</b> and dominant negative ERs suppress ER activity, we used a dominant negative ER as bait in two-hybrid screening assays from which we isolated a clone from breast cancer cells that potentiates the inhibitory activities of dominant negative ERs and antiestrogen-liganded ER. At higher concentrations, it also represses the transcriptional activity of the estradiol-liganded ER, while having no effect on other nuclear hormone receptors. This clone, denoted REA for “repressor of estrogen receptor activity,” encodes a 37 -kDa protein that is an ER-selective coregulator. Its competitive reversal of steroid receptor coactivator 1 enhancement of ER activity and its direct interaction with liganded ER suggest that it may {{play an important role in}} determining the sensitivity of estrogen target cells, including breast cancer cells, to <b>antiestrogens</b> and estrogens...|$|R
