5000|$|Aviation and {{logistics}} {{is an important}} sector of Dubai's economy, Emirates Airlines and Dubai Aiports Company account for 26% of the country's GDP (2011). Dubai has an [...] "open skies" [...] policy that allows any airlines to open service there. Its open skies policy was heavily criticized in a campaign called American for fair skies led by US airlines and labor groups. The campaign asked president Barack Obama to solve this case of unfair competition, revealing that <b>airport-related</b> <b>activities</b> in Dubai are heavily subsidized.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the application of remote sensor technology to operational aviation and <b>airport-related</b> <b>activities</b> such as Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS). Radio Acoustic Sounding Systems (RASS), Doppler-acoustic sodars, Ultrahigh Frequencies (UHF) profilers and lidars have many advantages in measuring wind and temperature profiles in the lower atmospheric boundary layer since they can operate more or less continuously and unattended; however, there are limitations in their operational use at airports. For example, profilers deteriorate (limited altitude coverage or missing) in moderate or greater rain and can be affected by airplane targets in their field of view. Sodars can handle precipitation better but are affected by the high noise environments of airports and strong winds. Morning temperature inversions typically limit performance of RASS, sodars and profilers. Fog affects sonic anemometers. Lidars can have difficulties in clouds, fog or heavy precipitation. Despite their limitations these sensors have proven useful to provide wind and temperature profiles for AVOSS. Capabilities and limitations of these and other sensors used in the AVOSS program are discussed, parameter settings for the sensor systems are documented, and recommendations are made for the most cost-effective group of sensors for the future. The potential use of specially tuned dynamic forecast models and measurements from landing and departing aircraft are addressed...|$|E
