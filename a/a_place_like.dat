A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in <b>a</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> This? (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E
25|$|The manorial records offer a good {{opportunity}} to study the geographical distribution of the plague. Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England, though <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> East Anglia, which had frequent contact with the Continent, was severely affected. On a local level, however, there were great variations. A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population. The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality, since the rolls only record the heads of households, normally an adult male. Here the IPMs show us that the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly.|$|E

25|$|Mahavira: I shall {{describe}} the truly insupportable pains {{where there is}} distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings {{for the sake of}} his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run.

25|$|Emma, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Mr. Gold, and Hook {{arrive in}} Neverland via the portal from the magic bean. Gold admonishes Emma {{for not having}} enough belief, which is {{essential}} to have in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Neverland, and leaves the party to search for Henry on the island himself. Emma holds Mary Margaret and David accountable for what has happened, believing that she should never have broken the curse and simply left Storybrooke with Henry. Hook commiserates with her {{over the loss of}} Neal, but their mourning is interrupted by an attack on the Jolly Roger by mermaids. Mary Margaret and Emma catch one in a net, while Regina drives the others away with fire. The makeshift crew argues among themselves {{about what to do with}} the mermaid, who summons a storm with a conch shell. The storm continues to worsen, and Regina turns the mermaid into a wooden statue. Further arguing makes Mary Margaret finally release her years of rage against Regina and the two begin assaulting each other, prompting David to attempt to break it up and get drawn into a brawl with Hook. Emma realizes that their strife is causing the storm, echoing the mermaid's warning that they would kill themselves. In order to force them to cooperate, she dives overboard and is struck by a pulley that has fallen from the ship's rigging. The plan works as everyone puts aside their differences to help David get into the water to rescue her. The storm clears up and the Jolly Roger is able to approach the island. Despite Hook's earlier plan of making their way around the island and catching the Lost Boys by surprise, Emma elects to lead the crew on a direct assault route, declaring that they must believe in each other in order for them to succeed in Neverland.|$|E
500|$|The celebratory mood {{continued}} into the next preseason, when Adams sent the team for two weeks of training camp in Hawaii. Rymkus was upset by the distractions caused by the decision. [...] "We {{found it hard to}} think football around the palm trees", he said. [...] "A preseason camp has to be hard, and you have to work hard. You can't do it in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Hawaii." [...] The team got off to a 1–3–1 start in 1961, and Adams fired him on October 14. Adams said the decision was [...] "based on the conclusion the material on hand has not been used to its fullest potential". Wally Lemm was given the head coaching job, but the shake-up prompted Speedie to resign. Under Lemm, the Oilers regrouped to win their second consecutive title.|$|E

500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. [...] I got rolled in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this once." [...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Music began in January 2000 at Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. The first song that Madonna and Ahmadzaï worked on was [...] "Impressive Instant", {{since it was}} the most complete among all the demos that he had sent to the singer. The song was an instrumental and was not supposed to be included in Ahmadzaï's own album, Production. But Madonna had different ideas for the track and its lyrics, which she explained to the producer. Feeling that Madonna's vision about the song's composition would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there on his own computer. [...] "There are a lot of chopped vocal tracks on 'Impressive Instant'...That was impossible to do in the studio. It doesn't make sense to rent <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Sarm just to have me work on ten seconds of music all day, using only the one computer," [...] he added. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals, acoustic guitars etc. on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of the TC Electronic Finalizer; Ahmadzaï then went back to Paris with the recordings.|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dead Celebrities" [...] makes {{frequent}} {{mention of}} the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> McDonald's or Taco Bell. Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense, which stars Haley Joel Osment {{as a young boy}} who can see ghosts. Ike's line, [...] "I see dead celebrities", is a reference to that film's most famous line, [...] "I see dead people." [...] The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film, Poltergeist. Another film reference is made to The Exorcist when the medium is flung from the window. [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] also mocks the Syfy reality television series Ghost Hunters by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only to be frightened and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of stage mothers to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller, also of TV Squad, {{called it}} one of the best episodes of the season, and that it {{provided}} each member of the ensemble cast moments to shine. He praised how the episode combined the [...] "funny small-townness of <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Pawnee and the realities of being in city government". James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it a [...] "splendid" [...] episode that [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". Punchline Magazine writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured [...] "plenty of laugh-out-loud moments" [...] and particularly enjoyed the [...] "sweet non-aggressive fighting" [...] between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties that plague the harvest festival were funny, [...] "but like the best of Parks, these hiccups are matched with acres of heart". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series [...] "one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot [...] "wildly politically incorrect, but funny". National Post writer Scott Stinson said Parks and Recreation [...] "continues to challenge for the title of best comedy on television", and called the continuing romance between April and Andy a [...] "welcome development" [...] for both characters.|$|E
