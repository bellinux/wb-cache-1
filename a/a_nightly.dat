5|$|Most of {{the care}} for a young bat comes from the mother. However, in monogamous species, the father plays a role. In addition, allo-suckling, where a female suckles young that is not hers, occurs in several species. This may serve to {{increase}} colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides {{with the development of}} an adult body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is likely due to the species' blood-based diet which is difficult to obtain on <b>a</b> <b>nightly</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to <b>a</b> <b>nightly</b> schedule, Monday through Friday.

Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains {{a part of the}} show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than from any other state.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando would be reviving Double Dare as <b>a</b> <b>nightly</b> live stage presentation, Double Dare Live.

5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into <b>a</b> <b>nightly</b> state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was <b>a</b> <b>nightly</b> sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E
