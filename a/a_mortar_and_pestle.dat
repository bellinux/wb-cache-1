5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle,</b> reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
25|$|Coffee beans may {{be ground}} in several ways. A burr grinder uses {{revolving}} elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.|$|E

The preparation of this paste includes shrimp paste and shallots and all the ingredients are pounded with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b> This paste can be made from dry red chilies and one made from fresh red chilies. Some recipes state that large chilies should be used, others prefer bird's eye chilies.|$|E

William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what {{is still one of}} the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns.|$|E
500|$|Bara brith is a fruit loaf {{originating}} from rural Wales, where they used <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> to grind the fresh sweet spices. Historically {{it was made}} with yeast and butter, though recently {{it is likely to}} be made with bicarbonate of soda and margarine. The fruit included would be dried raisins, currants and candied peel, which would be soaked in cold tea before cooking. Generally served sliced with butter during afternoon tea, it is often known as Welsh tea bread. Bara Brith translates to [...] "speckled bread", but it is also known as teisen dorth in South Wales, where sultanas are included in the recipe, or as torta negra when Welsh settlers brought it to Argentina.|$|E
2500|$|Poppy seeds can {{be ground}} using a generic tool such as <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> {{or a small}} {{domestic}} type electric blade grinder, or a special purpose poppy seed grinder.

2500|$|Calixarenes are {{difficult}} to produce because random polymerization occurs inside of complex mixtures of linear and cyclic oligomers with different numbers of repeating units. With finely tuned starting materials and reaction conditions, synthesis can also be surprisingly facile. In 2005, researchers produced pyrogallolarene simply by mixing a solvent-free dispersion of isovaleraldehyde with pyrogallol, and a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid, in <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b> Calixarenes are sparingly soluble as parent compounds and [...] melt at high temperatures compared to other crystalline solids.|$|E

[...] Vibration during transportation could cause the components to separate again, requiring remixing in the field. Also if {{the quality of the}} saltpeter was low (for instance if it was contaminated with highly hygroscopic calcium nitrate), or if the powder was simply old (due to the mildly hygroscopic nature of potassium nitrate), in humid weather it would need to be re-dried. The dust from [...] "repairing" [...] powder in the field was a major hazard.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Seminole {{culture that}} took shape after 1800 was a dynamic mixture of African, Native American, Spanish, and slave traditions. Adopting certain {{practices}} of the Native Americans, [...] maroons wore Seminole clothing and ate the same foodstuffs prepared the same way: they gathered the roots of a native plant called coontie, grinding, soaking, and straining {{them to make a}} starchy flour similar to arrowroot, as well as mashing corn with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> to make sofkee, a sort of porridge often used as a beverage, with water added— ashes from the fire wood used to cook the sofkee were occasionally added to it for extra flavor. They also introduced their Gullah staple of rice to the Seminole, and continued {{to use it as a}} basic part of their diets. Rice remained part of the diet of the Black Seminoles who moved to Oklahoma.|$|E

2500|$|Fifteenth Day of the Eighth Moon; this festival (today simply {{called the}} Moon Festival or Mid-Autumn Festival), {{took place in}} mid autumn, and was {{designated}} as a three-day vacation for government officials. Unlike the previous holiday's association with Buddhism, this holiday was associated with Taoism, specifically Taoist alchemy.

He memorized the music, and on his return to earth taught it to his performers. For people in Chang'an (and elsewhere), this holiday was a means for many to simply feast and drink for the night.|$|E
60|$|But, {{under the}} housewifery of Proserpina, {{since we are}} to call the juice of fruit, Nectar, its {{substance}} will be as naturally and easily called Ambrosia; and I {{have no doubt that}} this, with the other names defined in this chapter, will not only be found practically more convenient than the phrases in common use, but will more securely fix in the student's mind a true conception of {231} the essential differences in substance, which, ultimately, depend wholly on their pleasantness to human perception, and offices for human good; and not at all on any otherwise explicable structure or faculty. It is of no use to determine, by microscope or retort, that cinnamon is made of cells with so many walls, or grape-juice of molecules with so many sides;--we are just as far as ever from understanding why these particular interstices should be aromatic, and these special parallelopipeds exhilarating, as we were in the savagely unscientific days when we could only see with our eyes, and smell with our noses. But to call each of these separate substances by a name rightly belonging to it through all the past variations of the language of educated man, will probably enable us often to discern powers in the thing itself, of affecting the human body and mind, which are indeed qualities infinitely more its own, than any which can possibly be extracted by the point of a knife, or brayed out with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b>|$|E
60|$|In a dentist's {{operating}} room on a fine August morning in 1896. Not the usual tiny London den, {{but the best}} sitting room of a furnished lodging in a terrace on the sea front at a fashionable watering place. The operating chair, with a gas pump and cylinder beside it, is half way between {{the centre of the}} room and one of the corners. If you look into the room through the window which lights it, you will see the fireplace {{in the middle of the}} wall opposite you, with the door beside it to your left; an M.R.C.S. diploma in a frame hung on the chimneypiece; an easy chair covered in black leather on the hearth; a neat stool and bench, with vice, tools, and <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> in the corner to the right. Near this bench stands a slender machine like a whip provided with a stand, a pedal, and an exaggerated winch. Recognising this as a dental drill, you shudder and look away to your left, where you can see another window, underneath which stands a writing table, with a blotter and a diary on it, and a chair. Next the writing table, towards the door, is a leather covered sofa. The opposite wall, close on your right, is occupied mostly by a bookcase. The operating chair is under your nose, facing you, with the cabinet of instruments handy to it on your left. You observe that the professional furniture and apparatus are new, and that the wall paper, designed, with the taste of an undertaker, in festoons and urns, the carpet with its symmetrical plans of rich, cabbagy nosegays, the glass gasalier with lustres; the ornamental gilt rimmed blue candlesticks on the ends of the mantelshelf, also glass- draped with lustres, and the ormolu clock under a glass-cover in the middle between them, its uselessness emphasized by a cheap American clock disrespectfully placed beside it and now indicating 12 o'clock noon, all combine with the black marble which gives the fireplace the air of a miniature family vault, to suggest early Victorian commercial respectability, belief in money, Bible fetichism, fear of hell always at war with fear of poverty, instinctive horror of the passionate character of art, love and Roman Catholic religion, and all the first fruits of plutocracy in the early generations of the industrial revolution.|$|E
