5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> made many enemies.|$|E

Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.|$|E
25|$|The West Syrian Rite, used in Syria by the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites) and Catholic Syrians is in {{its origin}} simply the old rite of Antioch in the Syriac language.

25|$|Autonomous {{adaptation}} are adaptations {{that are}} reactive to climatic stimuli, and are done <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> without {{the intervention of}} a public agency. Planned adaptation can be reactive or anticipatory, i.e., undertaken before impacts are apparent. Some studies suggest that human systems have considerable capacity to adapt autonomously (Smit et al., 2001:890). Others point to constraints on autonomous adaptation, such as limited information and access to resources (p.890). Smit et al. (2001:904) concluded that relying on autonomous {{adaptation to climate change}} would result in substantial ecological, social, and economic costs. In their view, these costs could largely be avoided with planned adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) were persecuted {{and imprisoned}} by Russian forces <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> Most victims were {{deported}} to the gulags in the Donetsk region. In 1945 alone, {{the number of}} members of the Polish Underground State who were deported to Siberia and various labor camps in the Soviet Union reached 50,000. Units of the Red Army carried out campaigns against Polish partisans and civilians. During the Augustów chase in 1945, more than 2,000 Poles were captured and about 600 of them are presumed to have died in Soviet custody.

25|$|South Carolina {{no longer}} {{requires}} attorneys to be licensed separately to plead in a courtroom. Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys {{to obtain a}} separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.|$|E

There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God. (See Black people and priesthood (LDS)). The doctrine was eliminated in 1978 and the church now allows all men to hold the priesthood, subject to worthiness.|$|E
25|$|A {{smaller number}} is {{suggested}} by the results of the 2001 Census, in which a question about religious affiliation was asked for the first time. Respondents were able to write in an affiliation not covered by the checklist of common religions, and a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland and Wales declared themselves to be Pagans by this method. These figures were not released <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> by the Office for National Statistics, but were released after an application by the Pagan Federation of Scotland. This is more than many well known traditions such as Rastafarian, Bahá'í and Zoroastrian groups, but fewer than the big six of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism. It is also fewer than the adherents Jediism, whose campaign made them the fourth largest religion after Christianity, Islam and Hinduism.|$|E
