5|$|The Burys {{travelled}} {{north as}} second-class {{passengers on the}} steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee {{on the evening of}} 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} squat/Western toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped {{down over}} <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> toilet, and the toilet {{can be used}} essentially {{the same way as}} the Western style. This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> toilet into a Western-style washlet. Inversely, there also exists a conversion platform available, that allows someone who prefers <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> toilet to raise himself up to the level of a Western toilet.|$|E

Shayler has since told newspapers that his transvestite 'alter ego' is called Delores Kane.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of La Vieille {{was designed to}} be aesthetically pleasing, yet sufficiently distinct to minimise confusion with the nearby tower Tévennec. Its shape is <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> quadrilateral, with slight crenellations. The tower is square and semi-cylindrical on the north face, widening toward the base. The structure of the lighthouse was built in stone using bosses of grey granite quarried from the Île de Sein, while {{the upper part of the}} tower and corners were built from coated cinder blocks of blue kersantite.|$|E
25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the main wheels to gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the throttles to idle to reduce engine thrust. <b>A</b> <b>squat</b> switch in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} Japanese designs, {{it had a}} very low profile and was {{intended}} to be operated from <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner and open carriage-style legs which could be spread to improve the stability. The breech had a semi-automatic cartridge case ejection system to improve reloading time. When the shell was loaded, the rear of the cartridge case tripped a catch closing the breechblock. The recoil action of firing opened the breech and extracted the cartridge case.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific yew is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} evergreen tree, growing 10–15m tall and with a trunk up to 50cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of 20m occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in <b>a</b> <b>squat,</b> multiple leader form.|$|E
25|$|Skeletal muscle burns 90mg (0.5 mmol) of glucose each minute during {{continuous}} activity (such as when repetitively {{extending the}} human knee), generating ≈24 W of mechanical energy, and since muscle energy conversion is only 22–26% efficient, ≈76 W of heat energy. Resting skeletal muscle has a {{basal metabolic rate}} (resting energy consumption) of 0.63 W/kg making a 160 fold difference between the energy consumption of inactive and active muscles. For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate twice this amount in nonhuman animals such as bonobos, and in some small lizards.|$|E

25|$|Until 1858, {{the former}} parish church of St. Stephen {{stood at the}} {{location}} of the current building. The originally late Romanesque building from the 12thcentury was expanded {{at the beginning of the}} 14thcentury in the Gothic style. A substantially higher choir was added to the nave. In 1510, the Romanesque bell tower was remodelled in the style of the Renaissance. In 1707, the bell tower was crowned with an onion dome. In 1857, the city council of Mulhouse decided to replace the place of worship, which had come to be looked upon as dilapidated, by a new building. The city architect Schacre, who had already constructed the main synagogue of the city and the Catholic St.Stephen's Church, designed a church in the neo-Gothic style with a simple, rectangular ground plan without a transept and choir. In contrast to the long Catholic church, it was <b>a</b> <b>squat,</b> but very wide building. The bell tower, which is visible from quite a distance away, stands behind the building, in contrast to its model on the Freiburg Minster. The current church was built between 1859 and 1866. Since February 2009 and prospectively until late 2019, the church is subjected to a progressive restoration of all its exterior and interior parts. The work had started with the complete scaffolding of the steeple.|$|E
500|$|Three genetically {{distinct}} {{forms of}} B.brownii are recognised: the better known forms are a [...] "mountain form" [...] with a shrubby habit, short thin hard leaves, and <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> inflorescence; and a [...] "Millbrook Road form", with a tree habit and longer, wider, soft leaves. Some horticulturists also recognise an intermediate form. Recent genetic testing has confirmed {{the existence of}} three distinct forms, but currently these have no taxonomic status.|$|E

500|$|When it {{was built}} around 1218–20, the Zytglogge served as the gate tower of Bern's western fortifications. These were erected after the city's first westward {{expansion}} following its de facto independence from the Empire. At that time, the Zytglogge was <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> building of only [...] in height. When {{the rapid growth of}} the city and the further expansion of the fortifications (up to the Käfigturm) relegated the tower to second-line status at around 1270–75, it was heightened by [...] to overlook the surrounding houses.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Richard Thompson contributed two {{compositions}} to the album. The opening track, [...] "Genesis Hall", {{is a slow}} 3/4 waltz, {{on which}} he played dulcimer, while Sandy Denny provided the vocals; it was the B-Side of the single release. Genesis Hall was the nickname of the former Bell Hotel in Drury Lane, which had become <b>a</b> <b>squat</b> in early 1969 and later became noted for a mass eviction by the police. In the view of Mojo magazine reviewer Mike Baines [...] "Thompson's writing reached maturity on 'Genesis Hall'". [...] "Cajun Woman", which opens the second side of the album, features Dave Swarbrick's fiddle-playing in his first work with Fairport.|$|E
