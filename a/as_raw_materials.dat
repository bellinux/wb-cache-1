25|$|Porter {{developed}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the profitability of industries and how those profits are divided among the participants in 1980. In five forces analysis he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of substitute products, and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization's ability to raise its prices {{as well as the}} costs of inputs (such <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials)</b> for its processes.|$|E

25|$|The huge {{losses on}} the battlefields were {{not limited to}} men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> to be squandered {{for the purposes of the}} rich and powerful.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{created a}} system of colonial mercantilism, requiring construction of significant transportation infrastructure on the Korean Peninsula {{for the purpose of}} extracting and exploiting resources such <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> (timber), foodstuff (mostly rice and fish), and mineral resources (coal and iron ore). The Japanese developed port facilities and an extensive railway system which included a main trunk railway from the southern port city of Pusan through the capital of Seoul and north to the Chinese border. This infrastructure was intended not only to facilitate a colonial mercantilist economy, but was also viewed as a strategic necessity for the Japanese military to control Korea and to move large numbers of troops and materials to the Chinese border at short notice.|$|E
25|$|Key {{reasons of}} China's {{interest}} on Africa {{are to be}} found in China itself. Chinese economy, industry, energy and society have a special shape. Chinese economy and industry turn toward export markets. These industries and associated works and investment provide the Chinese society the recent two-digit yearly economic growth, job chances, and life standard improvement, but dramatically rely on coal (70%) and oil (25%) sources (for 2003), as well <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials.</b> Notable are the frequent electric shortages. A US Congress hearing noticed that energy shortages have already led to rationing of the electric supply, slowing down manufacturing sector and consequently overall economic growth. On other raw materials side, China simply does not have enough natural resources of its own to meet its growing industrial need.|$|E

25|$|A {{cement plant}} consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, {{depending}} on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, {{and to a lesser}} extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln (referred to as co-processing), replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, shale, and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.|$|E

2500|$|Energy {{production}} {{usually requires}} an energy investment. Drilling for oil or building a {{wind power plant}} requires energy. The fossil fuel resources that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert. They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments. If investment {{is greater than the}} value of the energy produced by the resource, it is no longer an effective energy source. [...] These resources are no longer an energy source but may be exploited for value <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials.</b> [...] New technology may lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorspar {{is another}} mineral {{sporadically}} co-present with Weardale Granite and became {{important in the}} manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take fluorspar from old excavation heaps. [...] Fluorspar explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the Wear valley, Consett and Teesside during the nineteenth century. [...] Overlying are three Carboniferous minerals: limestone, Coal Measures <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for iron and steel manufacture, and sandstone, useful as a refractory material. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality.

A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930 Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with the major European capitals. The Colón Theater became one of the world's top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of radio, television, cinema, and theatre. The city's main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America's then-tallest buildings and its first underground system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city.|$|E

2500|$|Middle Paleolithic societies, unlike Lower Paleolithic {{and early}} Neolithic ones, {{consisted}} of bands {{that ranged from}} 20–30 or 25–100 members and were usually nomadic. These bands were formed by several families. Bands sometimes joined together into larger [...] "macrobands" [...] for activities such as acquiring mates and celebrations or where resources were abundant. By {{the end of the}} Paleolithic era (BP), people began to settle down into permanent locations, and began to rely on agriculture for sustenance in many locations. Much evidence exists that humans took part in long-distance trade between bands for rare commodities (such as ochre, which was often used for religious purposes such as ritual) and raw materials, as early as 120,000 years ago in Middle Paleolithic. Inter-band trade may have appeared during the Middle Paleolithic because trade between bands would have helped ensure their survival by allowing them to exchange resources and commodities such <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> during times of relative scarcity (i.e. famine, drought). Like in modern hunter-gatherer societies, individuals in Paleolithic societies may have been subordinate to the band as a whole. Both Neanderthals and modern humans took care of the elderly members of their societies during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic.|$|E
2500|$|The annual Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival {{has been}} held since 1985. Although the {{official}} start date is 5 January each year, in practice, many of the sculptures can be seen before.

Ice and Snow World features illuminated full-size buildings made from blocks of 2–3 feet thick crystal clear ice directly taken from the Songhua River which passes through the city. The sculptures inside the exhibition ground takes 15,000 workers to work for 16 days. In early December, ice artisans cut 120,000 cubic metres (4.2 million cubic feet) of ice blocks from Songhua river's frozen surface <b>as</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for the ice sculptures' show. Massive ice buildings, large-scale snow sculptures, ice slides, festival food and drinks can also be found in several parks and major avenues in the city. Winter activities in the festival include Yabuli Alpine Skiing, snow mobile driving, winter-swimming in Songhua River, and the traditional ice-lantern exhibition in Zhaolin Garden, which was first held in 1963. Snow carving and ice and snow recreations are famous nationwide, especially among Asian countries including Korea, Japan, Thailand and Singapore.|$|E
