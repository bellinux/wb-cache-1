5|$|Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to Joe Lillard and Annie Johnson, Lillard was {{the first}} of the couple's two children; Johnson also had a son from a {{previous}} marriage. Lillard took up baseball at the age of six; his other childhood hobbies included singing <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> dancing.

5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E

In the 1780s {{he and his}} partner Thomas Forbes were granted thousands of acres of land west of present-day Palatka; here they used slave labor to build drainage canals and dikes for a rice plantation, as well as to grow indigo <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> pine trees for naval stores such as turpentine, pitch, tar, and rosin.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} of case-hardening is on screws, particularly self-drilling screws. In {{order for the}} screws {{to be able to}} drill, cut <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> into other materials like steel, the drill point and the forming threads must be harder than the material(s) that it is drilling into. However, if the whole screw is uniformly hard, it will become very brittle and it will break easily. This is overcome by ensuring that only the case is hardened and the core remains relatively soft. For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|E
25|$|From 1967 to 1983, it {{was home}} {{to one of the most}} {{remarkable}} newspaper experiments of recent times, when the Thomson Organisation launched the Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo. This comprised two evening papers – the Evening Echo and the Evening Post – and was based at a modern headquarters in Mark Road which had previously been used as a hot water bottle factory. The dual operation was conceived by Lord Thomson of Fleet to take on the Northcliffe and Beaverbrook domination of the London evening paper market <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> into what he saw as a major source of consumer advertising.|$|E
