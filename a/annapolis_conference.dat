25|$|In November 2007 the <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference</b> was held. The conference {{marked the}} first time a two-state {{solution}} was articulated as the mutually agreed-upon outline for addressing the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The conference ended with the issuing of a joint statement from all parties.|$|E
25|$|Though {{increasingly}} {{debated in}} academic circles, {{this approach has}} remained outside the range of official efforts to resolve the conflict as well as mainstream analysis, where it is eclipsed by the two-state solution. The two-state solution was most recently agreed upon in principle by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the November 2007 <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference</b> and remains the conceptual basis for negotiations proposed by the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama in 2011. Interest in a one-state solution is growing, however, as the two-state approach fails to accomplish a final agreement.|$|E
25|$|Olmert and his {{government}} enjoyed healthy relations with the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority, which culminated in November 2007 at the <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference.</b> However, during his tenure as prime minister, there were major military conflicts with both Hezbollah and Hamas (predominately in the Gaza Strip). Olmert and Minister of Defense Amir Peretz were heavily criticized for their handling of the 2006 Lebanon War. In late 2008, a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel ended, {{which led to the}} 2008 Israel-Gaza conflict. Olmert declared that the Israeli Defense Force would target the Hamas leadership and infrastructure in the war.|$|E

[...] He wrote that on 19 April 2006, following the elections in Israel but before Ehud Olmert was sworn in, he met with Abbas, and Abbas requested that negotiations resume immediately with the new Israeli government and that he be put in touch right away with a contact person to be appointed by the prime minister. Sneh reported that he immediately conveyed the substance of their meeting to the prime minister's office, but {{was told that the}} prime minister had no interest in the matter. Despite this, Sneh mentions that the <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference</b> convened {{a year and a half}} later, and that in September 2008, Prime Minister Olmert and Abbas came to understandings that would lead to an actual agreement.|$|E
2500|$|PeaceMaker is {{described}} by its creators as [...] "a video game to teach peace", and is primarily intended for Israeli and Palestinian students. In November 2007, the Peres Center for Peace funded the distribution of [...] copies in Israel and Palestine. [...] copies are sent to the subscribers of the Israeli daily [...] Haaretz, [...] to subscribers to the Palestinian daily Al-Quds. The remaining [...] are distributed in high-schools of both sides. This action is made {{in conjunction with the}} <b>Annapolis</b> <b>conference,</b> during which all parties agree on the two-state solution. Shortly after the Centre set up the [...] "PeaceMaker Educational Program". It consists in using the game in Israeli and Palestinian schools, and to lead a supervised debate with the students. Over fifty workshops were held in 2008, involving [...] students from two states. This total amounts to [...] students in September 2009.|$|E

During this period, more precisely during the 2007 Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, {{he served as}} Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP) in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Coordinator, Luís de Almeida Sampaio organized {{a meeting of the}} Quartet on the Middle East (comprising the United States of America, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia) in Lisbon in 2007 and participated in the 2007 <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference</b> and travelled extensively throughout the Middle East.” Almeida Sampaio said at the time about the need of designing and reaching an everlasting solution for the issue of the Middle East: “Never before has the problem of peace in the Middle East become such a matter of immediate, common and everyday concern in the consciousness of the international public opinion, particularly in the European one.” ...|$|E
50|$|Cornwallis Park {{was home}} to the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre's main {{administrative}} office, located in the former base commanders residence. A {{significant portion of the}} former military base's facilities (particularly housing, hospitality, meeting rooms and assembly halls) have been taken over by the <b>Annapolis</b> Basin <b>Conference</b> Centre. Cornwallis Park hosts over 1000 Royal Canadian Sea Cadets annually for training through CSTC HMCS Acadia. Many of the married quarters (PMQs) have been sold for private residences.|$|R
50|$|The town, {{along with}} most of Annapolis and Digby counties, {{experienced}} a severe economic decline during the mid-1990s after a nearby military training base, CFB Cornwallis, was closed {{as a result of}} federal government budget cuts. The former base located on the shores of the Annapolis Basin was formerly the site of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, but this too was closed by the federal government after a decade of successful operation with international participants from over 130 countries. It is now the home of the <b>Annapolis</b> Basin <b>Conference</b> Centre and an industrial park for small businesses. The HMCS Acadia sea-cadets camp is held there every summer.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{violence}} of the second intifada, IPF garnered broad support for the Gaza disengagement plan as a step toward renewed Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and hosted Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for a landmark speech that signaled his forthcoming political transformation.

2500|$|Henry {{also sought}} to advance Virginia's development, both as {{governor}} and through his personal investments. He backed schemes to open navigation on the upper Potomac and James rivers, envisioning canals to connect them to the Ohio River Valley. He also supported a scheme to [...] have a [...] canal across the [...] Great Dismal Swamp, believing that with it, the trade of Eastern North Carolina would flow through Norfolk. He owned land along the proposed route, and sought to interest General Washington in the scheme, but was not successful. Despite Henry's support for internal improvements, he failed to notify Virgnia's representatives of their appointment to meet with Maryland over navigation on the Potomac, and only two, including George Mason, attended {{what became known as}} the Mount Vernon Conference (1785). Edmund Randolph, unable to attend because of lack of timely notification, hinted that the reason for Henry's neglect was not forgetfulness, but a growing hostility towards things federal. In 1786, Henry was more assiduous in notifying delegates to the <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference</b> called with the support of Madison, who was appointed a delegate. Henry stepped down at the end of his fifth term, stating he needed to devote time to his family and earn money to support it.|$|E

Working with our Jordanian and Egyptian partners, and hopefully other Arab states, we must pursue a comprehensive peace with energy and vision.... But the talks must be a discussion, not an ultimatum." [...] On 4 November 2007, he declared Israel's intention {{to negotiate with the}} Palestinians about all issues, stating, [...] "Annapolis will be the jumping-off point for continued serious and in-depth negotiations, which will not avoid any issue or ignore any division that has clouded our relations with the Palestinian people for many years." [...] On 29 November 2007, he warned of the end of Israel in case a two-state solution is not eventually found for the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. [...] "If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights (also for the Palestinians in the territories), then, as soon as that happens, the State of Israel is finished", Olmert said {{on the last day of}} the <b>Annapolis</b> <b>Conference.</b> [...] "The Jewish organizations, which were our power base in America, will be the first to come out against us", Olmert said, [...] "because they will say they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents".|$|E

40|$|Recent detections of GeV photons {{in a few}} GRBs by Fermi-LAT {{have led}} to strong {{constraints}} on the bulk Lorentz factor in GRB outflows. To avoid a large gamma gamma optical depth, minimum values of the Lorentz factor {{are estimated to be}} as high as 800 - 1200 in some bursts. Here we present a detailed calculation of the gamma gamma optical depth taking into account both the geometry and the dynamics of the jet. In the framework of the internal shock model, we compute lightcurves in different energy bands and the corresponding spectrum and we show how the limits on the Lorentz factor can be significantly lowered compared to previous estimates.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, radio {{detection}} of cosmic rays has matured from small-scale prototype experiments to installations spanning several km$^ 2 $ {{with more than}} a hundred antennas. The physics of the radio signal is well understood and simulations and measurements are in good agreement. We have learned how to extract important cosmic ray parameters such as the geometry of the air shower and the energy of the primary particle from the radio signal, and have developed very promising approaches to also determine the mass of the primary particles. At the same time, limitations have become increasingly clear. I review the progress made in the past decade and provide a personal view on further potential for future development.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the unusual optical light curve of the gamma-ray burst GRB~ 081029, which occurred at a redshift of z = 3. 8479 $. We combine X-ray and optical observations from the Swift X-Ray Telescope and the Swift UltraViolet/Optical Telescope with optical and infrared data obtained using the REM and ROTSE telescopes to construct a detailed data set extending from 86 s to approximately 100, 000 s after the BAT trigger. Our data also cover a wide energy range, from 10 keV to 0. 77 eV (1. 24 Angstrom to 16, 000 Angstrom). The X-ray afterglow shows a shallow initial decay followed by a rapid decay starting at about 18, 000 s. The optical and infrared afterglow, however, shows an uncharacteristic rise at about 5000 s that does not correspond to any feature in the X-ray light curve. Our data are not consistent with synchrotron radiation from a single-component jet interacting with an external medium. We do, however, find that the observed light curve can be explained using multi-component model for the jet.

40|$|SN 1996 cr, {{located in}} the Circinus Galaxy (3. 7 Mpc, z ~ 0. 001) was non-detected in X-rays at ~ 1000 days yet brightened to ~ 4 x 10 ^{ 39 } erg/s (0. 5 - 8 keV) after 10 years (Bauer et al. 2008). A 1 -D {{hydrodynamic}} model of the ejecta-CSM interaction produces good agreement with the measured X-ray light curves and spectra at multiple epochs. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 1996 cr {{could have been a}} massive star, M > 30 M_solar, which went from an RSG to a brief W-R phase before exploding within its ~ 0. 04 pc wind-blown shell (Dwarkadas et al. 2010). Further analysis of the deep Chandra HETG observations allows line-shape fitting of a handful of bright Si and Fe lines in the spectrum. The line shapes are well fit by axisymmetric emission models with an axis orientation ~ 55 degrees to our line-of-sight. In the deep 2009 epoch the higher ionization Fe XXVI emission is constrained to high lattitudes: the Occam-est way to get the Fe H-like emission coming from high latitude/polar regions is to have more CSM at/around the poles than at mid and lower lattitudes, along with a symmetric ejecta explosion/distribution. Similar CSM/ejecta characterization may be possible for other SNe and, with higher-throughput X-ray observations, for gamma-ray burst remnants as well. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures.
