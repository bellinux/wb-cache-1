5|$|Transport {{suffered}} severely: several main roads, including {{part of the}} Trans-Canada Highway and Nova Scotia Highway 102, {{in northeastern}} Nova Scotia received flood damage and were temporarily blocked off. Additionally, the rising waters washed out several bridges {{in the region and}} swept away automobiles. Railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation. Drinking water in Dartmouth was contaminated due to excessive runoff into Lake Antigonish, and <b>a</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>park</b> in Antigonish flooded, prompting 600 residents to evacuate. Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated at between $3.5 million and $5.1 million USD. One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by <b>a</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>park</b> near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E

5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away <b>a</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>park</b> in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
