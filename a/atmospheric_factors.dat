5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many <b>atmospheric</b> <b>factors</b> into account. Human input is still required {{to pick the}} best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E

40|$|Coal {{combustion}} is {{the primary}} anthropogenic source of atmospheric iodine, which has important environmental and health effects. The iodine distribution in Chinese coals and the <b>atmospheric</b> iodine emission <b>factors</b> of coal-fired boilers are studied to estimate the iodine atmospheric flux from coal combustion in China from 1995 to 2009. The national average iodine content weighted by coal yield fluctuated from 2. 61 mg kg(- 1) in 1995 to 2. 09 mg kg(- 1) in 2009, recording an annual decline of 1. 42 %. By establishing a monitoring program, iodine distribution in coal by-products after the coal is consumed in combustors is measured, and <b>atmospheric</b> iodine emission <b>factors</b> by sectors are calculated. Based on the coal consumption by sectors, the annual atmospheric iodine emission from coal combustion in China increased {{at an annual rate}} of 4. 3 % from 3031. 1 tons in 1995 to 4872. 6 tons in 2009.

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{concept of}} retail {{atmospherics}} refers to sensations caused by sight, sound, scent, and touch in retail stores. These factors are given considerable weight by retailers when deciding {{how best to}} market and present products and services to consumers. Yet, retailers seldom examine these atmospheric variables {{from the perspective of}} employees. The purpose of this research is to examine whether music can be manipulated as a retail store <b>atmospheric</b> <b>factor</b> to improve employee mood levels and reduce stress, thereby enhancing creativity in solving business problems. The study design involves a 3 × 2 experiment. The music variable has three conditions: (1) mood-inducing music (2) non-mood-inducing music and (3) no music. The second variable, time pressure, also has two conditions: (1) high time pressure (9 minutes) and (2) low time pressure (18 minutes). The time frame variable is introduced to recreate the time pressure that retail employees sometimes experience in the work environment. The type of music to be played in the main study will be {{selected on the basis of}} a pretest where mood measures will be obtained for different types of music. Subjects in the main study will be given three different problem scenarios that simulate actual situations they might encounter while working for a retail store. They will be asked to devise as many solutions to the problems that they can think of within the allotted time frame. Participants will then fill out a short questionnaire designed to assess their mood and arousal levels, their perception of the music (if exposed to the music condition), and other factors that may influence their performance. The creativity of respondents' answers will be assessed on two dimensions: novelty and appropriateness of the solutions (Gardner 1993, Sternberg and Lubart 1999). The results of this research will contribute to our knowledge of the relationship between music, mood levels, and creativity and ultimately help retailers devise more productive work environments.
