5000|$|Response: Response <b>pagers</b> are <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> {{equipped}} with built-in transmitters, {{with the ability}} to acknowledge/confirm messages. They also allow the user to reply to messages by way of a multiple-choice response list, and to initiate [...] "canned" [...] messages from pre-programmed address and message lists. These devices are sometimes called [...] "1.5-way pagers" [...] or [...] "1.7-way pagers" [...] depending on capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Operator Messaging is the term, {{similar to}} Text Messaging and Voice Messaging, {{applying}} to an answering service call center who focuses on one specific scripting style {{that has grown}} out of the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pager</b> history.|$|E
50|$|Alpha Dispatch {{service is}} best {{described}} as enhanced numeric paging. It is a service that consists of live operators who answer incoming calls and input the callers' messages on a computer, then transmit the message using the Telocator Alphanumeric input Protocol to the paging provider's radio towers. Alphanumeric pagers receive the messages {{in the form of}} words and numbers. Messages are sequentially numbered and archived for later reference if required to be re-sent. PageNet was one of the larger paging providers who offered this service add-on to their <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pager</b> customers.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{developed}} a novel feature in their clinical information systems, which allows clinicians to request notification about laboratory results. Clinicians who are expecting a particular laboratory result {{for a particular}} patient can request {{a report of the}} result via an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pager</b> as soon as the result is filed into the patient database. This feature has gained popularity and is heavily used in both inpatient and outpatient settings, {{at a rate of about}} 2, 300 times per month. This event-monitor-based feature illustrates one way that information technology can be applied to improve communication in health care...|$|E
50|$|EMBARC (Electronic Mail Broadcast to A Roaming Computer) was a {{business}} enterprise of the Motorola company that provided wireless broadcast of e-mail and news to mobile subscribers. It was established in 1990 after Motorola purchased Contemporary Communications, a national carrier for pagers in the 900 MHz band. Unfortunately, <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> did not show rapid growth in the market, forming less than 5% of all pagers by 1991.|$|R
50|$|Although the Minitor is {{primarily}} used by emergency personnel, other {{agencies such as}} utilities and private contractors also use the <b>pager.</b> Unlike conventional <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> and cell phones, Minitors are operated on an RF network that is generally restricted to a particular agency in a given geographical area. The Minitor {{is the most common}} voice pager used by emergency services in the United States. However, digital 2-way pagers that can display alpha-numeric characters can overcome some of the limitations of voice only pagers, are now starting to replace the Minitor pagers in certain applications.|$|R
40|$|TCP/IP and World-Wide-Web (WWW) {{technology}} {{have become the}} universal standards for networking and delivery of information. Personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular telephones, and <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> are rapidly converging on a single pocket device that will leverage wireless TCP/IP networks and WWW protocols {{and can be used}} to deliver clinical information and alerts anytime, anywhere.

40|$|We {{elicited}} {{from medical}} house staff their preferences for e-mail and <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pager</b> as communication channels for {{the delivery of}} 18 different types of clinical information about their inpatients. For each type, we calculated the proportion of users who preferred delivery by e-mail, pager, both, or neither (usual delivery). For 14 / 18 (78 %) types, more users preferred delivery by pager than by the other options. For 2 / 18 (11 %) types, e-mail was preferred. For 2 / 18 (11 %) types, more users preferred redundant delivery using both channels. For no types did more users prefer neither, meaning that the information would be delivered by traditional channels, if any. We conclude that medical house staff in the inpatient setting prefer to receive many types of clinical information by pager. The {{reason may be that}} they otherwise would have to query clinical information systems for these data, which is wasteful of their time and introduces delays into the process of care. Additionally, we found significant inter-user variability, suggesting that it may be useful for the notification services of an enterprise to employ user profiles for the delivery of clinical information...|$|E
40|$|Demands for {{uninterrupted}} {{availability of}} systems that were hitherto not viewed as {{critical to the}} success of the enterprise has placed a burden upon support infrastructures for those systems. The small-to-medium help desk for a system that comprises part of an enterprise information system is under increasing pressure to provide round-the-clock support, while staffing budgets may not have caught up with the fiscal realities of covering second- or thirdshift on-site personnel. While the volume of calls outside normal hours may be small, a guaranteed turnaround and response to emergencies is essential for many IT operations to gain the trust of their customers. This paper describes a system for automated answering of the help desk telephone during non-peak hours, and for notifying on-call staff of emergencies within minutes. The system uses two voice-capable modems on a well-maintained computer for presenting to the caller a typical phone menu hierarchical menu which may include an option to record a message about some type of emergency. In this event, the system will notify the staff who are on call at that time for that type of emergency, contacting them by means they have specified in advance, such as voice telephone, numeric or <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pager,</b> or other means. The system is currently undergoing testing in the Enterprise Information System File Service at JPL...|$|E
40|$|Background: Text-messaging {{systems have}} been used to promote a range of health behaviors, {{including}} medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virusâ€“positive individuals. However, little is currently known about the specific characteristics of messaging systems that promote user engagement. Objective: Using data from a randomized controlled trial involving a pager-based text messaging system, this study sought to examine the overall usability of the system, user evaluation of the system, demographic and psychosocial correlates of usability, and its performance as an adherence assessment tool. Materials and Methods: The messaging system consisted of an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pager</b> capable of sending and receiving individualized text messages and the software necessary to program and track communication. The system was evaluated using behavioral outcomes (pager message response rate), self-report survey responses, focus group discussions, and data from electronic medication monitoring pill bottles. Results: Although the majority of participants reported that the system was effective in reminding them to take medication doses, the overall response rate to system messages was relatively low (42. 8 %) and dropped significantly {{over the course of the}} 3 -month intervention period. In addition, user engagement did not differ significantly by most demographic and psychosocial variables. Conclusions: The pager-based text messaging system was received well by participants and appears to be applicable to a broad population; however, the system did not actively engage all participants over the course of the trial. Future research should determine whether systems customized to personal preference in notification style, frequency, and user device can increase use and provide further assistance to achieve optimal medication adherence...|$|E

50|$|Founded by Mr. Hsu Ching-Kuang in October, 1995. Gold Apollo {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{companies}} dedicate in producing POCSAG/FLEX (protocol) pagers. At beginning of funding, Gold Apollo produced only numeric pagers and focus the markets in domestic. In the late 90's, Gold Apollo developed a whole new <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> and started aiming worldwide markets. In order to fulfill the requirement from many countries in the world. The company expanded their product-lines such as RF transmitter, receiver, wireless LED display. Recently, the company focuses on using these RF products for different applications in hospital, restaurant and other facilities.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the use of}} <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> {{declined}} in the mid-1990s and cell phone text messaging availability and reliability increased ever since, these well-established alpha-dispatch call centers adjusted their technology to allow live operators' messages to be transmitted to cellular service providers {{in the same way}} as to pager service providers. Operators still follow the same answering procedures and have no idea if the subscriber is receiving the text message on a cell phone or a pager. The operator still serves as a [...] "relay" [...] or [...] "bridge" [...] for the caller to dictate their message to the operator messaging subscriber's device.|$|R
50|$|Although e-mail {{capabilities}} {{have been}} extended to <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> and cellular text messaging, the operator messaging services are used by individuals who are not located near a computer or where sending a text message may be dangerous or impractical. Live operator messaging marries the technologies of voice messaging and text messaging {{as an alternative to}} voicemail service by using call forwarding features to redirect callers of your cell phone automatically to the operator messaging service after three or four unanswered rings. Operator messaging service providers remain profitable because the average call length is under 30 seconds and employees are often paid less than full-service answering service employees due to the limited training required.|$|R
50|$|As {{wireless}} communication technologies {{increased in the}} late 1980s, the Pager service providers created a subscription service offered {{in a variety of}} plans and options {{to meet the needs of}} a subscriber and the type of device used. In general, all pagers are given unique telephone numbers so that callers could dial in and send a numeric message, such as their callback number or a numerically coded special message, such as room numbers to report to, etc. However, <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> could only receive text messages when the message sender had installed software on their PC to dial into the publicly accessible modems operated by the paging service provider to then transmit their message over-the-air through the network of radio towers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a class of}} intelligent agents called Information Integration Agents. These agents are particularly well suited to application on the Internet, {{and can be used}} to satisfy a wide range of needs. We discuss two prototype Information Integration Agents that have been deployed on the Internet. One, the BargainFinder agent, has been active for over 9 months amidst considerable interest from Internet users and the mass media. BargainFinder performs comparison price shopping among a number of on-line CD stores. The second, the NewsFinder agent, is currently being tested internally. NewsFinder retrieves on-line news articles, matches them against user profiles, and transmits them via portable ubiquitous displays (currently <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers).</b> We discuss these agents and the class of Information Integration Agents in general, and conjecture that agents of this sort will be extremely valuable to a broad spectrum of Internet users. 1...|$|R
50|$|Computer-aided {{dispatch}} (CAD), {{also called}} computer-assisted dispatch, {{is a method}} of dispatching taxicabs, couriers, field service technicians, mass transit vehicles or emergency services assisted by computer. It can either be used to send messages to the dispatchee via a mobile data terminal (MDT) and/or used to store and retrieve data (i.e. radio logs, field interviews, client information, schedules, etc.). A dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a two-way radio. Some systems communicate using a two-way radio system's selective calling features. CAD systems may send text messages with call-for-service details to <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> or wireless telephony text services like SMS. The central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched. CAD provides displays and tools so that the dispatcher {{has an opportunity to}} handle calls-for-service as efficiently as possible.|$|R

40|$|Automated {{physiologic}} event {{detection and}} alerting is a challenging {{task in the}} ICU. Ideally care providers should be alerted only when events are clinically significant and there is opportunity for corrective action. However, the concepts of clinical significance and opportunity are difficult to define in automated systems, and effectiveness of alerting algorithms is difficult to measure. This paper describes recent efforts on the Simon project to capture information from ICU care providers about patient state and therapy in response to alerts, {{in order to assess}} the value of event definitions and progressively refine alerting algorithms. Event definitions for intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were studied by implementing a reliable system to automatically deliver alerts to clinical users <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers,</b> and to capture associated documentation about patient state and therapy when the alerts occurred. During a 6 -month test period in the trauma ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 530 alerts were detected in 2280 hours of data spanning 14 patients. Clinical users electronically documented 81 % of these alerts as they occurred. Retrospectively classifying documentation based on therapeutic actions taken, or reasons why actions were not taken, provided useful information about ways to potentially improve event definitions and enhance system utility...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} have access to {{information}} relevant to patient care is essential within the healthcare environment. To meet the information needs of its workers, healthcare information systems must fulfill a variety of functional requirements. One of these requirements is to define how workers will interact with the system to gain the information they need. Currently, most healthcare information systems rely on users querying the system via a fixed terminal for the information they desire; a method that is inefficient because there is no guarantee the information will be available {{at the time of their}} query and it interrupts their work flow. In general, clinical event monitors [...] systems whose efficacy relies on the delivery of time-critical information [...] have used e-mail and numeric pagers as their methods to deliver information. Each of these methods, however, still requires the user to perform additional steps, i. e., log into an information system in order to attain the information about which the system is alerting them. In this paper we describe the integration and use of 2 -way <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> in CLEM, the UPMC Health System's Clinical Event Monitor, and how the use of these pagers addresses the information needs of mobile workers in healthcare...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{centralized}} electrocardiogram telemetry {{monitoring system}} (TMS) facilitates early identification of critical arrhythmias and acute medical decompensation. Timely intervention {{can only be}} performed if abnormalities are communicated rapidly to the direct caregiver. The study objectives were to measure effectiveness of bi-directional voice communication badges versus one-way <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers</b> for telemetry alarm response and communication loop closure. Methods: A sequential observational pilot study of nursing response to TMS alarms compared communication technologies on four nursing units in a 1, 061 bed tertiary care hospital with 264 TMS channels of telemetry over a 2 -year period. Subsequently, the communication technologies were compared in a randomized fashion on a 68 -bed progressive cardiac care unit. Caregivers were blinded to the protocol. All alarm responses were recorded during two periods using either pagers or voice communication devices. Alarm response time and closure of the communication loop were analyzed in a blinded fashion. Results: The direct communication functionality of the badge significantly shortened the time to first contact, time to completion, and rate of closure of the communication loop in both the pilot and study phases. Median time to first contact with the communication badge was 0. 5 [*]min, compared to 1. 6 [*]min with pager communication (p[*]<[*] 0. 0003). Communication loop closure was achieved in 100 % of clinical alarms using the badge versus 19 % with the pager (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Conclusions: Communication badge technology reduced alarm time to first contact and completion as well as facilitated communication loop closures. Immediate two-way communication significantly impacted practice, alarm management, and resulted in faster bedside care...|$|R

When Quon and another officer continued to exceed the limit and reimburse the city, Duke told then-Chief Lloyd Scharf he was [...] "tired of being a bill collector". The OPD began to consider whether the character limit it had contracted for was too low and it was forcing officers to pay for work-related communications, as had sometimes happened in the past.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990 International Teletrac Systems (later PacTel Teletrac), {{founded in}} Los Angeles CA, {{introduced}} the world's first dynamic real-time stolen vehicle recovery services. As an adjacency to this they began developing location based services that could transmit information about location-based {{goods and services}} to custom-programmed <b>alphanumeric</b> Motorola <b>pagers.</b> In 1996 Todd Glassey designed the first Digital Timestamp Server for Email and other content validation and created the first instances of [...] "GeoSpatial Keying" [...] a complex cryptographic process for using time and location data to access or 'unlock' certain key services. Glassey proceeded with his Digital Evidence System {{which was based on}} location and digital object control at the service and network layer interfaces. Later that same year (1996) the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) issued rules requiring all US mobile operators to locate emergency callers. This rule was a compromise resulting from US mobile operators seeking the support of the emergency community in order to obtain the same protection from lawsuits relating to emergency calls as fixed-line operators already had.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. For paratransit passengers, not knowing when their ride (the paratransit vehicle) will be arriving to pick them up is a major concern. The objectives of this research included designing, implementing, and evaluating a system for automatically notifying paratransit customers in advance of the upcoming arrival of their ride. The core of the Vehicle Arrival Notification System (VANS) was an algorithm that estimated the time remaining until the vehicle's arrival at future passenger pick-up points, based on GPS-based Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) and the vehicle's scheduled itinerary of stops. A twenty-two (22) day demonstration of the notification system was conducted with Texas A&M University's paratransit service. At the time of the demonstration, there were nine (9) regular users of the service; of these, eight (8) chose to participate in the demonstration and were supplied with personal <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>pagers.</b> Equipment-related problems during the demonstration prevented the AVL-equipped vehicle from transmitting data. In the absence of AVL information, VANS simply sent messages to passengers a few minutes before the scheduled arrival time of their ride. The accuracy of the new system's arrival-time prediction with AVL data was evaluated via computer simulations. The reliability of the page-sending process was between forty-four (44) and sixty-four (64) percent during the demonstration; all but five (5) percent of this unreliability was due to known and preventable causes such as the computer hardware being unplugged. The computer simulations predicted that, in future applications, VANS could predict arrival times accurate to within plus or minus five (5) minutes for at least ninety-five (95) percent of trips. Passengers using the system generally favored future notification programs. The demonstration's effects, if any, on the paratransit agency's operational characteristics were uncertain. The objectives of this research were accomplished, as a viable notification system was designed, implemented, and evaluated. Future studies may involve improving the VANS software, investigating funding alternatives for notification, developing transportation networks tailored to fit paratransit operations, and measuring the benefits and other effects of implementing a notification system, from the perspective of both the paratransit provider and the paratransit customer...|$|R
