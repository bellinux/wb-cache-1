5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as a qualitative test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> soluble deliquescent compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E

There are also many fast food restaurants serving Cantonese and other Chinese dishes, including the franchised Maxim's and Café de Coral. Jaffe Road and Lockhart Road are famous for pubs.|$|E

The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> popular in their respective countries.|$|E
25|$|The nine bridges {{that make}} up the Metal Highway Bridges of Fulton County were all {{constructed}} between c. 1880 and c. 1915. All nine bridges were and are located on county and township roads in rural settings, and <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> similar in their construction materials and methods. They are early examples of steel truss bridges in Illinois.|$|E

25|$|The {{diversity}} of cuisine is {{reflective of the}} social and economic {{diversity of}} Bangalore. Bangalore has a wide and varied mix of restaurant types and cuisines and Bangaloreans deem eating out as an intrinsic part of their culture. Roadside vendors, tea stalls, and South Indian, North Indian, Chinese and Western fast food <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> popular in the city. Udupi restaurants are very popular and serve predominantly vegetarian, regional cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} of the Khoisan's original presence in South Africa is the distribution of their languages today. Khoisan language groups often have extreme differences in structure and vocabulary despite close proximity, which demonstrates {{a long period of}} settlement and co-evolution of languages in the same region. In contrast, the languages of Bantu-origin peoples in the region such as the Zulu and Xhosa <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> similar to one another. This indicates a much more recent common ancestry for the first Bantu group that spread and settled across the region. Among their descendants, the Xhosa and Zulu adopted unique Khoisan click consonants and loan words into their respective languages.|$|E
25|$|After surgery, {{patients}} feel fullness after ingesting {{only a small}} {{volume of}} food, followed soon thereafter {{by a sense of}} satiety and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplements <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> important to the post-operative bypass patient.|$|E
25|$|The Ms. Ludwig XV 13, also titled Fior di Battaglia, is {{currently}} in the holdings of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, CA. Its prologue, format, illustrations, and text <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> similar to the Ms. M.383, though it's largely free of silver enamel. The text {{takes the form of}} descriptive paragraphs set in poor Italian verse, which are nevertheless fairly clear and informative. Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, {{not the least of which}} is the vastly different order of the information. This is the longest and most comprehensive of the four manuscripts of Fior di Battaglia. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Getty version'.|$|E

25|$|On 21 September 1964, {{the island}} was granted {{independence}} as the State of Malta, a member in the Commonwealth of Nations and a Commonwealth realm. A set of 6 values was issued for this event, also designed by Emvin Cremona, who designed virtually every set up to 1971. These sets <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> cheap but highly collectible. Christmas stamps started in 1964 and have focused mostly on Nativity scenes. The 1965 definitives showed various episodes from the History of Malta and are considered {{some of the finest}} ever issued. Many varieties exist on this issue, from misplaced or omitted colours to imperforate stamps. The Malta Philatelic Society has been established on 7 March 1966. Malta joined CEPT in 1971 and has issued Europa stamps annually since then.|$|E
25|$|I return herewith, under {{separate}} cover, the 'Pearl of Great Price.' The 'Book of Abraham,' it {{is hardly}} necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy {{of one of the}} magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies. There were about forty of these latter known in museums and they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> similar in character. Joseph Smith's interpretation of these cuts is a farrago of nonsense from beginning to end. Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes' study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum should be enough to convince any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture.|$|E
25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> interesting, {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.|$|E

They <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> curious about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E

The idea for the range originated with the firm's marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: [...] "I was brought up on hotpot and Coronation Street. So when I joined Holland's a year ago, it seemed right to put the two together with Betty's hotpot." [...] Day added that: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> excited about Betty's Kitchen products.
