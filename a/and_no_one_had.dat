5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not legal tender <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> to take them. The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's Indian Head cent.|$|E
5|$|Peiper {{asked the}} Battalion {{commander}} and a Hauptmann (captain) {{in the same}} unit about the American resistance. Both said they had not personally seen the Americans, but that the woods were heavily fortified. Peiper learned that no patrols had been conducted into the woods <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> personally reconnoitered the area. Disgusted, Peiper demanded that von Hoffman give him a battalion of paratroops to accompany his tanks. At 4:30a.m. on December 17, more than 18 hours behind schedule, the 1st SS Panzer Division rolled out of Lanzareth and headed northwest for Bucholz Station. The entire timetable of their advance on the River Meuse and Antwerp had been seriously slowed, allowing the Americans precious hours to move in reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

25|$|McCormick's {{body was}} found on June 30, 1999 near a West Alton, Missouri cornfield by a woman driving along a field road off Route 367. The reason he was 15 miles away from his current address is another mystery, as he did not own a car and the area is not served by public transportation. Though the body had already {{somewhat}} decomposed, authorities used fingerprints to identify McCormick. There was no indication that anyone had a motive to kill McCormick <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> reported him missing, so the authorities initially ruled out homicide, but no {{cause of death was}} officially determined at the time. McCormick was last seen alive five days earlier, on June 25, 1999, getting a checkup at St. Louis' now-defunct Forest Park Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Owing to Siraj ud Dowla’s {{harshness}} of {{temper and}} indulgence, fear and terror had {{settled on the}} hearts of everyone {{to such an extent}} that no one among his generals of the army or the noblemen of the city was free from anxiety. Among his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraj ud Dowla despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraj ud Dowla treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Alivardi Khan with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them.

25|$|Lower courts {{decided that}} because the Commonwealth's Attorney doesn't prosecute {{fornication}} cases <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> been prosecuted for fornication anywhere in Virginia in over 100 years, Martin had no risk of prosecution and thus lacked standing to challenge the statute. Martin appealed. Since Martin had something to lose - the ability to sue Ziherl for damages - if the statute is upheld, she had standing to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} statute even though the possibility of her being prosecuted for violating it was zero. Since the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence has found that there is a privacy right in one's private, noncommercial sexual practices, the Virginia Supreme Court decided that the statute against fornication was unconstitutional. The finding gave Martin standing to sue Ziherl since the decision in Zysk was no longer applicable.|$|E

500|$|Unfortunately, their {{crossing}} also {{coincided with}} the great swelling of the infamous witchcraft delusion. More than 125 people had been arrested on charges of witchcraft, and were being held in Boston and Salem prisons. On May 27, a special Court of Oyer and Terminer was created to hear the accumulated cases. Though Phips officially signed the commission, Increase Mather was likely the architect, as such courts were specifically mentioned in the new charter, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> spent more time working {{on the details of}} the charter than Increase Mather. Increase Mather's pick for Lieutenant Governor, William Stoughton, a lifelong bachelor, was chosen as chief judge of this new court. There was little then to indicate that Stoughton would proceed with such ruthless conviction. Phips later claimed to have chosen nominations for the court from [...] "persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon" [...] and indeed, as Thomas Brattle pointed out, most were well-known and respected merchants from the Boston area.|$|E
500|$|In 1833 Lincoln {{decided not}} to run for reelection, {{intending}} to return to private practice. He was instead prevailed upon in early 1834 to run for the recently vacated Congressional seat of fellow Worcester Whig John Davis, who had been elected governor. The race for governor was split three ways, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> won a majority, sending the election to the state legislature to decide. John Quincy Adams, who had run on the Anti-Masonic ticket, withdrew and endorsed Davis, preferring him over Morton and Davis was chosen by the legislature in January 1834. Davis had been reelected to his Congressional seat as well, and resigned that to assume the governorship. In a special election in February Lincoln was elected to the vacant Congressional seat. Lincoln served in the House of Representatives until 1841. [...] He did not particularly distinguish himself in Congress, generally supporting the Whig agenda and taking a firm stance on the outstanding border dispute between Maine and the British (now Canadian) province of New Brunswick.|$|E
500|$|On Friday 19 November 2004, 36-year-old Palm Island {{resident}} Cameron Doomadgee {{was arrested}} for public drunkenness and died in police custody an hour later. The coroner's report was released on Friday 26 November, and read to a community meeting. After hearing that Doomadgee had died from a ruptured liver in the scuffle at the island's watch-house, a succession of angry young Aboriginal men spoke to the crowd and encouraged immediate action be taken against the police. Doomadgee's death was repeatedly branded [...] "cold-blooded murder". Wotton joined 1,000 other people in a riot on Palm Island {{that resulted in the}} police station, the court house, and the home of the officer-in-charge being burned down. In a Friday interview with The Courier-Mail, Wotton justified the riot, saying that the residents did not believe the death was an accident and the residents had set fire to the police station because they had been [...] "crying out for help" [...] <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> listened. Additionally, Wotton sought an investigation by the Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC) and wanted the government to agree to move all police from the island.|$|E

500|$|Since her death, McClintock {{has been}} the subject of a {{biography}} by the science historian Nathaniel C. Comfort's The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock's Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control. Comfort's biography contests some claims about McClintock, described as the [...] "McClintock Myth", which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller. Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time. In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock's lab with the remark: 'By God, that woman is either crazy or a genius.' [...] " [...] As Auerbach tells it, McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour 'because of their arrogance. She was intolerant of arrogance... She felt she had crossed a desert alone <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> followed her.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Clark began {{planning}} {{work for}} {{responses to the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with Bosnian Serb military leaders including Ratko Mladić, who was later accused of war crimes and genocide. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A Washington Post story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador. Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was [...] "like cavorting with Hermann Göring." [...] Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved. He said there had been no warning <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> told him to cancel the visit, although two Congressmen called for his dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange, and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided. Clark said it was his [...] "first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility... and a painful few days." [...] Conservative pundit Robert Novak later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark's 2004 presidential campaign, citing it as a [...] "problem" [...] with Clark as a candidate.|$|E

2500|$|Lorch {{spent eight}} years {{restoring}} and refurbishing the building, including {{the removal of the}} four-story tower built by Millisent Dexter and rebuilding the wing similar to the original. [...] However, in 1950, before the rehabilitation was complete, McCormick gave the property to the University of Michigan, in part to help settle some of her own estate tax issues. [...] By some reports, the gift contained the stipulation that the interior be converted to apartments for university faculty and staff. [...] By other reports, the conversion was the University's idea <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> informed McCormick. [...] In any case, despite the controversial timing, contractors were swiftly employed, the interior was completely gutted, and the conversion was completed. One of the first occupants was Alexander Grant Ruthven, who moved into Gordon Hall after stepping down from the presidency of the University in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} fossils were {{discovered}} in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand {{what had happened to}} these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, Robert Hooke presented an impression of a nautilus to the Royal Society that was more than two feet in diameter, and morphologically distinct from any known living species. Hooke theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> discovered them yet. While he contended that [...] it was possible a species could be [...] "lost", he thought this highly unlikely. Similarly, in 1695, Thomas Molyneux published an account of enormous antlers found in Ireland that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area. Molyneux reasoned that they came from the North American moose and that the animal had once been common on the British Isles. Rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct, he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct, they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe. Using the antlers as evidence for this position, Molyneux described how moose had continued to exist in North America even as they were lost to the British Isles. The antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct Irish elk Megaloceros. Hooke and Molyneux's line of thinking was difficult to disprove. When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply [...] "hiding" [...] in unexplored regions of the Earth.|$|E
