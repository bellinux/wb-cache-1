However, Belknap, escorted by Interior Secretary Zachariah Chandler, rushed to the White House and met with Grant before his meeting with Representative Bass. Belknap appeared visibly upset or ill, mumbling something about protecting his wives' honor and beseeching Grant to accept his resignation [...] "at once." [...] Grant, in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to a photography studio for a formal portrait, regretfully agreed and accepted Belknap's resignation without reservation.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the fourth Test of the series against India in 1962 that Nurse was given another {{opportunity}} at Test level. Nurse was made only one run in the first innings and in the secon innings was 46 not {{out at the end of}} the matchthe West Indies won by 7 wickets. Nurse's next opportunity was with the West Indies team to England in 1963 but again he was affected by an injury that kept him lame for the greater part of the tour. He did not play a Test match but there was some qualified praise for his efforts in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "Nurse took a long time to justify the nice things claimed for him. He got himself out far too often through always being in too big <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on with the scoring, but in August he looked a very fine player." [...] He was given another opportunity to succeed in the sub-continent with a Commonwealth XI tour of Pakistan in 1963. Nurse scored 369 runs in six matches on tour including 126 not out in the final match against Pakistan at Dacca Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|This {{terminology}} was {{popularized by}} the Roman Catholic priest Andrew Greeley who wrote:The central symbol (of religion) is God. One's [...] "picture" [...] of God {{is in fact}} a metaphorical narrative of God's relationship with the world and the self as part of the world. ...The Catholic [...] "classics" [...] assume a God who is present in the world, disclosing Himself in and through creation. The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be somewhat like God. The Protestant classics, on the other hand, assume a God who is radically absent from the world, and who discloses (Himself) only on rare occasions (especially in Jesus Christ and Him crucified). The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be radically different from God.Runar Eldebo, a Swedish seminary instructor and correspondent for Pietisten (an online ecumenical newsletter), provided a Lutheran slant on Greeley's distinction between Catholic imagination and Protestant imagination. Invoking Karl Barth, Eldebo wrote:Protestant imagination is dialectic and makes people pilgrims. It is deep in conflict and antagonistic to the ingredients of a common, human life. Catholic imagination is analogical. It is founded in creation itself and views creation as God in disguise. According to Catholic imagination, God lurks everywhere. According to Protestant imagination, Karl Barth for example, God is hidden everywhere but found only in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Therefore, according to Greeley, Protestants are never at home on earth, they are pilgrims on their way. Catholics, meanwhile, like to dwell on earth. They enjoy life and are not in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to heaven because God lurks everywhere, especially where you do not expect her to be.|$|E
