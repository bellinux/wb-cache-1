5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} {{the forerunner of}} the electric clock, the electrostatic clock. It was powered with dry piles, a high voltage battery with extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with the weather. He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> meteorological conditions.|$|E
5|$|Gustav Theodore Holst (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874– 25 May 1934) was an English composer, {{arranger}} and teacher. Best {{known for}} his orchestral suite The Planets, he composed {{a large number of}} other works <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.|$|E

5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian expedition, led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{reached the}} {{position}} after a month-long advance north-east towards the Mahdist stronghold. The rebels, numbering two-thousand, {{had established a}} two-mile line <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> hills, giving their numerically superior forces a tactical advantage over Chaltin's eight-hundred men. After a failed flanking maneuver by the Mahdists, Chaltin's forces stormed the heights and dislodged the rebel defenders. The Congolese companies pursued the retreating Mahdists back towards the town of Rejaf, where a final defense was made and similarly defeated.|$|E

5|$|Morgan was {{appointed}} a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 {{and returned to}} Jamaica shortly afterward {{to serve as the}} territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor of Jamaica {{in the absence of the}} post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of Morgan's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; Morgan brought a libel suit against the book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed of Morgan has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> genres.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, {{which is a}} shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 (initially {{referred}} to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> skill levels {{to be able to}} play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.|$|E
