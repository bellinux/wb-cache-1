40|$|A part of {{the modern}} Swiss {{judiciary}} and doctrine have proposed a solution giving a party of an <b>ad</b> <b>referendum</b> contract a direct claim to execute the final agreement. This new approach («Einstufentheorie») is controversial and stands {{in opposition to the}} traditional view («Zweistufentheorie»).
