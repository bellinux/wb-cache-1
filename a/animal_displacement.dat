40|$|Rural {{tourism is}} {{becoming}} increasingly embedded in the livestock animal management in rural areas. Drawing on a multi-methods approach, this exploratory research shows how to construct the livestock <b>animal</b> <b>displacement</b> actor-networks. As is found, human actors (local governments, tourists, and local residents), non-human animal (livestock) and quasi-object (human dwellings) construct an interaction network in a structured way. The critical action route of livestock <b>animal</b> <b>displacement</b> demonstrated in this research is aimed to improve residents' participation willingness and further to change the local livestock feeding model and traditional dwelling by rural environment governance and rural tourism landscape consumption. Through the process of translation, problematization, interest, enrollment, mobilization and opposition, the livestock displacement actor-networks were constructed to build a heterogeneous network of the local government, tourists, local residents, livestock and human dwelling. The {{ultimate goal is to}} change the traditional human dwelling to a dis-dwelling; {{the most important thing is}} to promote residents’ participation willingness in the livestock displacement actor-networks. This article attempts to perform compelling exploratory research to elucidate the livestock displacement actor-networks in hope to provide a meaningful contribution to the epistemology and methodology of livestock management on rural tourism destination and open a new path for research on rural livestock-human relations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>displacement</b> plays {{a central}} role in many {{ecological}} questions. It can be interpreted as a combination of components that only depend on the animal (for example a random walk) and external influences given by the heterogeneity of the environment. Here we treat the case where animals switch between random walks in a homogeneous 2 D environment and its 1 D boundary, combined with a tendency for wall-following behaviour (thigmotactism) that is treated as a Markovian process. In the first part we use mesoscopic techniques to derive from these assumptions a set of partial differential equations (PDE) with specific boundary conditions and parameters that are directly given by the individual displacement parameters. All assumptions and approximations made during this derivation are rigorously validated for the case of exploratory behaviour of the ant Messor sanctus. These PDE predict that the stationary density ratio between the 2 D (centre) and 1 D (border) environment only depends on the thigmotactic component, not {{on the size of the}} centre or border areas. In the second part we test this prediction with the same exploratory behaviour of M. sanctus, in particular when many ants move around simultaneously and may interact directly or indirectly. The prediction holds when there is a low degree of heterogeneity (simple square arena with straight borders), the collective behaviour is "simply" the sum of the individual behaviours. But this prediction breaks down when heterogeneity increases (obstacles inside the arena) due to the emergence of pheromone trails. Our approach may be applied to study the effects of <b>animal</b> <b>displacement</b> in any environment where the animals are confronted with an alternation of 2 D space and 1 D borders as for example in fragmented landscapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) as a {{major source}} of {{dopamine}} neurons projecting to cortical and limbic regions has a crucial role in reward and addiction. The current study assessed the role of D 1 and D 2 receptors within the dorsal hippocampus (CA 1) in the expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) by intra-VTA morphine in the rats. In the present study, 160 adult male albino Wistar rats weighing 220 – 290 g were bilaterally implanted by two cannulae into the CA 1 and VTA. The CPP paradigm was done and <b>animal</b> <b>displacement,</b> conditioning score and locomotor activity were recorded. For blocking the dopamine D 1 /D 2 receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, SCH 23390 (0. 02, 0. 05, 0. 2 and 0. 5 �g per side) or sulpiride (0. 25, 0. 75, 1. 5 and 3 �g per side) were microinjected into the CA 1, just 5 min before the CPP test on the post-conditioning day. All animals received intra-VTA morphine (1 �g per side) during 3 -days conditioning phase. Our results showed that sulpiride (1. 5 and 3 �g) but not SCH 23390 in the dorsal hippocampus significantly decreased the expression of CPP induced by intra-VTA morphine (p < 0. 001). Intra-CA 1 administration of these antagonists alone, in all doses, could not induce CPP. We suggest that D 2 receptors in the CA 1 region of hippocampus have {{a key role in the}} expression of CPP induced by morphine at the level of the VTA and there is a relationship between dopaminergic D 2 receptors and opioidergic systems in these areas in reward circuit...|$|E

There was no effect on the binding of [3 H]QNB in the presence of pirenzipine.

Abomasal displacements typically occur in high production dairy cows. Abomasal displacements cause economic loss in dairy herds through decrease in milk production, permanent weight loss, treatment costs, death, and has also been considered {{to be having a}} negative impact on reproduction. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze prevalence of abomasal displacement in cattle in Bosnia and Herzegovina, considering the lack of the recorded data on this disorder. Clinical monitoring in one dairy farm was performed on 394 animals of Holstein – Frisian breed during 2008. The animals were divided into 3 groups according to age, in which Group 1 consisted of animals between 15 and 24 months, Group 2 between 2 and 7 years, and Group 3 older than 7 years. In this study, out of total of 394 animals, in 21 <b>animals</b> abomasal <b>displacement</b> was diagnosed with total prevalence of 5, 32 %.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the spatial {{structures}} of <b>animal</b> <b>displacements</b> and local-scale human motion follow Lévy flights. Whether transnational human activity (THA) also exhibits such a pattern has however not been thoroughly examined as yet. To fill this gap, this article examines the planet-scale spatial structure of THA (a) across eight types of mobility and communication and (b) in its development over time. Combining data from various sources, it is shown that the spatial structure of THA can indeed be approximated by Lévy flights with heavy tails that obey power laws. Scaling exponent and power-law fit differ by type of THA, being highest in refuge-seeking and tourism and lowest in student exchange. Variance in the availability of resources and opportunities for satisfying associated needs appears to explain these differences. Over time, the Lévy-flight pattern remains intact and remarkably stable, contradicting the popular idea that socio-technological trends lead to a "death of distance. " Longitudinal change occurs only in some types of THA and predominantly at short distances, indicating regional shifts rather than globalization...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the escape behavior of larvae and postlarvae of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) and of adult immature (stage ADI) crayfish (Cherax destructor). Responses to standardized water jet stimuli delivered through a pipette were observed and analyzed. Lobster larvae {{did not respond}} to stimuli within 60 ms, indicating {{that they do not have}} functional giant fibers. The first movement by lobster larvae in response to water jet stimuli was a hyperextension of the abdomen. Larval escape responses also showed very little habituation. Postlarval lobsters and ADI crayfish showed the same range of responses as adult <b>animals.</b> <b>Displacement</b> efficiency of tailflicks exhibited by the different animals and stages was examined and related to the morphology of the animals. A separate behavior from tailflicking by larval lobsters in response to water jet stimuli was also observed. Here, the abdomen was hyperextended and the thoracic appendages were promoted. We termed this behavior a 2 ̆ 7 starburst 2 ̆ 7 response. The features of the tailflicking behavior suggest that it evolved to make the larvae difficult prey to handle for small, slower moving predators, and possibly to allow them to ride the bow waves of faster moving predators...|$|R
50|$|In the {{assessment}} of <b>animal</b> welfare, <b>displacement</b> activities are sometimes used as evidence that an animal is highly motivated to perform a behaviour that the environment prevents. One example is that when hungry hens are trained to eat from a particular food dispenser and then ﬁnd the dispenser blocked, they often begin to pace and preen themselves vigorously. These actions have been interpreted as displacement activities, and similar pacing and preening {{can be used as}} evidence of frustration in other situations.|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{affecting}} farmed cattle compromise {{both human}} and animal health and welfare, and represent {{a major cause of}} loss in economic revenue. Their spread is known to be driven, or at least facilitated, by <b>animal</b> <b>displacements</b> among livestock holdings, both within and across countries. As a result, studying the networks of animal movements is a key step in devising new prevention and containment strategies. Past works have already analyzed cattle networks in several European countries, highlighting complex interactions between topology, function and dynamics at different spatial and time resolutions. A comprehensive study, showing the impact of country-specific driving factors on network evolution and topology, is however still missing. By using data from several European countries, and focusing on the features relevant for the spread of infections, we perform a comparative analysis to highlight both general and country-specific patterns. We find that coarse-graining the structure into statistical distributions of centrality measures is an effective way to highlight the properties shared by all networks, which represent the fingerprint of a livestock market. The situation dramatically changes when we zoom in to the microscopic structure, as we find several country-specific characteristics, especially in temporal evolution. This twofold behavior suggests that on one hand it is possible to identify several global patterns in the ways animal disease spread, which can then be applied to countries for which data are unavailable, or incomplete. On the other hand, resolved country-specific data are needed when devising tailored and targeted intervention strategie...|$|R

40|$|A lively debate {{exists on}} the {{inherent}} stochasticity involved in many <b>animal</b> search <b>displacements</b> and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no prior information about the location of targets, such as patches of food resource or potential mates, different random search strategies may provide different degrees of success. It {{has been suggested that}} a particular class of random walks, known as Lévy walks, offers optimal stochastic search strategies when faced with environmental uncertainty. The properties of Lévy walks, which include superdiffusion and fractality, {{have been shown to be}} particularly useful in non-destructive searching cases; cases in which a site or a resource is not eliminated after it has been located, and therefore can be revisited. In this project we conducted a human behavioral searching experiment on a group blind folded human volunteers whom were asked to search for targets in a soccer field. By recording the walking path of each volunteer, our goal was to categorize the properties of human random searches. Our results show that the general search strategy of blind folded humans resembles pure Brownian motion. However, when categorizing the volunteers according to their degree of success, we found that the searching strategy of the most successful group clearly deviated from a Brownian type of motion towards a Lévy-like type motion. We discuss the relevance of these results in animal search context, and the potential of Lévy walks in terms of adaptive behavior. ...|$|R

We measured the nanometre mechanical responses of the ear’s tympanal membrane to sound, finding that solitarious <b>animals</b> exhibit greater <b>displacement.</b> Finally, neural experiments signified that solitarious locusts have a relatively stronger response to high frequencies. The enhanced response to high frequency sounds in the nocturnally flying solitarious locusts suggests greater investment in detecting the ultrasonic echolocation calls of bats, to which they are more vulnerable than diurnally active gregarious locusts.

40|$|On-farm {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) of wastes and crops can potentially avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but incurs extensive environmental effects via carbon and nitrogen cycles and substitution of multiple processes {{within and outside}} farm system boundaries. Farm models were combined with consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) to assess plausible biogas and miscanthus heating pellet scenarios on dairy farms. On the large dairy farm, the introduction of slurry-only AD led to reductions in global warming potential (GWP) and resource depletion burdens of 14 % and 67 %, respectively, but eutrophication and acidification burden increases of 9 % and 10 %, respectively, assuming open tank digestate storage. Marginal GWP burdens per Mg dry matter (DM) feedstock codigested with slurry ranged from â�� 637 kg CO 2 e for food waste to + 509 kg CO 2 e for maize. Codigestion of grass and maize led to increased imports of concentrate feed to the farm, negating the GWP benefits of grid electricity substitution. Attributing grass-to-arable land use change (LUC) to marginal wheat feed production led to net GWP burdens exceeding 900 kg CO 2 e Mgâ�� 1 maize DM codigested. Converting the medium-sized dairy farm to a beef-plus-AD farm led to a minor reduction in GWP when grass-to-arable LUC was excluded, but a 38 % GWP increase when such LUC was attributed to marginal maize and wheat feed required for intensive compensatory milk production. If marginal animal feed is derived from soybeans cultivated on recently converted cropland in South America, the net GWP burden increases to 4099 kg CO 2 e Mgâ�� 1 maize DM codigested â�� equivalent to 55 Mg CO 2 e yrâ�� 1 per hectare used for AD-maize cultivation. We conclude that AD of slurry and food waste on dairy farms is an effective GHG mitigation option, but that the quantity of codigested crops should be strictly limited to avoid potentially large international carbon leakage via <b>animal</b> feed <b>displacement...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{reprogramming}} of the macrophage activation phenotype {{is considered}} {{important in the}} defense against consecutive infection with diverse infectious agents. However, {{in the setting of}} persistent, chronic infection the functional importance of macrophage-intrinsic adaptation to changing environments vs. recruitment of new macrophages remains unclear. Here we show that resident peritoneal macrophages expanded by infection with the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri altered their activation phenotype in response to infection with Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium in vitro and in vivo. The nematode-expanded resident F 4 / 80 high macrophages efficiently upregulated bacterial induced effector molecules (e. g. MHC-II, NOS 2) similarly to newly recruited monocyte-derived macrophages. Nonetheless, recruitment of blood monocyte-derived macrophages to Salmonella infection occurred with equal magnitude in co-infected <b>animals</b> and caused <b>displacement</b> of the nematode-expanded, tissue resident-derived macrophages from the peritoneal cavity. Global gene expression analysis revealed that although nematode-expanded resident F 4 / 80 high macrophages made an anti-bacterial response, this was muted as compared to newly recruited F 4 / 80 low macrophages. However, the F 4 / 80 high macrophages adopted unique functional characteristics that included enhanced neutrophil-stimulating chemokine production. Thus, our data provide important evidence that plastic adaptation of MΦ activation does occur in vivo, but that cellular plasticity is outweighed by functional capabilities specific to the tissue origin of the cell...|$|R
40|$|The Eph {{family of}} {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, are important regulators of axon guidance and cell migration {{in the developing}} nervous system. Inactivation of the EphA 4 gene results in axon guidance defects of the corticospinal tract, a major descending motor pathway that originates in the cortex and terminates {{at all levels of}} the spinal cord. In this investigation, we report that although the initial development of the corticospinal projection is normal through the cortex, internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, and medulla in the brain of EphA 4 deficient animals, corticospinal axons exhibit gross abnormalities when they enter the gray matter of the spinal cord. Notably, many corticospinal axons fail to remain confined to one side of the spinal cord during development and instead, aberrantly project across the midline, terminating ipsilateral to their cells of origin. Given the possible repulsive interactions between EphA 4 and one of its ligands, ephrinB 3, this defect could be consistent with a loss of responsiveness by corticospinal axons to ephrinB 3 that is expressed at the spinal cord midline. Furthermore, we show that EphA 4 deficient <b>animals</b> exhibit ventral <b>displacement</b> of the mature corticospinal termination pattern, suggesting that developing corticospinal axons, which may also express ephrinB 3, fail to be repelled from areas of high EphA 4 expression in the intermediate zone of the normal spinal cord. Taken together, these results suggest that the dual expression of EphA 4 on corticospinal axons and also within the surrounding gray matter is very important for the correct development and termination of the corticospinal projection within the spinal cord.

Experiments were performed in decerebrate cats {{to find out whether}} units which had the physiological characteristics of noradrenergic neurons (i. e., a slow and regular resting discharge and a typical response to a noxious stimulus consisting of a short burst of excitation followed by a silent period), received a convergent input from both labyrinth and neck receptors. Among 90 LC-complex units, 13 of which could be identified antidromically as coeruleospinal (CS) neurons following electrical stimulation of the spinal cord at T 12 -L 1, 52 (57. 8 %) responded to roll tilt of the animal and neck rotation at 0. 15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees. The responses were particularly related to the extreme <b>animal</b> and neck <b>displacements.</b> Most of these convergent neurons (43 / 52, i. e., 82. 7 %) showed reciprocal ('out of phase') responses to the two inputs, while only a few units (9 / 52, i. e., 17. 3 %) showed parallel ('in phase') responses. Moreover, the majority of the 'out of phase' units showed an increased discharge during side-up animal tilt and side-down neck rotation. These predominant response patterns were just opposite to those of the vestibulospinal (VS) neurons projecting to the same segments of the spinal cord. The response characteristics of the LC-complex neurons to combined neck and vestibular inputs elicited during head rotation usually corresponded to those predicted by a vectorial summation of the individual neck and labyrinth responses, as shown for the VS neurons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nature of intrinsic musculo-skeletal adaptations resulting from experimental alteration of the orofacial environment. A new occlusal configuration was devised which modified oral sensory stimuli, subsequently prompting anterior positioning of the mandible of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during functional jaw movements at four defined stages of maturation. Specific skeletal, dental, and neuromuscular adaptations were studied and interrelated by means of serial electromyography, serial cephalometric radiography with metallic implants, and microscopic analysis. The study was divided into two time periods. During the 13 -week control period, normal growth data were gathered from the four age groups. During the 13 -week experimental period, specific neuromuscular and skeletal alterations caused by the experimental conditions were identified. Postural activity in the muscles of mastication and presumably the postural position of the mandible were altered by the induced changes in the oral environment. The superior head of the lateral pterygoid gradually increased in activity, first during functional movements and then during the maintenance of mandibular postural position. The superior head appeared to function as a principal forward positioner of the mandible. This activity decreased or disappeared by the end of the experiment. At the end of the experimental period, ten of the twelve experimental monkeys demonstrated an anteroposterior alteration in molar relationship. No single adaptive process could be isolated and identified as the sole cause of any effective alteration in maxillomandibular relationship at any age level. Rather, each resulting relationship was the composite of specific complementary (and occasionally antagonistic) adaptations throughout the craniofacial complex. Mandibular skeletal adaptations occurred primarily in the infant and juvenile animals in which the extent and direction of growth at the condyle were altered. Dentitional adjustments in the mandible were most notable in the adolescent and adult animals. In the nasomaxillary area a decrease in the vertical displacement of the maxillary complex was noted in all but three of the experimental <b>animals.</b> Horizontal <b>displacement</b> of the maxillary complex and the drift pattern of the maxillary dentition were also affected, but the expression of this effect was variable. After 13 weeks, little histologic evidence of physiologic or pathologic responses to the induced protrusive function was evident in the sacrificed animals. These histologic findings were consistent with past studies which suggest that the adult temporomandibular joint was stable and resistant while the growing articulation was responsive to functional changes. The results of this study further indicated that a chronologic correlation existed between the occurrence and disappearance of altered neuromuscular function and the re-establishment of skeletal balance. As skeletal balance was restored through specific structural adaptations, the need for compensatory muscle function was reduced. Further, the nature and extent of the specific skeletal and dental adaptations depended upon the level of maturation of the animal...|$|R

The Ogiek tribe {{has been described}} as a peaceful group of people who specialize in cultivating honeybees, but will grow beans and potatoes if needed. The Ogiek subsist on animals that are only in abundance in the forest. Once the tribe notices a decline in population of a particular animal due to hunting, the Ogiek will practice [...] "self-imposed conservation" [...] by raising sheep and goats for food. The animals that are killed are for their use only and the Ogiek do not participate in the bush meat market. They are regarded as [...] "the best imaginable conservators of land". The first attempt to displace the Ogiek people was as early as the 1900s, when British settlers attempted to clear out the forest areas for tea plantations. Through the Forest Act of 1957 and the Wildlife Conservation Act of 1977, governments have continuously displaced the Ogiek for forest conservation and they were often moved to lands that were unfertile and useless to their customary lifestyle of bee production and <b>animal</b> hunting. This <b>displacement</b> caused many of the Ogiek to be homeless, in poverty, and suffered from sicknesses and their life expectancy declined from sixty to forty-six years. In June 2005, it was issued to stop the evictions through High Court order, but was later appealed five months later. During the case, it was emphasized that the Ogiek were not fit to inhabit the Mau Forest, yet the courts failed to mention the destruction that was taking place due to illegal, massive logging operations. Presently, ecologists and hydrologists are now giving credit to what the Ogiek have been saying for years; that Kenya forests are the main suppliers of water for the nation and if not preserved, will result is massive starvations and death. Already Kenya's forests have started to decline.|$|R
40|$|Purpose P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an efflux protein found amongst other {{locations}} in the blood–brain barrier. It is important to investigate the effect of Pgp modulation on clinically used brain tracers, because brain uptake of the tracer can be altered by blocking of the Pgp efflux transporter. The function of Pgp can be blocked with cyclosporin A. Methods We investigated the effect of cyclosporin A administration on the biodistribution of [123 I]R 91150 in rodents, {{and the effect of}} Pgp blocking on the quality of multipinhole μSPECT imaging with [123 I]R 91150. The influence of increasing doses of cyclosporin A on the brain uptake of [123 I]R 91150 was investigated in NMRI mice. A biodistribution study with [123 I]R 91150 was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with cyclosporin A and not pretreated. Brain uptake of [123 I]R 91150 after cyclosporin A injection was compared to the brain uptake in untreated <b>animals,</b> and a <b>displacement</b> study with ketanserin was performed in both groups. A multipinhole μSPECT brain imaging study was also performed using a Milabs U-SPECT-II camera in male Sprague-Dawley rats. To exclude the effect of possible metabolites, a metabolite study was also performed. Results At the highest cyclosporin A dose (50 mg/kg), a sevenfold increase in brain radioactivity concentration was observed in NMRI mice. Also, a dose-response relationship was established between the dose of cyclosporin A and the brain uptake of [123 I]R 91150 in mice. Compared to the control group, a five-fold increase in [123 I]R 91150 radioactivity concentration was observed in the brain of Sprague-Dawley rats after cyclosporin A treatment (50 mg/kg). Radioactivity concentration in the frontal cortex increased from 0. 24 ± 0. 0092 to 1. 58 ± 0. 097 % injected dose per gram of tissue after treatment with cyclosporin A (at the 1 -h time-point). Blood radioactivity concentrations did not increase to the same extent. The cortical activity was displaced by administration of ketanserin. A metabolite study confirmed that there was no increased metabolism of [123 I]R 91150 due to cyclosporin A. The visual quality of multipinhole μSPECT images with [123 I]R 91150 in Sprague-Dawley rats improved markedly after cyclosporin A pretreatment. Conclusion From the results obtained in the biodistribution studies, it can be concluded that [123 I]R 91150 is a substrate for Pgp in rodents. A relationship between the administered dose of cyclosporin A and the increase in [123 I]R 91150 brain radioactivity concentration was established. The overall quality of our multipinhole μSPECT images with [123 I]R 91150 in rats improved markedly after pretreatment of the animals with cyclosporin A...|$|R
40|$|Scientists {{agree that}} {{diseases}} in dairy cattle production lead to big financial losses. But until {{now they are}} not sure about the influence of specific diseases on the amount of the costs. Aim of this thesis was to show solutions how to calculate these losses more exactly by use of computerised support of a herd software. The question arose which key figures would therfore be required and how these figures were to rate financially to describe potential losses sufficiently. Furthermore, this thesis also addressed the question on which comparison basis these calculations shall be made. For this purpose the results of diseased cows were opposed to those of healthy animals and to the results {{of the rest of the}} herd. As management software the program "Herde" by DSP-Agrosoft was used. The necessary input data were generated by the practical part of this thesis which took place from July 2005 to March 2006 in a dairy farm in Brandenburg, Germany. The calculation of the economic losses was limited to the analysis of the key figures affected by diseases which could be benchmarked monetarily: milk yield, empty period, insemination index and rates of culling. It turned out that these diseases analysed consistently led to losses in production. By examination of the results, the following open issues must be considered: - The costs of the veterinarian remained unconsidered because of internal software reasons. Accordingly, the calculated losses due to diseases in fact are much higher than reported. - In the group of the diseased cattle multiple diseases occurred in many cases. Therefore it was not possible to consider a single disease on its own. - The calculated losses are based on a calculatory approach, fluctuating from production to production and from year to year (e. g. milk price). During the data collection period 657 cows calved. 227 of these cows were first-calf heifers. The economic losses for the first-calf heifers were much lower than for cows with two or more lactations. The assumption was verified that diseases have a greater negative economic effect on old cows than on young ones. For first-calf heifers retention of placenta led to the highest economic loss, 580 euros, referring to costs for a single animal. The endometritis-losses for single animals with 178 euros were not so high. However, multiplied with the number of diseased cows, endometritis led to a loss of profit for the whole stock (23. 670 euros) and therefore had the highest impact. Endometritis was followed by retention of placenta (16. 820 euros), mastitis (15. 870 euros) and diseases of the claws (15. 400 euros). Concerning heifers, metabolic diseases consistently led to losses over 500 euros per heifer. In contrast, on basis of the whole stock, abomasal displacement with 6. 038 euros had a higher impact. For cows with two or more lactations mastitis was the disease with the highest losses. In the group of cows suffering from mastitis at least once the economic loss was 669 euros per animal. Extrapolated for all diseased animals, losses for production were 165. 912 euros. Accordingly, this farm had to pay 106. 362 euros for cows with endometritis. This translates into loss of profit of 622 euros for a single animal. The third highest losses for the farm were diseases of claws with 87. 165 euros. Based on a single <b>animal,</b> abomasal <b>displacement</b> with 1. 102 euros resulted in the highest loss. This was followed by ketosis with 906 euros and by cows suffering from mastitis at least three times with 851 euros per animal. The results concerning necessary key figures needed for an economic analysis in a dairy farm are as follows: - Economic losses can be specified by using key-figures only. - For economic analyses, withdrawal periods because of drug use must always be included. This will lead to a different economic result. - Additional days of empty period should be included in the cost calculation rather than using a fixed value. It rather makes sense to define the generated cost relative to milk production and maintenance of milk yield of the cow. - In this analysis the difference between the slaughter value of an old cow and the acquisition price of a pregnant heifer was used as basis for fixing the costs of replacement, with 530 euros per loss. By this approach the difference of milk production between first-calf heifer and a cow in the third or fourth lactation is not considered. Concerning standards of comparison for the validation of losses, the analysis shows that the exclusive comparison of diseased and healthy cows as criteria is an appropriate benchmark for the assessment of lost profits but is not suitable for a problem-oriented analysis considering both criteria. The results of this analysis show that in the future it will be more and more necessary to implement such calculations during production. Only when the farmer, the consultant and the veterinarian are exactly informed about the detailed costs caused by disease, a meaningful economic and problem-oriented corrective action will be possible...|$|R
