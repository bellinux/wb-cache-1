2500|$|One of the {{short-term}} aging needs of wine {{is a period}} where the wine is considered [...] "sick" [...] due to the trauma and volatility of the bottling experience. During bottling the wine is exposed to some oxygen which causes a domino effect of chemical reactions with various components of the wine. The {{time it takes for}} the wine to settle down and have the oxygen fully dissolve and integrate with the wine is considered its period of [...] "bottle shock". During this time the wine could taste drastically different from how it did prior to bottling or how it will taste after the wine has settled. While many modern bottling lines try to treat the wine <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible and utilize inert gases to minimize the amount of oxygen exposure, all wine goes through some period of bottle shock. The length of this period will vary with each individual wine.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} in July 2008 that Matsumoto was dating then 25-year-old tarento Ihara Rin. In {{the evening of}} May 17, 2009, {{it was announced that}} Matsumoto's official bachelorhood had ended with a secret marriage ceremony between himself and the aforementioned Ihara. Ihara, a former weather announcer for the Japanese news program [...] "ズームイン!! Super" [...] (Zoom In!! Super) is nineteen years Matsumoto's junior, and apparently became pregnant by Matsumoto, prompting the marriage. The announcement of the marriage came via fax by Matsumoto's managing organization to several media outlets, including a personal message by Matsumoto himself: [...] "My partner will become an average citizen [...] and is currently pregnant. As this is a delicate time, I would like this to be dealt with <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible. It would be best to hold a press conference, however this situation is awkward and I will refrain from doing so." [...] The original faxed announcement did not contain details on Matsumoto's wife; however it has become widely known that his new partner is Ihara.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's {{nothing to}} report here," [...] the young woman answered. But the grey girl had slipped <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> past <b>as</b> though {{she had been the}} very spirit of adventure.|$|R
60|$|She echoed me, {{not like}} a living woman, but like a {{creature}} moved by machinery. She went on sweeping all the time. I took away the broom <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and <b>as</b> kindly as I could.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Nelly, raise those lower boughs <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and <b>as</b> {{carefully}} as you can. I will push the canoe under. I don't think the sharpest Indian {{will be able}} to take up our track now." ...|$|R
60|$|Although Mike {{carried out}} his {{suggestion}} <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> he could, Desmond almost fainted with pain.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the boys}} did this <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> they could, a groan showed how great was the agony.|$|E
60|$|Some one--and Kate {{knew the}} {{peculiar}} sound of Mrs. Lacy's crape--was moving the bed-clothes <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> she could.|$|E
6000|$|I {{struggled}} against {{the memories of}} the past, and spoke to her--God knows <b>as</b> <b>gently,</b> if not <b>as</b> happily, as in the bygone time! ...|$|R
6000|$|Honor, <b>as</b> lovingly and <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible, {{spoke to}} Phoebe. The girl's {{eyes filled with}} tears, {{but it was in}} an almost well-pleased tone that she said, 'Dear mamma, I always knew she felt it.' ...|$|R
60|$|If {{it should}} so happen that the bear neither heard you, saw you, or smelt you, {{you might see}} this great beast fondling her young ones, and licking their fur <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and tenderly <b>as</b> a cat with her kittens.|$|R
60|$|Marcia thereupon {{wrote out}} a reply to that effect, Jocelyn helping her {{to shape the}} phrases <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
6000|$|MILLER: [...] "Well, well, {{be quiet}} now. Ladies, I think you'd better sit down--and <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible. I wouldn't move about much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then on {{this place}} the Maid had sought: [...] And told, <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> could be, [...] The {{end of that}} sad Tragedy, [...] 1815.|$|E
6000|$|Gilbert gratefully {{caught at}} the invitation; and Mr. Ferrars {{gave him some}} advice as to his reading and self-discipline, {{speaking}} to him <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and tenderly <b>as</b> Albinia herself. Both lingered in case the other should have more to say, but at last Gilbert stood up, saying, ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Murphy {{dispersed}} the mob <b>as</b> <b>gently,</b> {{and with}} <b>as</b> few arrests, as possible,” the New York Times reported. “His {{statement that he}} would resign rather than order the shootings of looters was widely quoted, with approval in liberal circles and as {{a sure sign of}} anarchy by the right.” ...|$|R
60|$|Like two yellow-green augurs, {{wide and}} unblinking, the terrible eyes {{remained}} fixed upon Jane Clayton. The erect and majestic pose {{of the great}} frame shrank suddenly into a sinister crouch <b>as,</b> slowly and <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> one who treads on eggs, the devil-faced cat crept forward toward the girl.|$|R
60|$|And his arms, still {{vigorous}} {{in spite}} of fatigue and suffering, closed round Marguerite's poor, weary body, and lifted her <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> {{if she had been}} a feather.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Quinn was a matter-of-fact body; but {{her hard}} old face {{softened}} {{when he said}} that, and she kissed him good-night almost <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> if she'd been his mother.|$|E
60|$|The doubt was so ugly {{that it must}} be solved; {{and when}} she had got the poor thing safe into her bedroom she alluded to it <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> she could.|$|E
6000|$|For {{an instant}} there {{rose to his}} lips some faded {{compliment}} about his time not being wasted, but it expired before the simple sincerity of her look. She stood there <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> serious <b>as</b> the angel of disinterestedness, {{and it seemed to}} him he should insult her by treating her words as a bait for flattery. [...] "I shall start in a day or two," [...] he answered, [...] "but I won't promise you not to come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|So Ealer {{took a seat}} on the bench, panting and breathless. The black phantom {{assumed the}} wheel without saying anything, steadied the waltzing steamer with a turn or two, and then stood at ease, coaxing her a little to this side and then to that, <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and <b>as</b> sweetly as if the time had been noonday. When Ealer {{observed}} this marvel of steering, he wished he had not confessed! He stared, and wondered, and finally said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Altogether," [...] she said, [...] "and {{certainly}} I {{would rather}} {{know nothing about}} it. But mind, Cuthbert, you must do {{what you think is}} right and best without any question about me. If you have been wronged you must right yourself, and I am sure that in doing so you will do it <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and kindly <b>as</b> possible." ...|$|R
60|$|McCoy smiled <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> he spoke. His {{smile was}} a caress, an embrace that {{surrounded}} the tired mate and sought to draw him into the quietude and rest of McCoy's tranquil soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Follow me, then, Sir Guest," [...] {{said the}} landlord, [...] "and tread <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> if eggs were under your foot, instead of deal boards. No man must know when or how you departed." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} door <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> he had opened it, and stood there glancing about him. A slow grin {{appeared}} upon his face, to be succeeded by an expression of serious resolve. For Steve was anxious.|$|E
60|$|Saying these words, I {{took her}} by the hand and made her sit close by me; then, {{breaking}} it to her <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and gradually <b>as</b> possible, I told her all that had happened at the red-brick house since the evening when she left the dinner-table, and we exchanged our parting look at the dining-room door.|$|R
60|$|Then Augusta, <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and nicely <b>as</b> she could, {{approached}} the question with Johnnie, {{who was sitting}} with {{his back against the}} hut, his battered countenance wearing a peculiarly ill-favored expression, probably owing {{to the fact that he}} was suffering from severe pain in his head, as a result of the debauch of the previous night.|$|R
6000|$|The {{cause of}} all this smiled--a {{dazzling}} smile though a faint one--that momentarily lit up the austere gloom {{of the room and}} its occupants. [...] "You must thank this gentleman, papa," [...] said she, languidly turning to her father, [...] "for his kindness and his trouble. He has carried me here <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and <b>as</b> carefully as if I were a child." [...] Seeing symptoms of a return of Jeff's distress in his coloring face, she added softly, as if to herself, [...] "It's a great thing to be strong--a greater thing to be strong AND gentle." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was Catherine's {{wish that}} there should be no {{violence}} about her save the beating of her heart, which she could not help; and she went on, <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible, [...] "Will you promise to come to-morrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, child," [...] I said to her, <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> I could. [...] "Go pack, {{and quit}} this home of misery. And be easy. For if any man in Mondolfo {{attempts}} to hasten your going, he shall reckon with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no mistake}} this time," [...] the mate said, as the boom {{which had been}} hanging {{amidships}} slowly swung over to port. [...] "It's somewhere about the quarter that we expected it from, and coming <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> a lamb." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Grownup Noise is an American indie-folk {{rock band}} from Boston, Massachusetts that {{was formed in}} 2005 by {{songwriter}} / guitarist Paul Hansen and bassist Adam Sankowski. Known for their songwriting and attempts {{to bridge the gap}} between Americana and indie music, their music has been difficult to define. The A.V. Club wrote in August 2009 that “The Grownup Noise’s best asset however, is the songwriting, with lines of love and the changing seasons coming out <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> and colorful <b>as</b> the music itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|At 2102 km2, {{it is one}} of {{the largest}} {{national}} parks in Norway. It is also one of the most varied, since it includes both alpine mountain formations with glacier tongues, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> sloping mountain plateaus and forested valleys. The national park encompasses parts of the Saltfjellet mountain range. The Svartisen glacier is a central part of the park. There are also many Sami cultural landmarks within the park.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing a {{performance}} of the work by the New York Philharmonic, Zachary Woolfe of The New York Times described it as [...] "the product of a mature master, working with more confidence and patience on a larger canvas. The chorus’s hypnotic incantations have the undergirding of a glistening orchestral landscape, sometimes swaying, sometimes blooming." [...] He continued: At one point, a passionate cello solo becomes a duet with an oboe, which then gets a layer of enigmatic percussion before the other strings come in, <b>as</b> <b>gently</b> lyrical <b>as</b> any Mahler slow movement. Later, ethereal notes in the chorus are punctuated by firm string downbeats, like exhalations, that build to loud grandeur, then immediately recede, before a swirling, swinging climax driven on by an undercurrent of ba-bum heartbeat rhythm.|$|R
