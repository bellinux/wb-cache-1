25|$|The {{physical}} examination {{of an individual}} with <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> involves auscultation of the heart to listen for the murmur of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The murmur of chronic <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left sternal border.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the cause of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> is often due to the aortic root {{dilation}} (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation {{is the most common}} cause of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in developed countries. Additionally, <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> the main causes are infective endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (AI) {{occurs in}} half to two-thirds of {{ascending}} aortic dissections, and {{the murmur of}} <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur {{is dependent on the}} blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of hypotension.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Dominic John Corrigan, 1st Baronet (2 December 1802 - 1 February 1880), was an Irish physician, {{known for}} his {{original}} observations in heart disease. The abnormal [...] "collapsing" [...] pulse of <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> is named Corrigan's pulse after him.|$|R
30|$|In adults {{presenting}} with <b>aortic</b> or mitral <b>insufficiency</b> {{responsible for}} cardiogenic shock, the valve {{should be replaced}} without delay (strong agreement).|$|R
50|$|An {{aortic valve}} repair will realistically be {{possible}} {{in the absence of}} relevant calcification or shrinking (retraction) of the aortic valve. Thus, congenital aortic stenosis may be treated by aortic valve repair. In acquired aortic stenosis valve replacement will be the only realistic option. In most instances aortic valve repair will be performed for <b>aortic</b> regurgitation (<b>insufficiency).</b> <b>Aortic</b> valve repair may also be performed in the treatment of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection if either aneurysm or dissection involve the aorta close to the valve. The need for surgery on the aortic valve (including repair procedures) is indicated through objective criteria and the presence of symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{may be a}} late sequela {{of cardiac}} surgery. About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection {{have a history of}} open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic valve replacement for <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> are at particularly high risk because <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta. This can cause dilatation and weakening of the walls of the ascending aorta.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> In acute AI, {{as may be}} {{seen with}} acute {{perforation}} of the aortic valve due to endocarditis, {{there will be a}} sudden increase in the volume of blood in the left ventricle. The ventricle is unable to deal with the sudden change in volume. The filling pressure of the left ventricle will increase. This causes pressure in the left atrium to rise, and the individual will develop pulmonary edema. Severe acute <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is considered a medical emergency. There is a high mortality rate if the individual does not undergo immediate surgery for aortic valve replacement.|$|E
25|$|While diastolic blood {{pressure}} is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, systolic {{blood pressure}} generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see systolic pressures diminish. <b>Aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.|$|E
40|$|Wegener's {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} disease of unknown etiology, {{characterized by a}} granulomatous-necrotizing general vasculitis. Cardiac involvement {{in the form of}} aortic pathology is not frequent. We report a case of Wegener's granulomatosis which required prosthetic aortic valve replacement for <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency.</b> Microscopic examination of the valve demonstrated histopathology typical of Wegener's disease...|$|R
40|$|Major {{surgery in}} a patient with {{pancytopenia}} might be associated with increased surgical risks, especially for bleeding and infection. A 66 -yr-old man {{was admitted to the}} hospital due to shortness of breath. His dyspnea was classified by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) as functional class III. Prior to admission, he had a 5 -yr history of medical management for idiopathic aplastic anemia. The severity of aplastic anemia of the patient was graded as non-severe aplastic anemia. Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular function and severe aortic valve regurgitation (grade IV) with left ventricular end diastolic dimension measuring 87 mm. Because of dyspnea and echocardiographically documented <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency,</b> the patient underwent elective aortic valve replacement. Although extracorporeal circulation for valve operations might be associated with aggravation of impaired blood cell function, the patient recovered from surgery uneventfully. Here, we report a successful cardiac surgery with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass {{in a patient}} with severe <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> and concomitant idiopathic aplastic anemia...|$|R
30|$|Aortic {{aneurysm}} {{complicated by}} acute dissection or <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> {{is associated with}} decreased survival (on average 1.1  years) [41]. The standard therapy, high-dose oral steroids (40 – 60  mg daily) for 1 – 2  years, results in rapid improvement but a high relapse rate. Unlike TA, additional immunosuppressive therapy {{does not affect the}} course of the disease, but the approach to revascularisation is similar to TA [1, 48].|$|R
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (AI), {{also known}} as aortic {{regurgitation}} (AR), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{increased}} stroke {{volume of the}} left ventricle due to volume overload, an ejection systolic 'flow' murmur may also be present when auscultating the same aortic area. Unless there is concomitant aortic valve stenosis, the murmur should not start with an ejection click.There may also be an Austin Flint murmur, a soft mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apical area, it appears when regurgitant jet from the severe <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> renders partial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet.Peripheral physical signs of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{are related to the}} high pulse pressure and the rapid decrease in blood pressure during diastole due to blood returning to the heart from the aorta through the incompetent aortic valve, although the usefulness of some of the eponymous signs has been questioned: Phonocardiograms detect AI by having electric voltage mimic the sounds the heart makes.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{hypotension}} at {{presentation is}} a grave prognostic indicator. It is {{usually associated with}} pericardial tamponade, severe <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the brachiocephalic artery (supplying the right arm) or the left subclavian artery (supplying the left arm).|$|E
40|$|Among 304 {{cases of}} aortic valvulopathies studied for {{surgical}} selection, {{the authors have}} found {{a high incidence of}} conduction disturbances (16 % in aortic stenosis and 18, 4 % in aortic regurgitation). The conduction defects are mostly intraventricular among stenosis isolated or associated to regurgitation and mostly atrio-ventricular among pure <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiencies.</b> The highest incidence (30 %) being found in patients with bacterial endocarditis acute or healed. The incidence of conduction disturbances increases with age, with the presence of valvular calcifications, of left ventricular strain or failure, of coronary insufficiency and angina [...] . practically with the duration and the severity of the valvular disease. Surgical risk is heavier and natural prognosis poorer in valvulopathies with conduction disturbances. But these disturbances never contraindicates surgery : it is sometimes necessary to insert a pacemaker with or without valvular replacement mostly in aortic stenosis with infrahisian conduction defects. During hemodynamic investigation of such cases one must be ready to stimulate the heart, particularly during right heart catheterization of patients with complete left bundle branch block...|$|R
40|$|An {{organism}} resembling Corynebacterium striatum {{was isolated}} from the blood of a patient with acute <b>aortic</b> valvular <b>insufficiency</b> and no history of valvular heart disease. At autopsy, histopathologic examination of the aortic valve revealed pleomorphic gram-positive bacilli and destruction of valvular tissue. Our isolate differed from other nondiphtherial corynebacteria, including the type strain of C. striatum (ATCC 6940), {{in its ability to}} reduce nitrite.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{echocardiography}} {{was used}} to make the anatomic diagnosis of aortico-left ventricular tunnel in a 1 day old infant. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography allowed directional flow to be determined within the tunnel. The findings were confirmed by cardiac catheterization and by direct visualization at the time of surgical repair. <b>Aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> was excluded before and after surgery using pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The anatomy and physiology of aortico-left ventricular tunnel can thus be documented using noninvasive techniques...|$|R
25|$|As of 2007, the American Heart Association {{no longer}} {{recommends}} antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis before certain procedures {{in patients with}} <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis before gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures is no longer recommended for any patient with valvular disease. Cardiac stress test is useful in identifying individuals that may be best suited for surgical intervention. Radionuclide angiography is recommended and useful when the systolic wall stress is calculated and combined to the results.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is also used}} for the detection and assessment of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. An MRI examination of the aorta produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the aorta, allowing the physician to determine {{the location of the}} intimal tear and the involvement of branch vessels, and to locate any secondary tears. It is a noninvasive test, does not require the use of iodinated contrast material, and can detect and quantitate the degree of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> If the {{individual}} survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left ventricular filling pressures will revert to normal and {{the individual}} will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase.Some individuals enter this decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic valve replacement prior to this decompensation phase.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of cases involving clinically significant aortitis result from Takayasu's disease, syphilis, and mycotic aneurysms, although aortitis may occur {{as a part of}} the clinical manifestation in other diseases of known and unknown etiology. Syphilitic aortitis can be treated successfully if an accurate diagnosis is made early and if appropriate antibiotic therapy is instituted. Untreated or treated inadequately, late cardiovascular complications can occur, namely, aortic aneurysm, <b>aortic</b> valvular <b>insufficiency</b> and coronary osteal stenosis. Surgical treatment should be considered when any of these late complications become manifest...|$|R
50|$|Left {{ventricular}} afterload {{is affected}} by various disease conditions. Hypertension increases the afterload, since the LV has {{to work harder to}} overcome the elevated arterial peripheral resistance and decreased compliance. Aortic valve diseases like <b>aortic</b> stenosis and <b>insufficiency</b> also increase the afterload, whereas mitral valve regurgitation decreases the afterload.|$|R

She developed moderate to severe mitral and <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency,</b> requiring semi-urgent double-valve replacement. The initial diagnosis of rheumatic valve disease was refuted on histological examination of the valves {{due to the lack of}} typical calcification and neovascularization. Valvular heart disease is associated with the use of dopamine agonists {{for the treatment}} of Parkinson’s disease and obesity, typically at much higher doses...|$|R
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or aortic {{regurgitation}} can {{be treated}} either medically or surgically, depending on the acuteness of presentation, the symptoms and signs associated with the disease process, {{and the degree of}} left ventricular dysfunction. Surgical treatment in asymptomatic patients has been recommended if the ejection fraction falls to 50% or below, in the face of progressive and severe left ventricular dilatation, or with symptoms or abnormal response to exercise testing. For both groups of patients, surgery before the development of worsening ejection fraction/LV dilatation is expected {{to reduce the risk of}} sudden death, and is associated with lower peri-operative mortality. Also, surgery is optimally performed immediately in acute cases.|$|E
25|$|Medical therapy {{of chronic}} <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> that is stable and {{asymptomatic}} {{involves the use}} of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nifedipine, and hydralazine in improving left ventricular wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the afterload so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and left ventricular pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very strenuous activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>aortic</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during systole regurgitates back into the left ventricle during diastole, there is decreased effective forward flow in AI.|$|E
50|$|About 40% {{of people}} with AS will also {{experience}} inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye, causing eye pain, redness, floaters and sensitivity to light. This {{is thought to be}} due to the association that both AS and uveitis have with the inheritance of the HLA-B27 antigen. Inflammation of the prostate occurs with increased frequency in men. Cardiovascular involvement may include inflammation of the aorta, <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> or disturbances of the heart's electrical conduction system. Lung involvement is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the upper portion of the lung.|$|R
40|$|Aortico-left {{ventricular}} tunnel (ALVT) {{is a rare}} {{congenital anomaly}} presenting abnormal connection between the ascending aorta and the left ventricle.

5000|$|Due to Syphilitic aortitis (a {{complication}} of tertiary syphilis) the aortic valve ring becomes dilated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the evolution of}} <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> (AI) after Park's central stitch in patients with severe, preoperative, native <b>aortic</b> valve <b>insufficiency.</b>  Methods: We retrospectively studied 71 continuous flow LVAD patients between January 2004 and December 2010. Four patients with AI≥ 3 / 4 were treated with a central stitch. An intensive {{review of the literature}} was performed to debate the use of the central stitch in this population.  Results: The AI at baseline (AI = 2. 75 ± 0. 5) and AI at last measurement (AI = 0. 75 ± 0. 65) is statistically different after central stitch (p< 0. 05) with mean follow up of 198. 25 (± 146. 70) days. Total cross clamp-time during the placement of the stitch was 15. 5 minutes (± 13. 062). CVA was not diagnosed in our cohort.  Conclusions: Park's central stitch can be successfully performed on patients with severe native AI (≥ 3 / 4) with good long-term results. Short ischemic time and simple application of the stitch are the biggest advantages. Due to the progression of AI in longstanding LVAD, the central stitch may be beneficial for LVAD in destination therapy. Since this is a small group of patients and also an early experience, more cases will be necessary to confirm these positive results. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Quadricuspid {{aortic valve}} {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} malformation of the aortic valve. Its diagnosis is often missed even {{with the use of}} transthoracic echocardiogram.
