5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over large areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach to infinity. The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; {{there is little evidence}} of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E

25|$|The United States federal {{government}} (as {{opposed to the}} states) has a variant on a common law system.

25|$|Debate {{continues}} {{within a}} framework assuming that many Brittonic-speakers shifted to English, for example over whether {{at least some}} Germanic-speaking peasant-class immigrants must have been involved {{to bring about the}} language-shift; what legal or social structures (such as enslavement or apartheid-like customs) might have promoted the high status of English; <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> how slowly Brittonic (and British Latin) disappeared in different regions.|$|E

25|$|Passive sonar on {{vehicles}} {{is usually}} severely limited because of noise {{generated by the}} vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.|$|E

In some caves, changes of depth of the cave along the dive route will constrain decompression depths, and gas mixtures and decompression schedules can be tailored to take this into account.|$|E
25|$|ROF Cardiff, which {{closed in}} 1997, had been {{involved}} in nuclear weapons programmes since 1961.

ROF Burghfield was a former Filling Factory, opened in 1942, and run as an Agency Factory, by Imperial Tobacco, to fill Oerlikon 20 mm ammunition.|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In {{the latter part of}} the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> defining their meaning.|$|E

50|$|On Saturday 8 May 2004, the {{prototype}} was dropped from 2.4 km by a helicopter <b>and</b> landed <b>precisely</b> <b>and</b> without incident after a GPS-guided 90 second glide. The test {{was conducted at}} the North European Aerospace Test range in Kiruna, 1,240 km north of Stockholm, Sweden. The primary {{aim of the test}} was to assess the glider potential of the craft. No subsequent tests were reported.|$|R
25|$|This was {{followed}} by similar experiments on Perhapsatron and Columbus, demonstrating the same problems. When instabilities developed, areas of enormous electrical potential developed, rapidly accelerating protons in the area. These sometimes collided with neutrons in the plasma or the container walls, ejecting them through neutron spallation. These were the same sorts of instabilities seen in earlier machines, <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> the problem Cockcroft had mentioned during the press releases, but in ZETA they were much more powerful and the neutrons appeared to be fusion related until further work demonstrated their nature. The promise of stabilised pinch disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Captain Turner gave {{evidence}} in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that {{up until the}} time of the sinking he had {{no reason to think that}} zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of the Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{following}} forging processes can be performed at various temperatures; however, they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature is above the material's recrystallization temperature it is deemed hot forging; if the temperature is below the material's recrystallization temperature but above 30% of the recrystallization temperature (on an absolute scale) it is deemed warm forging; if below 30% of the recrystallization temperature (usually room temperature) then it is deemed cold forging. The main advantage of hot forging {{is that it can}} be done more quickly <b>and</b> <b>precisely,</b> and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process. Cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece.|$|E
