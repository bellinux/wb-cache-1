40|$|Background: A wide pulse {{pressure}} (PP) {{can provide}} important risk assessment information about myocardial infarction, carotid artery atherosclerosis, and global cardiovascular risk. Ambulatory pulse pressure (APP) {{does not have}} a well-known prognostic value in hypertensive patients. Methods: To evaluate the relationship among high APP, atrial volumes, and cardiac function, an observational study was performed on 108 untreated nonelderly hypertensive patients (mean age 54. 23 +/- 7. 12). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, Doppler and echocardiographic measurements of systolic, diastolic function, left and right atrial volumes, left ventricular mass index and dimensions, were performed in subjects with both clinic and APP > 60 mmHg (<b>APP</b> 1 <b>Group).</b> A control group of hypertensive selected subjects with both clinic and APP < 60 mmHg was chosen (<b>APP</b> 2 <b>Group).</b> Results: The <b>APP</b> 1 <b>group</b> showed left atrial volume enlargement, high left ventricular mass index, and impaired diastolic function. A positive correlation was found in the <b>APP</b> 1 <b>group</b> results among left ventricular end diastolic diameter (r = 0. 39, P < 0. 01), left atrial volume (0. 38, P < 0. 05), and left ventricular mass index (r = 0. 33, P < 0. 05); clinic PP showed a statistically significant correlation with left atrial volume, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and left ventricular mass index only in the <b>APP</b> 1 <b>group.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest that elevated APP can be considered an effective predictor of cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects.

40|$|Background. We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of a}} smartphone application that analyzes and judges the optimal dosage of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for bowel preparation. Methods. Patients were assigned to use the smartphone camera application (<b>app</b> <b>group)</b> or written instructions (non-app group). The smartphone camera application was programmed to analyze the bowel preparation quality and automatically determine the dosage of PEG from an analysis of stool images. In contrast, the non-app group consumed PEG solution according to the manual. Results. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel preparation based on blinded ratings using the Ottawa bowel preparation scale (OBPS). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean OBPS scores between the two groups (P= 0. 950). However, the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> consumed a lower dose of PEG than the non-app group (mean dosage (mL) : 3713. 2 [*]±[*] 405. 8 versus 3979. 2 [*]±[*] 102. 06, P= 0. 001). The <b>app</b> <b>group</b> (5 -point Likert scale; mean score 4. 37 [*]±[*] 0. 895) had high acceptance of the application. Conclusions.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of two inactivated vaccines containing the Apx toxins of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Hemopig(TM), Biokema, Lausanne, Switzerland and Porcilis(TM) APP, Intervet, Boxmeer, the Netherlands) was determined. Ten pigs were vaccinated twice with Hemopig(TM) and eight pigs with Porcilis(TM) App. Ten control animals were injected twice with a saline solution. Three {{weeks after the}} second vaccination, all pigs were endobronchially inoculated with 10 (5) colony-forming units (CFU) of an A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 9 strain. Increased respiratory rate and/or fever were observed in all vaccinated and control pigs after challenge. One pig of the Hemopig(TM) group and of the Porcilis(TM) <b>App</b> <b>group</b> died, whereas all pigs of the control group survived the challenge. Surviving pigs were killed at 7 days after challenge. The mean percentage of affected lung tissue was 34 % in the control group, 16 % in the Hemopig(TM) group, and 17 % in the Porcilis(TM) <b>App</b> <b>group.</b> A. pleuropneumoniae was isolated from the lungs of all 10 control animals, from 7 of the 10 animals vaccinated with Hemopig(TM) and from 5 of the 8 animals vaccinated,vith Porcilis(TM) App. The mean bacterial titres of the caudal lung lobes were 1. 4 x 10 (6) CFU/g in the control group, 1. 7 x 10 (3) CFU/g in the Hemopig(TM) group, and 4. 8 x 10 (3) CFU/g in the Porcilis(TM) <b>App</b> <b>group.</b> In both vaccinated groups {{the mean number of}} days with dyspnoea, the mean number of days with fever, the mean percentage of affected lung tissue, and the mean bacterial titre in the caudal lung lobes were significantly lower than in the control group, Significant differences between the two vaccinated groups were not observed.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{density of}} {{presynaptic}} markers of synaptic communication and plasticity, especially synaptophysin (SYP), is {{significantly correlated with}} cognitive decline and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), indicating that synaptic protection is an important therapeutic strategy for AD. This study aims to investigate the synaptic protective effects {{of a combination of}} several active components extracted from the Chinese herbs ginseng, epimedium, polygala and tuber curcumae (GEPT), in the brains of APPV 717 I transgenic mice. Methods Three-month-old APPV 717 I mice were arbitrarily divided into 10 groups (n[*]=[*] 12 per group) : APP groups receiving vehicle treatment for four or eight months (model groups), three dose groups of GEPT-treated mice for each treatment period, and donepezil-treated mice for each treatment period. Three-month-old C 57 BL/ 6 [*]J mice (n[*]=[*] 12) were also given vehicle for four or eight months (control groups). Vehicle, donepezil or GEPT were intragastrically administered. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis were used to assess protein expression in the hippocampal CA 1 region and ratios of SYP to β-actin levels in hippocampal tissue homogenate, respectively. Results Both IHC and Western blot revealed a decrease in SYP levels in the CA 1 region of 7 - and 11 -month-old APPV 717 I transgenic mice compared with the control groups, whereas SYP levels were increased in donepezil- and GEPT-treated transgenic mice compared with the <b>APP</b> <b>group.</b> There was {{a significant difference in the}} levels of SYP detected by IHC between the GEPT high-dose group and the <b>APP</b> <b>group</b> after 4 [*]months of treatment, and there were significant differences between all three GEPT groups and the <b>APP</b> <b>group</b> after 8 [*]months of treatment. Western blotting showed that the SYP protein–β-actin ratio was decreased in APP mice, while donepezil- and GEPT-treated transgenic mice showed increased trends in the SYP protein–β-actin ratios.

40|$|Background: Food {{waste is}} one of today’s {{greatest}} threats against sustainability. One {{of the most important}} reasons for food waste generation in developed countries is the un-willingness of many consumers to buy or consume sub-optimal foods. This study investigated whether an app can contribute to changing consumers’ attitudes towards sub-optimal foods and support consumers in reducing household food waste. Methods: The study involved 150 participants distributed over three intervention groups based on their sociodemographic characteristics. The app intervention was designed based on a brain storming session and group interviews. One group received a targeted app with a special focus on preventing waste of dairy products (full app), the other a more general version of the app (light app) and the third a printed version of the app (paper). The app’s effect on household food waste reduction was compared between the groups after three weeks through an evaluation survey. Results: People attributed low usefulness of the app for wasting less food and there was no effect observed effect on attitude towards sub-optimal foods. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two <b>app</b> <b>groups.</b> However, the paper group was more likely to find the app useful than both <b>app</b> <b>groups.</b> 49 % of participants in the <b>app</b> <b>groups</b> experienced technical issues. Nevertheless, 25 % of participants across all groups reported to have attained talking to friends or family about food waste during the intervention period. Conclusion: This study tested whether an app can support consumers in reducing household food waste. The current study provides no evidence that an app can support people in reducing household food waste. However, it might raise awareness. The limited effect can partly be attributed to technical issues and lack of desired features mentioned by interview informants. An app might be useful for wasting less food in households, but further development of the app is necessary to investigate this possibility further...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mobile apps can {{increase}} access to care, facilitate self-management, and improve adherence to treatment. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects 10 - 35 % of women and, currently, an app with instructions for pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is available as first-line treatment. A previous randomized controlled study {{demonstrated that the}} app benefitted symptom severity {{and quality of life}} (QoL); in this study we investigate the cost-effectiveness of the app. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the health economy of the app for treating SUI. Methods: This deterministic cost-utility analysis, with a 1 -year societal perspective, compared the app treatment with no treatment. Health economic data were collected alongside a randomized controlled trial performed in Sweden from March 2013 to October 2014. This study included 123 community-dwelling women participants of 18 years and above, with stress urinary incontinence >= 1 time per week. Participants were self-assessed with validated questionnaires and 2 -day leakage diaries, and then randomized to 3 months of treatment (<b>app</b> <b>group,</b> n= 62) or no treatment (controls, n= 61). The app focused on pelvic floor muscle training, prescribed 3 times daily. We continuously registered treatment delivery costs. Data were collected on each participant's training time, incontinence aids, and laundry at baseline and at a 3 -month follow-up. We measured quality of life with the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Quality of Life, and calculated the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Data from the 3 -month follow-up were extrapolated to 1 year for the calculations. Our main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared between app and control groups. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The mean age of participants was 44. 7 years (SD 9. 4). Annual costs were (sic) 547. 0 for the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> and (sic) 482. 4 for the control group. Annual gains in quality-adjusted life years for app and control groups were 0. 0101 and 0. 0016, respectively. Compared with controls, the extra cost per quality-adjusted life year for the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> ranged from -(sic) 2425. 7 to (sic) 14, 870. 6, which indicated greater gains in quality-adjusted life years at similar or slightly higher cost. Conclusions: The app for treating stress urinary incontinence is a new, cost-effective, first-line treatment with potential for increasing access to care in a sustainable way for this patient group...|$|E
40|$|Background: With the {{increasing}} availability of Smartphones and wearable tracking devices, {{it is now}} feasible and affordable to apply such mobile devices to delivering mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and intermittent fasting (IF) to lower blood pressure, as traditional MBSR and IF incur the burden of commuting to the intervention sites for the patients. Our study will develop and scientifically evaluate an MBSR app, an IF app and an MBSR + IF app {{in terms of their}} effectiveness for lowering blood pressure. We will further explore the possible interaction effect (synergistic effect) between MBSR and IF intervention: will improved mindfulness enhance patients’ adherence to the IF protocol? Methods: We will develop an MBSR app, an IF app, and an MBSR+IF app. We will then conduct an 8 -week randomized controlled trial with a factorial design to evaluate the efficacy of these new apps, especially the interaction effect between MBSR and IF. Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned to Group 1 (MBSR <b>app),</b> <b>Group</b> 2 (IF <b>app),</b> <b>Group</b> 3 (MBSR + IF app) or Group 4 (usual care). Discussion: This will be the first attempt to explore the impact of mindfulness intervention on the adherence of a behavioral intervention. Nevertheless, our protocol is limited in that the effectiveness of intermittent fasting on lowering blood pressure has not been supported by large-sample randomized controlled trials. Thus if there is no significant effectiveness we cannot determine whether it is due to the intermittent fasting intervention itself or it is due to the limit of smartphone as a vehicle...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a mobile app treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial, conducted 2013 - 2014 in Sweden. Community-dwelling adult women with ≥ 1 SUI episode/week recruited through our website and randomized to app treatment (n[*]=[*] 62) or control group (postponed treatment, n[*]=[*] 61). One participant from each group was lost to follow-up. Intervention was the mobile app Tät(®) with a treatment program focused on pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), and information about SUI and lifestyle factors. Primary outcomes, 3 months after randomization: symptom severity (International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence Short Form [ICIQ-UI SF]); and condition-specific quality of life (ICIQ Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life [ICIQ-LUTSqol]). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three women were included (mean age 44. 7), with moderate/severe SUI (97. 5 %, 120 / 123), mean ICIQ-UI SF score 11. 1 (SD 2. 8) and mean ICIQ-LUTSqol score 34. 4 (SD 6. 1) at baseline. At follow-up, the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> reported improvements in symptom severity (mean ICIQ-UI SF score reduction: 3. 9, 95 % confidence interval 3. 0 - 4. 7) and condition-specific quality of life (mean ICIQ-LUTSqol score reduction: 4. 8, 3. 4 - 6. 2) and the groups were significantly different (mean ICIQ-UI SF score difference: - 3. 2, - 4. 3 to - 2. 1; mean ICIQ-LUTSqol score difference: - 4. 6, - 7. 8 to - 1. 4).

MethodsThree-month-old APPV 717 I transgenic mice were randomly divided into ten groups (n= 12 per group) and intragastrically administrated vehicle or medicines: <b>APP</b> <b>group</b> was given 0. 5 % CMC, donepezil group was given donepezil (APP + D group) (0. 92 mg/kg− 1 · day− 1), and GEPT groups were given small dose of GEPT (APP+Gs group) (0. 075 g/kg− 1 · day− 1), medium dose (APP+Gm group) (0. 15 g/kg− 1 ·day− 1), and large dose (APP+Gl group) (0. 30 g/kg− 1 · day− 1) for 4 or 8 months, respectively. Three-month-old C 57 BL/ 6 J mice as vehicle controls (n= 12) were given 0. 5 % CMC for 4 or 8 months as well. The GSK- 3 β expression in the cortex of 7 - and 11 -month-old APPV 717 I transgenic mice with and without GEPT or donepezil treatment and normal C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were measured via Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. ResultsImmunohistochemistry analysis showed significant increase of GSK- 3 β in the cerebral cortex of 7 -month-old <b>APP</b> <b>group</b> (compare to control group P= 0. 003), while the GSK- 3 β expression of donepezil or GEPT group were all significantly decreased (Donepezil vs APP: P= 0. 041; Gl vs APP: P= 0. 049; Gm vs APP: P= 0. 029; Gh vs APP: P= 0. 036). Western blot analysis showed similar results. The densitometric measures of GSK- 3 β in APP mice increased significantly {{as compared with the}} control group (P= 0. 008). And the GSK- 3 β expression in donepezil and GEPT groups were all decreased. There was significant difference between Gh group or donepezil group and the control group (P= 0. 05). Similar findings were shown in the 11 -month-old mice in each group, except for greater decrease of GSK- 3 β in the GEPT group. ConclusionGEPT can effectively decrease the level of GSK- 3 β expression in the brain cortex of AP-PV 717 I transgenic mice, and such effect is more significant in 11 -month-old mice.

40|$|Introduction: {{with the}} {{introduction}} of regional trauma networks in England, ambulance clinicians have been required to make triage decisions relating to severity of injury, and appropriate destination for the patient, which may require ‘bypassing’ the nearest Emergency Department. A ‘Trauma Unit Bypass Tool’ is utilised in this process. The Major Trauma Triage tool smartphone application (App) is a digital representation of a tool, available for clinicians to use on their smartphone. Prior to disseminating the application, validity and performance against the existing paper-based tool was explored. Methods: a case-based study using clinical scenarios was conducted. Scenarios, with appropriate triage decisions, were agreed by an expert panel. Ambulance clinicians were assigned to either the paper-based tool or smartphone <b>app</b> <b>group</b> and asked to make a triage decision using the available information. The positive predictive value (PPV) of each tool was calculated. Results: the PPV of the paper tool was 0. 76 and 0. 86 for the smartphone app. User comments were mainly positive for both tools with no negative comments relating to the smartphone app. Conclusion: the smartphone app version of the Trauma Unit Bypass Tool performs at least as well as the paper version and can be utilised safely by pre-hospital clinicians in supporting triage decisions relating to potential major traum...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anxiety {{and mood}} {{disorders}} {{are the most}} common mental illnesses, peaking during adolescence and affecting approximately 25 % of Canadians aged 14 - 17 years. If not successfully treated at this age, they often persist into adulthood, exerting a great social and economic toll. Given the long-term impact, finding ways to increase the success and cost-effectiveness of mental health care is a pressing need. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for mood and anxiety disorders throughout the lifespan. Mental health technologies {{can be used to make}} such treatments more successful by delivering them in a format that increases utilization. Young people embrace technologies, and many want to actively manage their mental health. Mobile software apps have the potential to improve youth adherence to CBT and, in turn, improve outcomes of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to improve homework adherence in CBT for youth anxiety and/or depression. The objectives are to (1) design and optimize the usability of a mobile app for delivering the homework component of CBT for youth with anxiety and/or depression, (2) assess the app's impact on homework completion, and (3) implement the app in CBT programs. We hypothesize that homework adherence will be greater in the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> than in the no-app group. METHODS: Phase 1 : exploratory interviews will be conducted with adolescents and therapists familiar with CBT to obtain views and perspectives on the requirements and features of a usable app and the challenges involved in implementation. The information obtained will guide the design of a prototype. The prototype will be optimized via think-aloud procedures involving an iterative process of evaluation, modification, and re-evaluation, culminating in a fully functional version of the prototype that is ready for optimization in a clinical context. Phase 2 : a usability study will be conducted to optimize the prototype in the context of treatment at clinics that provide CBT treatment for youth with anxiety and/or depression. This phase will result in a usable app that is ready to be tested for its effectiveness in increasing homework adherence. Phase 3 : a pragmatic clinical trial will be conducted at several clinics to evaluate the impact of the app on homework adherence. Participants in the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> are expected to show greater homework completion than those in the no-app group. RESULTS: Phase 3 will be completed by September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The app will be a unique adjunct to treatment for adolescents in CBT, focusing on both anxiety and depression, developed in partnership with end users at every stage from design to implementation, customizable for different cognitive profiles, and designed with depression symptom tracking measures for youth made interoperable with electronic medical records...|$|E
40|$|In {{thirteen}} evaluation {{studies of}} Audio-Psycho-Phonology (APP) mainly positive results were reported. However, the intrinsic contribution of APP to these favourable outcomes is questioned, {{in view of}} underlying methodological problems. This investigation was planned to eliminate such design deficits and to effect a more rigorous evaluation of the APP approach {{on a group of}} anxious primary school pupils. Forty subjects from the primary school population of Potchefstroom were identified as anxious by the teaching staff. From this target group pupils were assigned to three groups: 10 pupils who completed an APP programme; 9 pupils who were subjected to an alternative therapy programme; and a non-intervention control group of 10 pupils. Control measures included determining pre-treatment group equivalence, controlling the integrity of both treatment programmes, and controlling the effect of therapist competence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given {{the global}} {{prevalence}} of insufficient physical activity (PA), effective interventions that attenuate age-related decline in PA levels are needed. Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, {{their impact on}} PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and {{little is known about}} what makes a good mHealth app. OBJECTIVE: The aim was {{to determine the effects of}} two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels. METHODS: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3 -arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14 - 17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8 -week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed design and narrative. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1 -mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps. RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n= 17), nonimmersive app intervention (n= 16), or the control group (n= 18). The mean age of participants was 15. 7 (SD 1. 2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61 %, 31 / 51) and 57 % (29 / 51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96 % (49 / 51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was - 28. 4 seconds shorter (95 % CI - 66. 5 to 9. 82, P=. 20) for the immersive <b>app</b> <b>group</b> and - 24. 7 seconds (95 % CI - 63. 5 to 14. 2, P=. 32) for the nonimmersive <b>app</b> <b>group.</b> No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity...|$|E

40|$|Background: E-health has the {{potential}} to facilitate implementation of effective measures to prevent sports injuries. Aim: We evaluated whether an interactive mobile application containing a proven effective exercise programme to prevent recurrent ankle sprains resulted in higher compliance as compared with regular written exercise materials. Methods: 220 athletes participated in this randomised controlled trial with a follow-up of 8 weeks; 110 athletes received a booklet explaining an 8 -week neuromuscular training programme; 110 athletes participated in the same programme in an interactive mobile App (Strengthen your ankle). The primary outcome was compliance with the exercise programme. Secondary outcome measure was the incidence density of self-reported recurrent ankle sprains. Results: The mean compliance to the exercise scheme was 73. 3 % (95 % CI 67. 7 % to 78. 1 %) in the <b>App</b> <b>group,</b> compared with 76. 7 % (95 % CI 71. 9 % to 82. 3 %) in the Booklet group. No significant difference in compliance was found between groups. The incidence densities of self-reported time-loss recurrences were not significantly different between both groups (HR 3. 07; 95 % CI 0. 62 to 15. 20). Summary: This study shows that the method of implementing the exercises by using an App or a Booklet does not lead to different compliance rates. New findings: The use of a mobile App or a Booklet lead to similar compliance and injury rates in the short term. Trial registration number: The Netherlands National Trial Register NTR 4027. The NTR is part of the WHO Primary Registries...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} a mobile-based bolus advisor app {{in comparison with the}} usual multiple daily injections (MDIs) in diabetic patients. Materials and Methods: In a nonrandomized, controlled clinical trial, 62 diabetic patients were selected to receive a 12 -week intensive glycemic control by either a mobile-based bolus advisor (app) or MDI in the usual manner. We compared mean blood glucose (BG) and HbA 1 c before and just after the treatment program. The data were analyzed using paired sample t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Fifty-six patients (30 cases and 26 controls) completed the study. The mean [standard deviation (SD) ] of BG was 220. 57 (43. 7) and 231. 5 (55) in the <b>app</b> <b>group</b> and control group, respectively. Mean BG decreased 38 mg/dL in the app and 16 mg/dL in the control group (P = 0. 001 and 0. 049 respectively). Changes of mean BG were different between the two groups significantly (P = 0. 039). HbA 1 c decreased from 8. 4 % to 7. 6 % in the case and from 8. 4 % to 8 % in the control group (P = 0. 001 and 0. 06, respectively). Changes of HbA 1 c were not different between the two groups (P = 0. 141). The mean episodes of hypoglycemia were not different between the groups significantly (P = 0. 108). Conclusion: In conclusion, this study revealed that mobile-based bolus advisors can reduce mean BG better in patients who are planned to have a tight glycemic control as a feasible and available method and may improve HbA 1 c in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent ankle sprains can {{be reduced}} by {{following}} a neuromuscular training (NMT) program via a printed Booklet or a mobile application. Regarding {{the high incidence of}} ankle sprains, cost-effectiveness regarding implementation can have a large effect on total societal costs. In this economic analysis, we evaluated whether the method of implementing a proven effective NMT program using an App or a Booklet resulted in differences in injury incidence rates leading to costs and hence to differences in cost-effectiveness. In total, 220 athletes with a previous ankle sprain were recruited for this randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of 12 months. Half of the athletes used the freely available "Strengthen your ankle" App and the other half received a printed Booklet. After the 8 -week program, athletes were questioned monthly on their recurrent injuries. Primary outcome measures were incidence density of ankle injury and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). During follow-up, 31 athletes suffered from a recurrent ankle sprain that led to costs resulting in a hazard ratio of 1. 13 (95 % CI: 0. 56 - 2. 27). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the <b>App</b> <b>group</b> in comparison with the Booklet group was € 361. 52. The CE plane shows that there was neither a difference in effects nor in costs between both intervention methods. This study showed that the method of implementing the NMT program using an App or a Booklet led to similar cost-effectiveness ratios and the same occurrence of recurrent injuries leading to costs. Both the App and the Booklet can be used to prevent recurrent ankle injuries, showing no differences in (cost-) effectiveness at 12 -month follow-up...|$|E
