500|$|In late 1861, the Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of Ridleyville, Pennsylvania, {{had written}} to Chase, proposing that some {{reference}} to God {{be placed on the}} coinage in that time of war, and on November20 of that year, Chase wrote to Mint Director Pollock, [...] "You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition." [...] Several mottoes were considered by Pollock, including [...] "God Our Trust" [...] and [...] "God and Our Country". Some of the patterns he sent Chase in December 1863 used [...] "God Our Trust", and he wrote of the design, [...] "the devices are beautiful and appropriate, and the motto on each such, as all who fear God and love their country, will approve." [...] He also sent pattern coins depicting George Washington; Chase responded to the letter, [...] "I approve your mottoes, only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR, so as to read OUR GOD <b>AND</b> <b>OUR</b> <b>COUNTRY.</b> And on that with the shield, it should be changed so as to read: IN GOD WE TRUST." [...] Pollock had been inspired by [...] "The Star Spangled Banner", a later stanza of which includes the line, [...] "And this be our motto, 'In God Is Our Trust'". Chase may have been influenced in his decision by the motto of his alma mater, Brown University, In Deo Speramus (In God We Hope).|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [...] The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [...] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [...] most happy circumstance {{of my life to}} be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>Country.</b>|$|E

Hart, already aware that the nomination was all but Mondale's after the final primaries, lobbied for the vice presidential slot on the ticket, claiming {{that he would do}} better than Mondale against President Ronald Reagan (an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points behind the president). While Hart was given serious consideration, Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro instead. [...] In his address to the convention, after his name was placed in nomination for president by Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey and he received a 15-minute standing ovation, Hart concluded, “Our party <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> will continue to hear from us.

2500|$|After all of Watchman Nee’s close {{co-workers}} {{were arrested}} on January 29, 1956, Tang and Ren were elected as elders, {{not by the}} congregation {{of the church in}} Shanghai, but by the [...] "Believers’ Political Re-education Committee," [...] which had been formed to oversee the political indoctrination of the church’s members. Tang and Ren cooperated in the PRC’s campaign to denounce Watchman Nee as a counterrevolutionary. Tang had earlier {{been a member of the}} Three-Self Standing Committee but withdrew from this position due to criticism by church members that he had betrayed the church in Shanghai. After his cooperation in denouncing Watchman Nee, Tang was reinstated and made a TSPM Vice Chairman. Under the leadership of Tang and Ren the Nanyang Road meeting hall built under Watchman Nee’s oversight for the church in Shanghai was given to the TSPM in 1958 and any semblance of the church in Shanghai’s meetings ceased. After undergoing re-education in a reform-through-labor (laogai) camp during the Cultural Revolution, Tang was reinstated as a Vice Chairman in the newly re-established TSPM and made a member of the standing committee of the China Christian Council, which was established by the TSPM in 1980. In July 1981 Tang issued a statement titled [...] "Pouring Out My Heart to the Party," [...] in which he said, [...] "I made a decision: anything that was expedient to the Party <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>country,</b> as long as I could do it, I would do it and would do it well." ...|$|E
