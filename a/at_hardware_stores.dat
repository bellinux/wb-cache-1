25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a sealed beam PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the lamp and the beam spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores.</b> PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E

50|$|At age twelve, Pérez {{worked for}} a company that {{manufactured}} barbed wire to buy an electric guitar (since his parents, according to Pérez, could not afford to pay for it). After a year of work he eventually was able to buy the guitar as his first musical instrument, although, according to Pérez, he could not play it for three months due to the hand injuries he received working at the factory. He then began private guitar lessons. Throughout his teenage years he worked <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores,</b> gas stations and as valet to buy his instruments and amplifiers.|$|E

The roofer heats the roll of roofing material with the torch until the asphalt melts, then presses the material onto the roof surface. Structure fires have been caused by improperly installing APP roofing. The torches are popular with handymen who use them to clear walkways, strip paint, burn weeds and perform other tasks.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in August 1970, Rheem began {{producing}} Heat {{pumps and}} HVAC units for residential applications, based in Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1983, Rheem introduced the Richmond Water Heaters brand to the market, aimed <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> and home-improvement centers. In 1984, Rheem {{was acquired by}} Pace Industries, Inc. The company discontinued containers in 1985, ending a 60-year run making steel drums and other containers. In the same year, the company acquired Raypak, Inc., which expanded the business into swimming pool heaters as well as commercial boilers. In 1988 Rheem was acquired by Paloma Industries, Ltd., a privately held Japanese company with headquarters in Nagoya, Japan, which wished to expand globally.|$|E
5000|$|Early Deep Water Culture (DWC) systems {{consisted}} of a five-gallon bucket, air stone, air pump and net pot with a medium. Five gallon buckets were the favorite of many early adopters of the system as they were readily available <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores.</b> Net pots come in three sizes: 6", 8" [...] and 10". Net pots are then filled with a hydroponic medium such as Hydroton and a Rockwool cube is added in the center that holds {{the base of the}} plant. For Oxygenation of the hydroponic solution, an airstone is added. This air stone is then connected to an airline that runs to an air pump.|$|E

50|$|Gorchynski {{denied that}} she had been {{affected}} by mass hysteria and pointed to her own medical history as evidence. After the exposure, she spent two weeks {{in the intensive care unit}} with breathing problems. She developed hepatitis and avascular necrosis in her knees. Riverside Coroner’s Office contacted Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to investigate the incident.Livermore Labs postulated that Ramirez had been using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent used as a powerful degreaser, as a home remedy for pain. Users of this substance report that it has a garlic-like taste. Sold in gel form <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores,</b> it could also explain the greasy appearance of Ramirez's body. The Livermore scientists theorized that the DMSO in Ramirez's system might have built up owing to urinary blockage caused by her kidney failure. Oxygen administered by the paramedics would have combined with the DMSO to form dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2). DMSO2 is known to crystallize at room temperature, and crystals were observed in some of Ramirez's drawn blood. Electric shocks administered during emergency defibrillation could have then converted the DMSO2 into dimethyl sulfate (DMSO4), a powerful poisonous gas, exposure to which could have caused the reported symptoms of the emergency room staff. The Livermore scientists postulated on The New Detectives that the change in temperature of the blood drawn, from the 98.6 F of Ramirez' body to the 64 degrees Fahrenheit of the emergency room, may have contributed to its conversion from DMSO2 into DMSO4.|$|E

30|$|Though the Herero {{may have}} {{retained}} {{some form of}} pastoral mobility, there are further social and economic {{changes that have occurred}} within Herero society since their (re)pastoralization and expansion in northwestern Botswana. Today, livestock production in the region is centred on a series of permanent hand-dug wells situated along interdune valleys. At almost every cattlepost, at least one owner possesses a 2000 -l plastic water tank, petrol or diesel generator and electric water pump. All of this equipment can be purchased <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> in the nearby town. For those who lack the resources to purchase this equipment, water can be accessed either for free at a government borehole near the village; through formal payment to a principal well owner; through informal herding arrangements where access forms part of payment in kind; and finally at private wells operated by hand, using buckets lowered and raised on a winch system (for those fortunate enough to be gain a permit from the land board and wealthy enough to afford the construction costs).|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{milestone}} deliverable from CSIRO for the EnergyFit Homes Initiative. The project partners to this Initiative are the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, CSR, AGL Energy, Australian Windows Association, Clean Energy Council, Energy Efficiency Council, Stockland, Fletcher Insulation, Knauf Insulation, the Centre for Liveability Real Estate, and the Energy Efficiency Certificate Creators Association. This report {{presents the results}} from a national telephone survey of consumers about understanding what information, from what sources at what time, and in what form is required to drive market uptake of low carbon homes. In total, {{a random sample of}} 866 Australians was interviewed for this survey. Respondents represented all Australian states and territories in proportions comparable to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data (2011). Results indicate respondents have a strong interest in energy efficient (EE) homes and their associated lower running costs, and that such homes are regarded as a priority, possible to achieve and not a hassle. Promoting key EE features, namely ceiling insulation, natural light, EE lighting, EE heating systems, and EE air conditioning, would likely be well-received by prospective buyers and tenants. EE homes were seen as providing comfort if they were cool in summer and warm in winter, had natural light, had good airflow/ventilation and were quiet. Therefore, promoting these features could increase the association of comfort with EE homes. The environmental benefits of EE homes were highlighted as motivating a decision and likely to elicit a response to buy or lease a home, especially if they were seen as popularly supported. Respondents were willing to pay for specific energy efficiency information about their prospective home, with about one third of respondents willing to pay $ 100 or more for information, although, respondents placed more emphasis on information on upfront costs than longer term running costs. Respondents indicated their preferred timing for feature-specific information when buying or renting was in the building inspection report, at ‘open for inspection’ events, and in home sales/rental advertising. Their preferred channels of information were via friends and family, product brochures, browsing <b>at</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>stores,</b> and use of energy ratings tools...|$|E
