2500|$|One may <b>associate</b> each divisor <b>with</b> <b>the</b> set {{of prime}} powers that divide it: thus, 12 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> set {2,3,4}, while 20 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> set {2,4,5}. Then 12∧20=4 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> set {2,3,4}∩{2,4,5}={2,4}, while 12∨20=60 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> set {2,3,4}∪{2,4,5}={2,3,4,5}, so the join and meet {{operations}} of the lattice correspond to union and intersection of sets.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

5|$|The other {{significant}} {{difference is that}} the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E
5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, {{in the form of}} high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
