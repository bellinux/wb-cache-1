5|$|Sinclair's {{licensing}} agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market. These were the Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair 1500 (both variants of the ZX81) and the Timex Sinclair 2068 (a {{variant of the}} ZX Spectrum). The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest; at one point, the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5,000 calls an hour, 50,000 a week, inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general. It was virtually identical to the ZX81 save for re-branding {{and the addition of}} an extra 1 KB of memory, making for <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>total</b> of 2 KB. In the five months following the TS1000's launch, the company sold 550,000 machines, earning Sinclair over $1.2 million in royalties.|$|E

5|$|The British {{official}} casualty {{return for}} the siege listed 156 killed, 326 wounded and 70 missing. Cornwallis surrendered 7,087 officers and enlisted men in Yorktown when he capitulated and a further 840 sailors from the British fleet in the York River. Another 84 prisoners had been taken during {{the assault on the}} redoubts on October 16. Since only 70 men were reported as missing, this would suggest that 14 of the men officially marked down as ‘killed’ had in fact been captured. This gives <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>total</b> of 142 killed, 326 wounded prisoners and 7,685 other prisoners. Jerome A.

Kashiwara Maru and Izumo Maru were temporarily referred to as No. 1001 Ship (Dai 1001 bankan) and No. 1002 Ship respectively to keep their conversions secret. Junyō was initially classified as an auxiliary aircraft carrier (Tokusetsu kokubokan), but following the loss of four Japanese fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, she was redesignated as a regular carrier (Kokubokan) in July; Hiyō, completed after the loss of the carriers, received that designation from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} steady attendance {{after opening}} in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By {{the end of}} that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of the eighteenth James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies. By New Year's Day, Titanic had made over $120million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. Its highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut. It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film. The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998 with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188.

5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>total</b> of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E

40|$|Plants {{should be}} built {{so that they}} are {{user-friendly}} and able to tolerate deviation from ideal performance as a result of operators and equipment failures without serious impacts on safety, productivity or efficiency. Before any effort for hazard reductions can be performed, it is important to first understand the hazards of a process which can be achieved through hazard assessments. Most of the current inherent safety assessment methods are index-based method which suffers from the shortcomings of subjective scaling. The aim of this research is to develop an inherent safety assessment method that eliminates the issue of subjective scaling in index scores assignment. The Numerical and Graphical Descriptive (GRAND) method is developed through the application of logistic functions. In this study, all petrochemical processes data obtained from literature was used in constructing numerical scores through the application of logistic functions. The numerical scores was then translated into graphical form. <b>GRAND</b> <b>Total</b> Score and <b>GRAND</b> Ranking Curve developed in this study can be used for the purpose of comparing alternative process synthesis routes to the desired product by their hazard level for inherent safety assessment during research and development (R&D) stage. Process route with <b>a</b> higher <b>GRAND</b> <b>Total</b> Score indicates greater hazards compared to the route with <b>a</b> lower <b>GRAND</b> <b>Total</b> Score. There are eight parameters involved which are divided into two groups. The first group is chemical safety parameters which consists of flammability, explosiveness, toxicity and reactivity parameters while the second group is process safety parameters which consists of temperature, pressure, heat of reaction and process inventory parameters. A gap elimination test was done on GRAND with the purpose of ensuring the elimination of subjective scaling. The gap elimination test result shows that GRAND has the ability to eliminate the problems of subjective scaling in scores assignment. The method developed was applied on two case studies which are methyl methacrylate manufacturing process and acetic acid manufacturing process. In the case study of methyl methacrylate manufacturing process, tertiary butyl alcohol based route was assessed as the safest route among the six routes evaluated while ethylene via propionaldehyde based route was assessed as the most hazardous one with the score of 311 and 509, respectively. There are ten process routes evaluated in the case study of acetic acid manufacturing process. GRAND assessment shows ethanol oxidation route as the safest route and ethane oxidation route as the most hazardous route with the score of 180 and 402 respectively. Results obtained from the gap elimination test as well as case studies performed proves that the method proposed in this research is successful in eliminating the common problem in index-based method which is subjective scaling for inherent safety assessment in petrochemical industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the variation in}} total effort expended by participants when prizes are awarded in <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> contest {{as opposed to a}} number of subcontests.

When no restrictions are placed on the contest technology, the results further demonstrate an "increasing-return-to-scale" property such that each individual responds to a proportional {{increase in the number of}} contestants and the number of each prize by increasing individual effort. Therefore, when a collection of identical subcontests forms <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> contest, the <b>total</b> effort always increases and the grand contest leads to a higher rent-dissipation rate.
