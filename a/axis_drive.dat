50|$|The Afrika Korps Assault Group {{began moving}} along the Hatab River valley towards Haidra and Tebessa {{in the early}} {{afternoon}} of February 21 and advanced until they met defenders consisting of the U.S. 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division and Combat Command B of the U.S. 1st Armored Division at Djebel el Hamra. The German-Italian force was halted and despite heavy pressure, including air attacks, failed to dislodge the American defenders. Having brought the <b>Axis</b> <b>drive</b> towards Tebessa to a halt, General Paul Robinett and General Terry Allen now turned their attention to planning a counterattack that was to take place the next day, February 22. Plans made by both sides were upset by the battle, and the Axis forces (5 Bersaglieri, a Semovente group from Centauro and 15 Panzer) launched another assault on the U.S. position {{on the morning of the}} 22 February. Although the American defenders were pressed hard, the line held and by mid-afternoon, the U.S. infantry and tanks launched a counterattack that broke the combined German and Italian force. More than 400 Axis prisoners were taken as the counterattack was pressed into the Afrika Korps position.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} October 1941, Major-General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov's Independent Coastal Army, {{numbering}} 32,000 men, {{had arrived}} at Sevastopol by sea from Odessa further west, it having been evacuated after heavy fighting. Petrov set about fortifying the inland approaches to Sevastopol. He aimed to halt the <b>Axis</b> <b>drive</b> on the port by creating three defence lines inland, the outermost arc being 16 km (10 mi) from the port itself. Soviet forces, including the Soviet 51st Army and elements of the Black Sea Fleet, were defeated in the Crimea in October and were evacuated in December, leaving Petrov's force as Sevastopol's main defence force. Having cleared {{the rest of the}} Crimea between 26 September - 16 November, the Romanian 3rd Army and German 11th Army prepared for an attack on the port. The German 11 Army was the weakest on the entire front, initially containing only seven infantry divisions. The Romanians contributed a large force, but were only lightly equipped and lacked self-propelled artillery. The weather turned against the Axis in mid-October and torrential downpours delayed the buildup. This gave Vice Admiral Filipp Oktyabrsky, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, time to bring in men and materiel from Novorossiysk. By 17 December, the weather had cleared sufficiently for the Axis to begin a major operation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} the mathematical modelling and simulation {{of the whole}} milling action in a milling machine. The mathematical model includes: (a) {{a model of the}} dynamics of the X <b>axis</b> <b>drive,</b> (b) a model of the dynamics of the spindle drive, (c) a model of the dynamics of the cutting process itself with cutting forces and torques and (d) the interconnection of (a), (b) and (c) to form the complete model of the milling action. The model uses both z and s plane transfer functions in order to model discrete and continuous parts of the system. The models of the X <b>axis</b> <b>drive</b> dynamics and spindle drive dynamics include models of the digital filter and analog converter in the velocity and position loop control. Friction is modelled in the machine table (part of the X <b>axis</b> <b>drive)</b> as a combination of stiction, coulomb and viscous friction. The model of the X <b>axis</b> <b>drive</b> dynamics is explained in detail whereas the model of the spindle drive dynamics is derived from the former. The model of the cutting process dynamics, which connects the other two models, is based upon a relatively simple analysis of the forces generated during face milling. The model is designed to be simulated by an existing computer simulation package and for this reason some dynamic equations are reoriented in order to avoid differentiation. This part of the paper concludes with an overall block diagram to represent the model of the whole milling action. The simulation of the mathematical model is then described, as are the tests carried out on the model and the actual machine in order to validate the model...|$|E

40|$|In {{multi-axis}} machining centers {{the individual}} operating loads of <b>axis</b> and spindle <b>drives</b> are often unknown. Especially in serial production, drive systems are oversized including electric motors, frequency inverters and shaft drives. But also in special plant engineering, where multiple drive systems {{are connected to}} one intermediate circuit, the individual operating loads cannot be assessed. Subsequently, performance, operating points and energy efficiency are suboptimal. Economic disadvantages, such as the necessity of higher investments and increased operational costs, are associated. Therefore an approach to active power measurement behind the frequency inverter to separate the power consumption profiles of spindle and <b>axis</b> <b>drives</b> is necessary. In this paper two systems for an active power measurement for variable frequency drives are discussed. One of them has been developed by the authors themselves with the advantage of lower cost compared to commercially available systems. The systems were analyzed for performance, accuracy, installation effort and costs. The investigated active power measurement systems provide basic data for an optimal dimensioning of drive systems for industrial equipment manufacturers...|$|R

A MATLAB/SIMULINK package was used to simulate this new model for a CNC machine tool feed drive.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{high-resolution}} 4 D imaging of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in zebrafish {{to investigate the}} earliest left-right asymmetric movements during cardiac morphogenesis. Differential migratory behavior within the heart field was observed, resulting in a rotation of the heart tube. The leftward displacement and rotation of the tube requires hyaluronan synthase 2 expression within the CPCs. Furthermore, by reducing or ectopically activating BMP signaling or by implantation of BMP beads we could demonstrate that BMP signaling, which is asymmetrically activated in the lateral plate mesoderm and regulated by early left-right signals, is required to direct CPC migration and cardiac rotation. Together, these results support a model in which CPCs migrate toward a BMP source during development of the linear heart tube, providing a mechanism by which the left-right <b>axis</b> <b>drives</b> asymmetric development of the vertebrate hear...|$|R
40|$|Autophagy is a conserved {{cellular}} degradative process {{important for}} cellular homoeostasis and survival. An early committal step during {{the initiation of}} autophagy requires {{the actions of a}} protein kinase called ATG 1 (autophagy gene 1). In mammalian cells, ATG 1 is represented by ULK 1 (uncoordinated- 51 -like kinase 1), which relies on its essential regulatory cofactors mATG 13, FIP 200 (focal adhesion kinase family-interacting protein 200 kDa) and ATG 101. Much evidence indicates that mTORC 1 [mechanistic (also known as mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1] signals downstream to the ULK 1 complex to negatively regulate autophagy. In this chapter, we discuss our understanding on how the mTORC 1 -ULK 1 signalling <b>axis</b> <b>drives</b> the initial steps of autophagy induction.

The setting of the drive clock can also be occasionally adjusted to compensate for changes in the Equation of Time. The target can be located on the same polar axis that is the mirror's primary rotation axis, or a second, stationary mirror can be used to reflect light from the polar axis toward the target, wherever that might be.
