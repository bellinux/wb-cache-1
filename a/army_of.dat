This crossing officially violated the Treaty of Campo Formio. On 2March, the Army was renamed <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Danube, upon {{orders of the}} French Directory.|$|E

5|$|Just {{over half}} of the French {{infantry}} were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were nearly all of the cavalry and, most importantly, the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core to steady the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez' <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the North and Kellermann's <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading towards them was Brunswick's coalition <b>army</b> <b>of</b> about 84,000, all veteran Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large complements of Hessians and the French royalist <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Condé.|$|E

5|$|On 24 March the French army retreated through Brussels. Dumouriez {{began calling}} in his {{detachments}} such as Harville's corps. At this point Dumouriez opened {{negotiations with the}} Austrians. He offered to evacuate Belgium if his armies were allowed an unmolested retreat. The terms were accepted and the French armies withdrew to camps behind the border. The <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Holland was allowed to march through enemy lines and took position near Lille. The <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Ardennes was posted at Maulde, the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the North at Bruille-Saint-Amand, and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Belgium at Condé-sur-l'Escaut and Valenciennes.

5|$|On March 1, 1799, the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Observation, in {{an order}} of battle of {{approximately}} 30,000men in four divisions, crossed the Rhine at Kehl and Basel as units crossed, they took the name <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Danube.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Danube was a field <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the French First Republic.

The army had three divisions plus an advance guard, a reserve, and an artillery park. The artillery park was {{under the command of}} Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière and consisted of 33 cannons and 19 howitzers operated by 1,329 non-commissioned officers and cannoneers as well as 60 officers. There were approximately 25,000 members of the Army, the role of which was to invade southwestern Germany, precipitating the War of the Second Coalition.|$|E

5|$|The French {{military}} strategy against Austria {{was for a}} three-pronged invasion to surround Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender and acceptance of French Revolutionary ideals. The French assembled the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Sambre and Meuse commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan against the Austrian <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Lower Rhine in the north; the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Rhine and Moselle, led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau, opposed the Austrian <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Upper Rhine {{in the south and}} the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Italy commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte approached Vienna through northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Roman <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) {{underwent}} a significant transformation {{as a result}} of the chaotic 3rd century. Unlike the <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the Principate, the <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were paid much less than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the 1st and 2nd centuries, but there is little evidence that this adversely affected the army's performance.|$|E

The first troops of the British Salonika Army, arrived in Salonika in October 1916, too late to prevent the Serbian Army from retreating into Albania and Greece. French, British and Russian troops arrived in Salonika between 1916 and 1917 and became known as the Allied <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Orient or Allied <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the East, under the overall command of French General Maurice Sarrail.|$|E

5|$|After his recovery, d'Hautpoul {{was given}} {{command of the}} heavy cavalry of the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Sambre-et-Meuse under General Paul Grenier.

When the French Directory abandoned the idea of an invasion of England, he was again deployed on the German front, this time as part of the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Danube. After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely charge at the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended on orders of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich.|$|E

5|$|After the defeats at {{the battles}} at Ostrach and Stockach, and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Danube's retreat into the Black Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command {{of both the}} <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Danube to André Masséna.

5|$|Although Artigas was {{defeated}} by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrredón called the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Andes and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the North (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Martín that if both armies did that, the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Martín also knew {{that most of the}} soldiers of the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Martín had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Martín finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with López; he thought that the conflict had ended.|$|E
5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

The left wing of the 80,000-man <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern. The <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E

Between 1918 and 1921, when the Bolsheviks assumed control of the Ukraine, over 50,000 Jews were killed, a further 100,000 were permanently maimed or died of wounds and 200,000 Jewish children became orphans.Israel Zangwill wrote:It is as Bolsheviks that the Jews of South Russia have been massacred by the <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Petlyura, though the <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Sokolow have massacred them as partisans <b>of</b> Petlyura, the <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Makhno as bourgeois capitalists, the <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Grigoriev as Communists, and the <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Denikin at once as Bolsheviks, capitalists and Ukrainian nationalists.|$|R
