5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony {{dating back to the}} early 1600s, in the years leading up to the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity. Horace Mann made the state's school system a national model. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American philosophy. Members of the transcendentalist movement emphasized the importance of the natural world <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> to humanity.|$|E
5|$|Original Stories is {{primarily}} about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind {{and becoming a}} rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being. The inset stories themselves emphasise the balance of reason <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> required for the girls to become mature, a theme that permeates Wollstonecraft's works, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.|$|E
5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character <b>and</b> <b>emotion.</b> Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between motives, <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> {{learning in the}} design of intelligent systems has received relatively little consideration to date. Clarification of the relationship involves tackling fundamental questions such as the survival value or adaptive function of motives <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> in intelligent systems, the nature of motivational and emotional processes which are features of 'innate' endowment, the learning of additional motives <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> as a result of environmental interaction, and the results of the influence of motives <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> on learning processes and, conversely, the effect of learning processes on the nature of motives <b>and</b> <b>emotions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Moods <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> are {{sometimes}} {{thought to be}} counterexamples to intentionalism, the view that a mental state’s phenomenal features are exhausted by its representational features. The problem is that moods <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> are accompanied by phenomenal experiences that {{do not seem to}} be adequately accounted for by any of their plausibly represented contents. This paper develops and defends an intentionalist view of the phenomenal character of moods <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> on which (1) directed moods <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> represent intentional objects as having sui generis affective properties, which happen to be uninstantiated, and (2) at least some moods represent affective properties not bound to any objects. ...|$|R

Recommender systems are de-signed to support humans making better decisions. It has been shown that personality <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> account for the variance in human de-cision making. We present various models and acquisition methods for <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> personality. Furthermore, we showcase examples of effec-tive exploitation of personality <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> in RS. We present in more details an example of the usage of emotions as implicit feedback for serendipitous recommendations...|$|R
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism <b>and</b> <b>emotion,</b> and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{was exposed}} to {{multiple}} influences through his life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, he learned about philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory <b>and</b> <b>emotion.</b> His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused his mind on issues {{of war and peace}} and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E

40|$|Discrepancies between people’s ought selves {{and their}} actual selves and their ideal selves and actual selves predict the emo-tions that {{individuals}} experience. The authors predicted that internal versus external causal attributions for self-discrepancies should moderate {{the relationship between}} self-discrepancies <b>and</b> <b>emotions,</b> resulting in more refined predictions for both agitation-and dejection-related <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> for two additional types of <b>emotion,</b> namely, anger-related <b>and</b> discontent-related emo-tions. Results of two studies generally supported the predictions that agitation-related <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> dejection-related <b>emotions</b> were positively associated with actual-ought discrepancies and actual-ideal discrepancies, respectively, only when causal attri-butions for the discrepancies were internally based. Anger-related <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> of discontent were positively asso-ciated with actual-ought and actual-ideal discrepancies, respec-tively, primarily when causal attributions were externally based. Study 2, which addressed group discrepancies <b>and</b> group-based <b>emotions,</b> generally replicated the findings when group identifi-cation was high, yielding a more complex model {{of the link between}} discrepancies <b>and</b> <b>emotions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E

40|$|In {{the near}} future, robots and CG (computer graphics) will be {{required}} to exhibit creative behaviors that reflect designers’ abstract images <b>and</b> <b>emotions.</b> However, there are no effective methods to develop abstract images <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> support designers in designing creative behaviors that reflect their images <b>and</b> <b>emotions.</b> Analogy <b>and</b> blending are two methods known to be very effective for designing creative behaviors. The aim {{of this study is to}} propose a method for developing designers’ abstract behavioral images <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> giving shape to them by constructing a computer system that supports a designer in the creation of the desired behavior. This method focuses on deriving inspiration from the behavioral aspects of natural phenomena rather than simply mimicking it. We have proposed two new methods for developing abstract behavioral images <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> by which a designer can use analogies from natural things such as animals and plants even when there is a difference in the number of joints between the natural object and the design target. The first method uses visual behavioral images, the second uses rhythmic behavioral images. We have demonstrated examples of designed behaviors to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between goal involvement <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> potential mediators and moderators of these relationships; a secondary aim was to examine the link between goal involvement and sport performance. The relationships between goal involvement <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> experienced before, during, and after competition were examined in Studies 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Cognitive appraisals (Study 1) and perceived performance (Studies 2 & 3) were examined as mediators of the links between task involvement <b>and</b> <b>emotions.</b> Also, perceived competence (Study 1), perceived performance (Studies 2 & 3), and outcome of the match (Study 3) were investigated as moderators of the relationships between ego involvement <b>and</b> <b>emotions.</b> Finally, the effects of achievement goals on <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> performance were experimentally tested in a speed-agility task (Study 4). Overall, task involvement was positively related to positive, and negatively associated with negative, emotions; challenge appraisal and perceived performance helped explain the majority of these links. Also, some relationships between ego involvement <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> were moderated by perceived performance and outcome. These findings suggest athletes should be task involved before or during competition and that ego involvement can be beneficial for emotions when perceived performance is high.
