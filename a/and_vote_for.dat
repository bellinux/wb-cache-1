5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

25|$|Those blacks enticed to join <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Democratic Party were {{attracted}} to the paternalistic, moderate appeal of Wade Hampton.

25|$|There {{were also}} {{allegations}} that no number had been shown {{for the public}} to call <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Armenia's entry during the telecast in Azerbaijan. Representatives denied these allegations by showing a video that showed an untampered signal during the Armenian performance. However, a subsequent EBU investigation found that the Azerbaijani broadcaster, Ictimai TV, had blurred out the number for Armenia's entry and distorted the TV signal when the Armenian contestants were performing on stage. The EBU fined Ictimai TV an undisclosed sum and is said to have threatened to exclude the broadcaster from the competition for up to three years if further infractions of the Eurovision Song Contest rules are made.|$|E

25|$|Following the war, the {{political}} energies {{of the newly}} independent states were focused on forming “a more perfect union,” first in the Articles of Confederation, later in the Constitution of the United States of America. The newly independent daughter churches of the Church of England also sought “a more perfect union,” and foremost in the leadership was the same Abraham Beach. In the winter of 1783/84 he corresponded with William White (later the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church) and other clergy in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York soliciting a gathering to “consider {{the state of the}} church.” He extended an invitation to meet at Christ Church May 11, 1784. The outgrowth of that meeting was a call for another meeting in October 1784 with representatives from all thirteen states to consider a general convention to manage the affairs of the newly independent church. The First General Convention met in September 1785, leading to the current shape of the church we now know: with equal voice <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> bishops, clergy and laity, the beginnings of an American Book of Common Prayer, and our own national Constitution and Canons.|$|E
500|$|As {{members of}} Rock the Vote <b>and</b> <b>Vote</b> <b>for</b> Change, the band has {{encouraged}} voter registration {{and participation in}} United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, [...] "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We {{have to get a}} new administration in." ...|$|E
500|$|Twenty {{years after}} first holding the {{governor}}ship, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race in 1955 using the slogan [...] "Be like your Pappy <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Happy". His {{opponents in the}} Democratic Party, led by senator and former governor Earle C. Clements and sitting governor Lawrence Wetherby, had difficulty finding a candidate to oppose him. The most likely choice, Lieutenant Governor Emerson [...] "Doc" [...] Beauchamp, was handicapped by his connections to political bosses in Logan County. Clements virtually hand-picked a relatively unknown candidate in Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge Bert T. Combs. Because Combs—whom Chandler nicknamed [...] "The Little Judge"—had no record for Chandler to campaign against, Chandler portrayed him as a pawn of Clements and Wetherby—who he derisively referred to as [...] "Clementine" [...] and [...] "Wetherbine".|$|E

500|$|Gold {{initially}} suggested two titles for the magazine, If and Galaxy. [...] Gold's art director, Washington Irving van der Poel, mocked up multiple layouts and Gold invited {{hundreds of}} writers, editors, artists, and fans to view them <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> their favorite; {{the vote was}} strongly for Galaxy as the title. [...] For the first issue, Gold obtained stories by several well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, and Theodore Sturgeon, as well as part one of Time Quarry by Clifford D. Simak (later published in book form as Time and Again). [...] Along with an essay by Gold, Galaxys premiere issue introduced a book review column by anthologist Groff Conklin, which ran until 1955, and a Willy Ley science column. Gold sought to implement high-quality printing techniques, although {{the quality of the}} available paper was insufficient for the full benefits to be seen.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, while Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Miliband {{attended}} the UK premiere {{of climate change}} film The Age of Stupid, where he was ambushed by actor Pete Postlethwaite, who threatened to return his OBE <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> any party other than Labour if the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station were {{to be given the}} go-ahead by the government. A month later, Miliband announced to the House of Commons a change to the government's policy on coal-fired power stations, saying that any potential new coal-fired power stations would be unable to receive government consent unless they could demonstrate that {{they would be able to}} effectively capture and bury 25% of the emissions they produce immediately, with a view to seeing that rise to 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a government source told the Guardian, effectively represented [...] "a complete rewrite of UK energy policy for the future".|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent and the Liberals {{suffered}} {{other problems}} during the campaign. According to Newman, St. Laurent sometimes seemed {{unaware of what}} was happening around him, and at one campaign stop, shook hands with the reporters who were following him, under the apparent impression they were local voters. On the evening of Diefenbaker's Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death, poking the voter in the stomach and saying [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government." [...] At another rally, Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal questioner, saying [...] "Look here, my good man, when the election comes, why don't you just go away <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the party you support? In fact, why don't you just go away?" ...|$|E
