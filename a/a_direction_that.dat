5|$|Stojadinović sought {{authority}} from Prince Paul {{to form a}} new cabinet, however Korošec as head of the Senate advised the prince {{to form a new}} government around Cvetković. Prince Paul dismissed Stojadinović and appointed Cvetković in his place, with <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> he reach an agreement with Maček. While these negotiations were ongoing, Italy invaded Albania. In August 1939, the Cvetković–Maček Agreement was concluded to create the Banovina of Croatia, which was to be a relatively autonomous political unit within Yugoslavia. Separatist Croats considered the Agreement did not go far enough, and many Serbs believed it went too far in giving power to Croats. The Cvetković-led cabinet formed {{in the wake of the}} Agreement was resolutely anti-Axis, and included five members of the HSS, with Maček as deputy Prime Minister. General Milan Nedić was Minister of the Army and Navy. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, German pressure on the government resulted in the resignation in mid-1940 of the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Stanoje Mihaldžić, who had been organising covert anti-Axis activities. In October 1940, Simović was again approached by plotters planning a coup but he was non-committal. From the outbreak of war British diplomacy focused on keeping Yugoslavia neutral, which the Ambassador Ronald Campbell apparently still believed possible.|$|E

25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> does not {{correspond}} to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; {{an example of this}} property is found in native copper.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) {{between the two}} surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not}} the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|An {{electromagnetic}} wave {{consists of two}} waves that are oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields. An {{electromagnetic wave}} travels in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> is {{at right angles to}} the oscillation direction of both fields. In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell showed that, in vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the wave equation both with speed equal to that of the speed of light. From this emerged the idea that light is an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies (and thus wavelengths), giving rise to various types of radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and Gamma rays.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{attempts}} to develop global social, political, and economic alternatives have led him in episodic engagements in national debates around the world. His approach in these engagements {{recognizes that the}} problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general structural arrangements can first be implemented, which will allow for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's guiding principle is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, {{and in this way}} a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over.|$|E

25|$|The {{solar wind}} and {{magnetosphere}} consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It {{is well known}} (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, {{the lines of the}} magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{if in the}} {{exercise}} of his discretion under s 6FA the Commissioner imposed a condition that had no reasonable connection with his function under the Act or the Letters Patent, that would not be a valid exercise of power. To take an extreme example, <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> leave to cross-examine would not be granted unless an applicant made a donation to a political party would be plainly invalid. But par 12 on its face seems rationally and reasonably related to the efficient performance of the obligations of the Commissioner. Paragraph 12 is a means of ascertaining whether or not an applicant has demonstrated a sufficient interest in challenging the evidence of a particular witness. Further, a statement under par 12 will alert the Commissioner and all others concerned as to the true extent of factual disputes and thus promote the efficient resolution of those disputes. In a large and complex administrative enquiry where there is no equivalent to the pleadings and particulars used in civil litigation, the par 12 procedure has an obvious utility.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1992, the UN {{responded to}} Serbian offensives {{in the former}} Yugoslav {{republic}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a full embargo on trade with Serbia by all member nations. The sanctions placed Greece, which had recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly after its declaration in 1992, in a difficult position. Serbia was an important trading partner with strong religious and historical ties to Greece, and Serbia had initially supported the Greek position on the Macedonia naming dispute. Beginning in 1992, the Konstantinos Mitsotakis and Andreas Papandreou governments, fearing that the Bosnian war would spread in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> would involve Turkey, Albania and Greece, undertook long series of peace-negotiations with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milošević, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, and the Bosnian government without results. Meanwhile, food, oil, and arms were reported moving from Greece into Serbia {{in violation of the}} UN embargo. Before, during, and after its 1994 presidency of the EU, Greece was the only EU nation to back the Serbian position that Serbian forces had entered Bosnian territory. In early 1994, Greece incurred the displeasure of its European allies by voting against NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Greece also refused the use of its NATO air bases at Preveza on the Ionian Sea for such attacks and refused to supply Greek troops to the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In NATO, Greece's position was diametrically opposed to that of Turkey, which supported the Bosnian government.|$|E

25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E

500|$|My Truth was {{released}} in Sweden on 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Around this time, RCA Records, Robyn's international label, were formulating the marketing plans for the album in the United States; the initial reports anticipated the release of an airplay single in September 1999, followed by the album in January 2000. Due to the inclusion of two songs that reflected on the abortion incident, RCA asked Robyn to re-record portions of the album for the American market and pop radio. On top of this, American music magazine Billboard published an article in June 1999 that falsely claimed she had a miscarriage rather than an abortion. Ultimately, Robyn refused to alter the record and a compromise was not reached. The negotiations {{came to an end}} after six months and the plans to release My Truth abroad were cancelled. Robyn's manager Alex Strehl said, [...] "I guess Robyn had moved in <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> [...] didn't expect." [...] According to Robyn, the label wanted an album like Robyn Is Here and thus were not interested in investing in My Truth.
