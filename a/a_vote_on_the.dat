The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed {{the presence of a}} glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{passed an}} {{unchanged}} bill on January 22, 2010, with a veto-proof two-thirds' majority, after {{an amendment to}} update the effective date was rejected. The measure moved for final approval to the House of Representatives, but on January 29, House Speaker Calvin Say moved to indefinitely postpone <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill, which was approved by voice vote. No votes were recorded and the move deferred action on the bill for 2010 unless two-thirds of Representatives vote to reconsider the bill, and it was considered dead.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he shared}} {{interests}} in both philanthropy and military affairs with his father, they eventually had a falling out while Johnston {{served as a}} State Assemblyman, and was bitterly opposed by his father in <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1889 World's Fair Bill. The feud became so heated that while Johnston was Mayor of Tivoli, his father, who owned the building where the town government met, barred his son from entering the building. The village government was forced {{to move to another}} building and remained there until 1894, when they finally returned to de Peyster's building. Another incident occurred and was reported in the press when Johnston's mother fell ill, and he visited her at the de Peyster family home and was violently assaulted by his father. The father {{went so far as to}} run against his son for Mayor of Tivoli in 1900, but was defeated in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|The Whitlam Government {{implemented}} {{a large number}} of new programs and policy changes, including the termination of military conscription, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programs. With the opposition-controlled Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a double dissolution election in 1974 in which he won a majority in the House of Representatives, albeit a slightly reduced one, and picked up three Senate seats.The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only 1974 joint sitting enabled under s. 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process. Despite the government's second election victory, the opposition, reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1973–75 recession, continued to obstruct the government's program in the Senate. In late 1975, the Opposition Senators refused to allow <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to back down, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended on 11 November, when Whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, at Government House in order to call a half-Senate election. Kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide.|$|E
