Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. It involved observing {{the height of a}} mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E

5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined together to make <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts).

It starred Helena Blackman as Nellie and Dave Willetts as Emile. Julian Woolford directed, with choreography by Chris Hocking. This production was most noted for its staging of the overture, which charted Nellie's journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to the South Pacific.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety.

In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E

One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas (Herkus Monte), a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising; today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Šnipiškės elderate ending at the boundary of Žirmūnai.|$|E

Musicians perform outdoors and at venues such as the Proletariat Gallery & Public House or Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe. While most ArtWalk events are concentrated downtown, {{there are a number}} or participants elsewhere on the island.|$|E
