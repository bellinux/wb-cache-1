The solutions of these problems illustrate the power of extended thermography and the notion of rich environments, the relevance and utility of a broad theory of games which may include kos and other loopy positions, and the robustness of this theory to a variety of interpretations of the rules. It also demonstrates the relevance of this branch of mathematics to the classical board games...|$|R
