5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics differs {{in several}} key areas from other {{titles in the}} Final Fantasy series. Instead of a generic battle screen, with the player's characters {{on one side and}} the enemies on the other, encounters take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields. Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles; movement and action ranges are determined by the character's statistics <b>and</b> <b>job</b> class. Battles are turn-based; a unit may act when its CT (Charge Time) reaches 100. Charge time is increased once every CT unit (a measure of time in battles) by an amount equal to the unit's speed statistic. When CT reaches 100 or greater, the unit may act. During battle, whenever a unit performs an action successfully, it gains Experience Points (EXP) <b>and</b> <b>Job</b> Points (JP).|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports <b>and</b> <b>job</b> providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination <b>and</b> <b>job</b> losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E

By late 1945, returning soldiers encountered a chronic housing <b>and</b> <b>job</b> shortage in the city. The GI Bill allowed many St. Louis veterans to purchase homes and pursue higher education, which encouraged sub-urbanization that after the war reduced the city's population.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
