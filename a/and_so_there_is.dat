5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E

25|$|Queens of P. snelleni produce males before females, {{which is}} called protandrous production. This is driven by sexual {{selection}} for the optimum sex ratio, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a higher fitness for all. Because of protandrous production, orphaned workers are selected to produce female offspring, since they are reproducing so late in the season. They mate {{in order to make}} diploid female offspring.|$|E
25|$|For example, when Σ is a 2-sphere, this Hilbert {{space is}} {{one-dimensional}} <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one state. When Σ is a 2-torus the states {{correspond to the}} integrable representations of the affine Lie algebra corresponding to g at level k. Characterizations of the conformal blocks at higher genera are not necessary for Witten's solution of Chern–Simons theory.|$|E
25|$|What {{is clear}} from this is that these two teams are in effect one and the same. All that has {{happened}} is that the nomenclature has changed, as it so often did in Georgian times. Furthermore, all the players named above, with the single exception of Bridger who had a short career, are recognised players <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no doubt that the team in question was of top-class standard. The problem as so often is what to call it.|$|E

25|$|When {{this second}} {{convention}} is followed, the term normal model {{is used to}} refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals a and b satisfy a = b. In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem so that only normal models are considered.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluidized}} bed filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. The principle is to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below {{so that the}} sand becomes fluidized – behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in liquefaction, quick sand, and industrial processes including municipal sewage treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a large surface for aerobic denitrification bacteria. Therefore, {{the size of the}} filter can be modest.|$|E
25|$|An {{association}} {{energy of}} 22-25kJ/mol {{is typical of}} charge-induced dipole interactions, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> interest {{in the use of}} charged linkers and metals. The metal–hydrogen bond strength is diminished in MOFs, probably due to charge diffusion, so 2+ and 3+ metal ions are being studied to strengthen this interaction even further. A problem with this approach is that MOFs with exposed metal surfaces have lower concentrations of linkers; this makes them difficult to synthesize, as they are prone to framework collapse. This may diminish their useful lifetimes as well. Most common strategies to increase this binding energy for MOFs and molecular hydrogen have been reviewed.|$|E

25|$|In Charismatic and Pentecostal communities, anointing of {{the sick}} is a {{frequent}} practice and {{has been an important}} ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.|$|E
25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no antigenic shift. The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses {{would not be able to}} survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{hoped to}} fool viewers into {{thinking}} {{that they were doing}} a straightforward séance episode, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little humour prior to the episode's first twist. For Steadman, the writing meant that both the audience and the character of Tina are fooled together. Nonetheless, humour remained elsewhere in the script; Lloyd looked forward to performing a particular joke involving blue paint. Terry refers to his colleagues variously as [...] "Pepe and His Friends", a reference to a variety act with a similar name, and a [...] "warm prop", a disparaging name which, according to the writers, has been used in the film industry to refer to extras.|$|E

500|$|Viruses are an {{established}} cause {{of cancer in}} humans and other species. Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals). Cancer viruses come {{from a range of}} virus families, including both RNA and DNA viruses, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no single type of [...] "oncovirus" [...] (an obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming retroviruses). The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity and mutations in the host. Viruses accepted to cause human cancers include some genotypes of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein–Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human T-lymphotropic virus. The most recently discovered human cancer virus is a polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus) that causes most cases of a rare form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.|$|E
500|$|In 2007 they {{obtained}} {{funding for}} the link between Boston and Spalding. [...] Work on a new lock beside the Black Sluice pumping station at Boston - to connect The Haven and the South Forty-Foot Drain - was formally started on 8 February 2008, and was completed in December 2008, with the official opening ceremony being held on 20 March 2009. The lock project formed phase 1 of the scheme, {{and the cost of}} £8.5 million was jointly funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the East Midlands Development Agency, and Lincolnshire County Council. The lock is designed to be used for a period either side of high tide, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a rise from the Drain to the Haven. It has conventional mitre gates at one end, but uses rotating sector gates at the tidal end, each one weighing 12.1 tonnes.|$|E
500|$|Several {{obstacles}} remain {{before the}} canal restoration can be completed. To join the two navigable sections a new bridge {{would be needed}} where the canal is culverted under Commercial Road, and the infilled section to Abergarwed {{would need to be}} excavated. The original bridge at Commercial Road is buried beneath the new embankment, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> sufficient headroom available through the embankment without major alterations to the road level. Rebuilding of the two Abergarwed locks and Resolven lock would then create a single stretch of canal some [...] long. Extension to the south is blocked by a bridge at water level in Neath, but in 2009 Neath Port Talbot Council commissioned the Prince's Foundation and British Petroleum to investigate options for the regeneration of the Canal Green area, between the river and the railway line, and the proposals suggested that it should be replaced by a lifting or bascule bridge.|$|E

2500|$|For {{quantum electrodynamics}} the ghost field decouples because the gauge group is abelian.

2500|$|The two stream {{instability}} can {{be thought}} of as the inverse of Landau damping, where the existence of a greater number of particles that move slower than the wave phase velocity [...] as compared with those that move faster, leads to an energy transfer from the wave to the particles. In the case of the {{two stream instability}}, when an electron stream is injected to the plasma, the particles' velocity distribution function has a [...] "bump" [...] on its [...] "tail". If a wave has phase velocity in the region where the slope is positive, there is a greater number of faster particles (...) than slower particles, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a greater amount of energy being transferred from the fast particles to the wave, giving rise to exponential wave growth.|$|E
