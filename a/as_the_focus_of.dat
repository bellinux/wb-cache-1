5|$|As the League developed, {{its role}} expanded, {{and by the}} middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of {{international}} activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.|$|E

5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{major change}} in {{international}} trade was {{the rapid expansion of}} the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather goods. Initially relying on hired ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.|$|E
5|$|Yuki started Fairy Cube {{with the}} goal of writing a short series. Because of the story's nature as a serial, she faced page limitations. When {{deciding}} on the ending, she considered having Ian and Rin as the sacrifice to close the demon door, but rejected it, feeling that it would be too unpleasant for the readers, although she expressed her fondness for sad endings. She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage's newfound friendship, because Rin and Ian's romantic relationship served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the story.|$|E
30|$|There is {{evidence}} that, with the previously-mentioned Ames’ distorted room illusion, the illusion persists when people view {{the room with}} two eyes (Glennerster et al. 2003), although, in that case, the effect may be reduced (Gehringer and Engel 1986). This suggests that any information about distance that may be gained via triangulation, or any other clue such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focussing</b> <b>of</b> our eyes, is not sufficiently clear or precise to overcome viewers’ preconceptions that the room has the conventional rectangular form.|$|R
40|$|The early medieval {{period from}} 5 th to 12 th centuries AD {{witnessed}} several {{changes in the}} religious landscape of early medieval Orissa. The brahmanical religions began to construct huge temples in various eco-niches. Temples began to perform several roles in the cultural eco-niches of micro and meso regions. First, temple formed nuclei of appropriation and integration of autochthonous cults. Eschemann’s analysis of the Hinduisation of autochthonous cults in Orissa is one primary example {{of the role of}} temple (Eschmann 1978 : 84). Further, temple acted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> popularisation of various brahmanical cults. In Orissa, we see the evidence of several cults – Shakti, Saiva, Vaisnava in this period. While temple building in the Indian context can be predated to 2 nd century BC, it was only after 5 th century AD that temple building became an important component of brahmanical religions. Third, temple also acted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> agricultural expansion. There are not many evidence of land grants to temples in Orissa but epigraphic reference points out to the land grants to brahmanas who were given land grants to perform certain functions in the temple.

5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector {{in an effort to}} draw German attention away from the French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was withdrawn}} back to Australia in early 1944 for rest and reorganisation. During this period it was stationed at Tenterfield, where the soldiers experienced a bitterly cold winter, {{before moving to}} Petrie and then Kiari on the Atherton Tablelands. The battalion was reorganised to conform {{with the requirements of}} the jungle divisional establishment, and as a result its vehicles were changed to include jeeps and trailers, instead of trucks, which were considered impractical in the jungle. A change of commanding officer also took place in this time, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haupt– who had previously served as battalion second-in-command before leaving to take over command of the 62nd Battalion in January 1943– returning to take over from Fidock. A long period of training, which included courses in amphibious warfare and various jungle exercises followed, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the fighting in the Pacific shifted away from Australian forces towards the US military. Consequently, it was not until close {{to the end of the}} war that the battalion went into action again. Before this, the battalion contributed to an Australian contingent that was sent to India to lecture British Army officers on the lessons of jungle warfare.|$|E

Primarily centred on the city centre, there are a large number of chain stores, as well as the Thistles shopping centre.

25|$|The {{research}} on maternal sensitivity follows earlier work in psychoanalytics and is especially rooted in attachment theory. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> psychoanalytics shifted from individuals (particularly adults) to children, research studies on mother–infant dyads, {{on the effects}} of early childhood on development, and on pregnancy became wider. A psychologist named John Bowlby eventually developed the attachment theory in 1969. Mary Ainsworth, who worked with Bowlby, along with her colleagues created the concept of maternal sensitivity in 1978 in order to describe early mother–infant interaction observed in her empirical studies.|$|E

The most devastating action was the bombing raids of 6th and 7 March 1944 by the Soviet Air Force, which destroyed the baroque old town.|$|E
25|$|The {{battalion}} subsequently concentrated {{along with}} the rest of the division in Palestine, around Gaza.
