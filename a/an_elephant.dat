5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed {{part of its}} training, but Martial {{attributed}} it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power. He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by <b>an</b> <b>elephant,</b> {{but there is nothing}} to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E

5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> and a tree.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E

50|$|Most {{contemporary}} ethologists {{view the}} elephant {{as one of}} the world's most intelligent animals. With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), <b>an</b> <b>elephant's</b> brain has more mass than that of any other land animal, and although the largest whales have body masses twenty times those of <b>a</b> typical <b>elephant,</b> <b>a</b> whale's brain is barely twice the mass of <b>an</b> <b>elephant's</b> brain. In addition, <b>elephants</b> have <b>a</b> total of 300 billion neurons. Elephant brains are similar to humans' in terms of general connectivity and areas. The elephant cortex has as many neurons as a human brain, suggesting convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|Elephants are herbivores, {{consuming}} ripe bananas, leaves, bamboo, tree bark, {{and other}} fruits. Eating occupies 18 hours of <b>an</b> <b>elephant's</b> day. They eat 100-200 kilograms of food per day. A cow (female) will eat 5.6 {{percent of her}} body weight per day. A bull (male) will eat 4.8 percent. Thus a 3,000 kilogram cow will consume 168 kg per day, a 4,000 kg bull 192 kg per day. <b>As</b> <b>elephants</b> can digest only 40 percent of their daily intake, the result is dung amounting to 50-60 kg daily. <b>As</b> <b>elephants</b> will not eat in unclean surroundings fouled by dung, their instinct is to roam to a new area.|$|R

This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose <b>an</b> <b>elephant,</b> and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart <b>an</b> <b>elephant,</b> prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs.

5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on <b>an</b> <b>elephant.</b> Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E

5|$|In Jainism, Kubera is the {{attendant}} Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath.

The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Svetambaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or <b>an</b> <b>elephant.</b> He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how <b>an</b> <b>elephant</b> is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
