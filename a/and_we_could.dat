25|$|Geoff Pullar and David Sheppard made a solid start and, at lunch, {{they were}} both still there with 86 on the board. We had a {{discussion}} and thought we still stood an outside chance of a surprise win. By tea, we had changed our minds because the score had only crept to only 185 <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hardly expect to make 196 in two hours, even with Ted Dexter still in and looking for runs. At the close Barry Knight and I were still there with 100 needed. Benaud had made it practically impossible for us to win, or for them.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} part, {{consider}} a shortest path P (there {{may be more}} than one) from source to u with at most i edges. Let v be the last vertex before u on this path. Then, the part of the path from source to v is a shortest path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, since if it were not, then there must be some strictly shorter path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> then append the edge uv to this path to obtain a path with at most i edges that is strictly shorter than P -- a contradiction. By inductive assumption, v.distance after i−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from source to v. Therefore, uv.weight + v.distance is at most the length of P. In the ith iteration, u.distance gets compared with uv.weight + v.distance, and is set equal to it if uv.weight + v.distance was smaller. Therefore, after i iterations, u.distance is at most the length of P, i.e., the length of the shortest path from source to u that uses at most i edges.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|Beach Thomas's war work led {{to state}} recognition, {{as it did}} for many of the correspondents and {{newspaper}} owners; France appointed him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not reject the title with any decency."

500|$|Leopold's physician-in-ordinary, Christian Stockmar (later, as Baron Stockmar, {{advisor to}} both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert), wrote {{that in the}} first six months of the marriage, he had never seen Charlotte wear {{anything}} that was not simple and in good taste. [...] He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold's influence. [...] Leopold wrote later, [...] "Except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be together, we did not tire."

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script.

I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We had a wonderful time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|E

500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt him as a person. His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. So after a presidential election, he was a changed man, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not have the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new outlook is the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six years that I have known him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E
500|$|On Friday, 29 April, {{during the}} first {{qualifying}} session to determine the starting order for the race, Rubens Barrichello, a driver for Jordan, hit a kerb at the Variante Bassa corner at 140mph (225km/h), launching him into the air. He hit {{the top of the}} tyre barrier, and was knocked unconscious. His car rolled several times after landing before coming to rest upside down. Medical teams treated him at the crash site, and he was taken to the circuit's medical centre before being transferred to Maggiore Hospital in Bologna by helicopter for routine tests and observation to be carried out. He returned to the race meeting the next day, although his broken nose and a plaster cast on his arm forced him to sit {{out the rest of the}} race weekend. Ten years after the incident, Damon Hill, who drove for the Williams-Renault team at the time, described the feeling after the crash: [...] "We all brushed ourselves off and carried on qualifying, reassured that our cars were tough as tanks <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be shaken but not hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|The allies {{decided to}} divide their forces into two armies: a {{multinational}} force {{that included the}} 1st Division and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. The 1st Division led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. He found the long march to Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, highly uncomfortable. He had spent his life {{up to that point}} fighting Hispanic-Americans, and he was now marching as their ally, surrounded by them. He did not trust them, and they trusted neither him nor his men. The only person among the allies with whom he shared his thoughts, and guardedly at that, was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (later president of Argentina): [...] "We [...] form in here a separate group; we do not talk to anyone; no one approaches us <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> say that we walk among enemies." [...] On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, they faced Rosas and his army. The allies were victorious, Rosas fled to the United Kingdom, and Marques de Sousa acquired his carriage as a war trophy.|$|E

500|$|The Crusaders' {{winning run}} {{finally came to}} an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, [...] "...in some ways it was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could stop talking about it <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get on with playing it week by week." [...] The Crusaders {{recovered}} to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{generally}} remains true {{to the original}} novels, several scenes and characters were removed or merged with others to bring the script to a reasonable length. [...] Noting that [...] "there wasn't time for everything", the producers cut completely {{the scene in the}} Temple of Bel-Shamharoth and the associated plotline about the significance of the number eight; Director Vadim Jean defended the decision, saying [...] "we could have gone there, but we went to the Wyrmberg instead. There [...] time constraints <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have gone one way or the other, so we went the whole hog on just one." [...] The scenes in the Wyrmberg were themselves shortened and simplified, reducing the character of Li!ort to a cameo and losing the characters of K!sdra, Greicha and Hrun completely. [...] The inter-wizard rivalry at Unseen University, by contrast, was expanded and spread out throughout the film, while in the novels the sequences are short and mainly found in The Light Fantastic. [...] This established Trymon as a more easily recognisable antagonist. To avoid the necessity of explaining the deus ex machina in detail, the Octavo in the film simply causes A'Tuin to roll to recapture Rincewind, whereas in the novel, a complicated 'change spell' returns him to the disc. [...] The creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions which invade reality at the end of The Light Fantastic, and Rincewind's fight in the Dungeon Dimensions themselves, are completely omitted, and Trymon is simply driven mad by reading the Octavo spells {{at the end of the}} film version. Galder Weatherwax is also killed by Trymon in the film version, whereas, in the books, he is killed by accidentally summoning the Luggage instead of Rincewind.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have done it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E
