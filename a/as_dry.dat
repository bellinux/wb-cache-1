5|$|Friedman {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on July 31, 1912. His parents, Sára Ethel (née Landau) and Jenő Saul Friedman, were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Beregszász in Carpathian Ruthenia, Kingdom of Hungary (now Berehove in Ukraine). They both worked <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> goods merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to Rahway, New Jersey. In his early teens, Friedman was injured in a car accident, which scarred his upper lip. A talented student, Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928, just before his 16th birthday.|$|E

5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E

5|$|On August10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} a westward moving tropical wave emerging off {{the west}} coast of Africa, centered along 16°W. Accompanied by disorganized convective activity, development, if any, was expected to be slow. A broad area of low pressure subsequently formed within the wave about halfway between Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. Embedded within an elongated trough, the weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished. Interaction with a monsoon trough reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on August11 across a large area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, but the surface low had dissipated by this time. Development was no longer expected over the following days <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air created a hostile area for storm organization. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic and entered the Caribbean Sea on August16. Subsequent interactions with South America and an upper-level trough inhibited improvement of the system.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{wind shear}} increased, {{caused by the}} outflow of {{powerful}} Hurricane John to its east. Additionally, the hurricane moved into an area of cooler water temperatures, {{and as a result}} its appearance became ragged and amorphous. At the same time, steering currents weakened, and the future of Kristy was uncertain; the NHC forecast the hurricane to continue slowly westward, dissipating within four days. However, other hurricane models suggested a motion to the southwest, and two models predicted a Fujiwhara effect, or an orbiting of two tropical cyclones, which would eventually result in Kristy being absorbed by Hurricane John. On September1, Kristy weakened to tropical storm status, and it weakened faster <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air encroached the storm. It turned southeastward as the ridge to its north strengthened. On September2, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and it was forecast to degenerate into a remnant low within 24hours. Later that day, Kristy weakened to tropical depression status.|$|E
5|$|The series {{consists}} of four role-playing games and one social card game. Each game typically features a third-person camera. The player controls the player character in a combination of combat and puzzle game elements to achieve goals and complete the story. Hotroit Stories is the only installment to feature an overhead perspective, while Daibouken Monsters is played as a card game, with no character movement. All games in the series feature a battle mode. During battles, player command a single human ally. To fight enemies in the main game, players use magical abilities or familiars; in Hotroit Stories, players attack using items such <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> ice for similar effects, while Daibouken Monsters limits players to using familiars only. The battle mode in Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom is on an open battlefield, allowing players to freely roam around the area, while Dominion of the Dark Djinn employs a grid layout, whereby players can create formations to avoid attacks.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of June21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15mi (20km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. Centered just {{off the coast of}} Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. Hours later, {{convection}} rapidly diminished <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175mi (280km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.|$|E

5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion {{of the body of}} water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula. However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air from the Arabian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{sequence}} of Cabo Verde hurricanes, Lisa began as a tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September20, about 460mi (740km) southwest of Cabo Verde. An unusually weak subtropical ridge steered the system north, east, and north again over subsequent days. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lisa six hours after formation, but fell back to tropical depression intensity by 18:00UTC on September22 <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air entered the circulation. A more favorable environment allowed Lisa to re-attain tropical storm status by 12:00UTC the following day and subsequently begin a period of rapid intensification; it reached hurricane intensity by 21:00UTC on September24 and reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) six hours later. Progressively cooler waters and stronger shear caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical storm early on September25, weaken to a tropical depression early on September26, and degenerate into a remnant low at 18:00UTC that day. The remnant low moved northwest and north, dissipating by 06:00UTC on September29 about 595mi (960km) south-southwest of the Azores.|$|E

5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to turn toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They {{are one of the most}} popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form.|$|E
5|$|Remaining a {{tropical}} depression for about 18hours, Kyle re-intensified to tropical storm status on October 1, after redeveloping some thunderstorms {{southeast of the}} center. Despite unfavorable wind shear, the convection became better organized, developing into rain bands and wrapping into the mid-level circulation of the storm. Late on October 2, Kyle developed an eye feature {{in the center of}} the storm, and the winds increased to about 65mph (105km/h); operationally it was forecast to regain hurricane status. However, the storm encountered further wind shear, which left the center exposed from the convection by early on October 4. Convection became intermittent and separated from the circulation, and Kyle again weakened to tropical depression status on October 5. By then, the storm had begun a steady west-northwest motion, which was followed by a slow turn to the north-northeast. On October 6, a decrease in wind shear allowed the cyclone to again reach tropical storm status, about 295miles (475km) west-northwest of Bermuda. Around the same time, the system was located in an area of weak steering currents; a ridge was to its northeast and southwest, an upper-level low was to its east-southeast, and a broad trough was to its northwest. By October 7, it began a slow southwestward motion around a ridge to its west. The circulation became elongated <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> air limited convection, and after shear increased on October 8, Kyle weakened to tropical depression status.|$|E

5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger {{than anything else in}} their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted <b>as</b> <b>dry</b> or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E
