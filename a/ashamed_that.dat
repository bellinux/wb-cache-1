When setting {{certain parts}} of the letters about which one should be {{particularly}} <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> they had to be written, the musician assumes the attitude only of the composer who had previously selected the letters: he does not interpret, he does not comment. He rather reduces speech to its sounds and makes music with them. Permutations of vowel-sounds, a, ä, e, i, o, u; serial structure.|$|E
25|$|One view of {{difference}} between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself {{but in order to}} be embarrassed one's actions must be revealed to others. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate {{as to whether or not}} shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> they have been judged negatively by others.|$|E
25|$|The {{journalist}} who {{reported on the}} event believed that most people who turned up for the meeting were not actually interested in votes for women at all, but had instead come to witness any trouble if there was any. The only violence {{on the day of}} the Dartford meeting, however, was a stone which was thrown at the wagon from a neighbouring backyard, but no damage was caused. At the end of the speech, Florence Conybeare invited Councillor W.H.D. King to give the vote of thanks. He said that he felt <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> he had the vote while they did not, but thanked the party for recognising Dartford as a place of importance worth visiting.|$|E

25|$|By {{the opening}} of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, it is {{revealed}} that Lupin and Tonks have married. Later in the book, Lupin informs Harry, Ron and Hermione that Tonks is pregnant. However, feeling <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> he has turned Tonks into an outcast and guilty that his unborn child has a high chance of inheriting lycanthropy, Lupin plans to leave Tonks and their baby. This results in an intense argument between him and Harry, who insists that Lupin's actions are cowardly. Eventually, Lupin recognises the truth in Harry's words and returns to his wife {{in time for the}} birth of their son, Teddy Lupin, and subsequently asks Harry to be the boy's godfather, which duty and honour he accepts.|$|E
25|$|Fifth Day of the Fifth Moon; this one-day holiday {{dubbed the}} Dragon Boat Festival {{was held in}} honor of an ancient Chinese statesman Qu Yuan (c. 340-278 BC) from the State of Chu. <b>Ashamed</b> <b>that</b> he could not save the dire affairs of his state or his king by {{offering}} good council, Qu Yuan leaped into a river and committed suicide; {{it was said that}} soon after many went out on the river in boats {{in a desperate attempt to}} rescue him if still alive. This act turned into a festive tradition of boarding a dragon boat to race against other oarsmen, and also to call out Qu's name, still in search of him. The type of food commonly eaten during the Tang period for this festival was either glutinous millet or rice wrapped in leaves and boiled.|$|E
25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E

500|$|In {{late spring}} 1942, Andrić {{sent a message}} of sympathy to Draža Mihailović, {{the leader of the}} royalist Chetniks, one of two {{resistance}} movements vying for power in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, the other being Josip Broz Tito's communist Partisans. In 1944, Andrić was forced to leave his friend's apartment during the Allied bombing of Belgrade and evacuate the city. As he joined a column of refugees, he became <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> he was fleeing by himself, in contrast to the masses of people accompanied by their children, spouses and infirm parents. [...] "I looked myself up and down," [...] he wrote, [...] "and saw I was saving only myself and my overcoat." [...] In the ensuing months, Andrić refused to leave the apartment, even during the heaviest bombing. That October, the Red Army and the Partisans drove the Germans out of Belgrade, and Tito proclaimed himself Yugoslavia's ruler.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} San Francisco on March 13, 1923, and lasted until late June. Despite the initial {{contract}} between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed {{to double the}} film's budget to $347,000 three days after shooting began. Von Stroheim had already worked twenty-hour days for over two months of pre-production and collapsed on set {{after a few days}} of filming. He remained in good health {{for the remainder of the}} shoot. This was not the only mishap on set; during scenes shot at San Francisco Bay, Cesare Gravina got double pneumonia, making von Stroheim bitterly <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> Gravina's entire performance was later cut from the film, despite the actor's dedication to the role. Hersholt was knocked out by Gowland during the picnic scene in which McTeague and Schouler fight, and Pitts was almost run over by a trolley. In late May, Lehr visited von Stroheim on the set and praised the footage that he had seen, saying that [...] "it has atmosphere, color and realism that could not possibly have been reproduced in the studio." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1941, Nasser {{was posted}} to Khartoum, Sudan, which {{was part of}} Egypt at the time. Nasser {{returned}} to Sudan in September 1942 after a brief stay in Egypt, then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943. In 1942, the British Ambassador Miles Lampson marched into King Farouk's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies. Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, [...] "I am <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> our army has not reacted against this attack", and wished for [...] "calamity" [...] to overtake the British. Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year. He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution. Nasser stayed in touch with the group's members primarily through Amer, who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force's various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them.|$|E
500|$|No further {{mention of}} William is made until the Siege of Antioch in 1098. The crusaders had {{successfully}} taken the city, but were then besieged themselves {{by a large}} Muslim army led by Kerbogha of Mosul. The crusaders suffered from lack of supplies, {{and there were many}} desertions; William fled Antioch in January 1098, along with the French monk Peter the Hermit, who had led his own army to Constantinople before the main crusaders arrived there. William was probably a member of Bohemond of Taranto's army at this point, because Bohemond sent his nephew Tancred to find them, and they were brought back to Bohemond's camp. Robert the Monk assumes that William fled because [...] "he had never before experienced such suffering from hunger." [...] William [...] "spent the whole of the night...in Bohemond's tent, lying on the ground like a piece of rubbish." [...] Bohemond rebuked him as a [...] "wretched disgrace to the whole Frankish army", and mentioned his desertion of the French army in Spain in 1087. The other leaders asked Bohemond to spare him and William suffered no further punishment. However, William was so <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> he deserted the army again.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{whispered in}} society that Rasputin had seduced {{not only the}} Tsarina but also the four Grand Duchesses. Rasputin had {{released}} ardent, though by all accounts completely innocent in nature, letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him. They circulated throughout society, fueling rumors. Pornographic cartoons circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went {{on a pilgrimage to}} Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on December 17, 1916. [...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916, a few weeks before Rasputin was killed. However, as she grew older, Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country. Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry, was the murderer of [...] "Father Grigory." [...] Dmitri and Felix Yussupov, the husband of her first cousin Princess Irina of Russia, were among the murderers. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared [...] "cold and visibly terribly upset" [...] by Rasputin's death and sat [...] "huddled up closely together" [...] on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the reverse side by Olga, her sisters and mother. However, Olga was {{the only member of the}} family who did not attend Rasputin's funeral, according to the diary of her first cousin once removed Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia. According to the memoirs of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I, Olga said in February 1917, about a month after the murder, that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed, it should never have been done [...] "so terribly." [...] She was <b>ashamed</b> <b>that</b> the murderers were her relatives. After Olga and her sisters had been killed, the Bolsheviks found that each was wearing an amulet bearing Rasputin's image and a prayer around their necks.|$|E
