50|$|Modern antique (<b>an</b> {{apparent}} <b>oxymoron)</b> {{can have}} various meanings. Since customs laws and dealers often stipulate {{an age of}} at least a hundred years for any item to be legitimately called an antique, the term is sometimes used to describe a collector's item that is technologically obsolete; for example, an older computer or retro toy.|$|R
500|$|The cover art {{and title}} of the album was first affirmed via the RCA Records website. Regarding the {{title of the}} album, Yankovic {{mentioned}} that, [...] "That was just <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron</b> that I've always been amused by. It's used a lot in corporate retreats and, I'm told, in the military." [...] Yankovic also acknowledged that the name is speculated to be a reference to the album marking the end of his 32-year-long label contract.|$|E

[...] Apart from the risks {{associated}} with nuclear power, [...] "multibillion-dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost-effective when compared with other energy sources." [...] The authors also believe that clean coal is <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron</b> for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine-related deaths and the fact that coal-fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning.|$|E

Rheannon also states that there is little coverage of social issues. For example, nowhere is there mention of how water supply privatization and delivery by multinational corporations could affect the poor people of the world.|$|E
50|$|Humanitarian bombing is {{a phrase}} {{referring}} to the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (24 March - 10 June 1999) during the Kosovo War used by its opponents as <b>an</b> ironic <b>oxymoron</b> {{in response to the}} stated goal of NATO to protect Kosovo Albanians, and later about other military interventions stressing human rights reasons.

[...] As Rubén Gallo has explained, the Mexican concept of institutionalizing the Revolution simply refers to the corporatist nature of the PRI—that is, the PRI subsumed the [...] "disruptive energy" [...] of the Revolution (and thereby ensured its own longevity) by co-opting and incorporating its enemies into its bureaucratic government as new institutional sectors.|$|R
500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron,</b> is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron.</b> Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while {{she may be a}} good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E
500|$|I. Q. Hunter {{identifies}} a prefabricated cult film style {{which includes}} [...] "deliberately, insulting bad films", [...] "slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation", and mainstream films [...] "that sell themselves as worth obsessing over". [...] Writing for NPR, Scott Tobias states that Don Coscarelli, whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm. [...] Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as {{trying too hard}} to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness. [...] Influenced by the successful online hype of The Blair Witch Project (1999), other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom {{with the use of}} prefabricated cult appeal. [...] Snakes on a Plane (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans. [...] Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be. [...] This reached the point of convergence culture when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production. [...] Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released, it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following. [...] In retrospect, critic Spencer Kornhaber would call it a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a [...] "more naive era of the Internet". [...] However, it became influential in both marketing and titling. [...] This trend of [...] "instant cult classics" [...] which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer, who states that the phrase is <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron.</b>|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{demonstrate}} the existence of demophobic principles {{in the theory of}} modern democracy. Liberal theoretical propositions decreed the subsumption of the demos in the government of all, reduction of the presence of the masses in politics, the exteriority of their modes of organization, and rationalization of administration of "the many". The study focuses on liberal thinkers from the late 18 th to the early 20 th centuries, but is not limited to them. The result is the enunciation of <b>a</b> political <b>oxymoron</b> (demophobic democracy), which also appears as an epistemological obstacle to democratic experimentation...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known print citation of chickenhawk in {{this sense}} was in the June 16, 1986 issue of The New Republic. An association between the word chickenhawk and war was popularized several years earlier in the 1983 bestselling book Chickenhawk, a memoir by Robert Mason about his service in the Vietnam War, {{in which he was}} a helicopter pilot. Mason used the word as <b>a</b> compound <b>oxymoron</b> to describe both his fear of combat ("chicken") and his attraction to it ("hawk"), a slightly different use of the term which nonetheless might have inspired the current usage.|$|R
500|$|In 1998 Hügel-Marshall {{published}} her autobiography, Daheim unterwegs: Ein deutsches Leben, chronicling {{her experiences}} surviving {{as a black}} woman in Germany. Daheim means [...] "at home" [...] while unterwegs means [...] "on the way" [...] or [...] "in transit"; the combination is <b>a</b> deliberate <b>oxymoron</b> suggesting someone seeking a home in her own country. The English translation of the book, published in 2001 by Continuum International Publishers, is titled Invisible Woman: Growing Up Black in Germany; an annotated English version was published by Peter Lang Publishing in 2008. The book explores the relationship with her father and with Germany, and describes a search for her identity.|$|R

5000|$|Unity in {{diversity}} (Latin: unitas in varetite) {{is a political}} motto advocating federalism or multiculturalism.

The phrase {{can be traced to}} Leibniz, who uses it as a definition of [...] "harmony" [...] (Harmonia est unitas in varietate) in his Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei super omnia (1677/8). In modern politics it was first used, as In varietate unitas, by Ernesto Teodoro Moneta in the context of Italian Unification.In 1943 it invoked by Adélard Godbout, Premier of Quebec, {{in the context of the}} situation of French Canadians within Canada.The variant In varietate concordia was adopted as the motto of the European Union in 2000.|$|R
2500|$|Detractors, however, view punk as anti-religious. Adherence to the {{practice}} of Christianity (or any religion, established or not) is, by definition, conformity to rules set forth by someone other than the individual for him or herself. Because punk is ideologically nihilistic, many view [...] "Christian Punk" [...] as <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron</b> and view it simply as a subgenre of Christian rock and completely separate from punk rock; although Christian punk appropriated punk sound and fashion, no other similarities exist and the two genres have completely isolated origins. Followers of Christian Punk tend to cite punk's individualistic values and argue that punk ideology does not preclude critical and non-dogmatic religious belief.|$|E

40|$|Experience with {{re-engineering}} {{suggests that}} if a better model can be developed consumers will embrace it willingly and job quality can be improved. Many examples of re-engineered systems exist; a familiar one that has created <b>a</b> new <b>oxymoron</b> is “adult paperboys”. Until recently, adolescents delivered newspapers after school. Competition from other media forced the newspapers to shift to morning editions. Paperboys became difficult to find for early morning delivery hours and with few productivity gains, {{the costs of the}} distribution system were increasing. Finally the newspaper publishers examined their logistics systems and realized that they could re-engineer the distribution system by hiring adults to make early morning deliveries in cars. Re-engineering newspaper deliveries reduced cost and improved service. Increased wages for the adult paperboys were traded off against savings in the costs of paper dropoff depots...|$|R
2500|$|Tutu has {{described}} himself as a socialist, in 1986 relating that [...] "All my experiences with capitalism, I'm afraid, have indicated that it encourages some of the worst features in people. Eat or be eaten. It is underlined by the survival of the fittest. I can't buy that. I mean, maybe it's the awful face of capitalism, but I haven't seen the other face." [...] Tutu has often used the aphorism that [...] "African communism" [...] is <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron</b> because—in his view—Africans are intrinsically spiritual and this conflicts with the atheistic nature of Marxism.

2500|$|Modern Orthodoxy is, {{almost by}} definition, {{inhibited}} {{from becoming a}} strong movement, because this would entail organization and authority to a degree [...] "which goes against the very grain of modernity". A related difficulty is that Modern Orthodox rabbis who do adopt stringencies may, in the process, lose the support of precisely the [...] "Modern" [...] group they sought to lead. The logic: since one {{of the characteristics of}} religious orthodoxy is the submission to the authority of its tradition, the individual is expected to conform to all of its dictates, whereas modernity, by contrast, emphasizes a measure of personal autonomy as well as rationalist truth. The very term [...] "Modern Orthodoxy" [...] is thus, in some sense, <b>an</b> <b>oxymoron.</b>|$|E

In offenses of absolute liability, other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an intentional act, and [...] "intent" [...] is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred.
