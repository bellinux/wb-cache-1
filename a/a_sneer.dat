25|$|Foreman was {{sometimes}} {{characterized by the}} media as an aloof and antisocial champion. According to them, he always seemed to wear <b>a</b> <b>sneer</b> and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of Sonny Liston, for whom {{he had been an}} occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion José Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, and it took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.|$|E
500|$|The aircraft's {{offensive}} capabilities were sarcastically {{referred to}} as a [...] "Triple Threat" [...] — it could bomb you, strafe you, or fall on you. Positive aspects, such as the F-105's responsive controls, strong performance at high speed and low altitude, and its outfit of electronics won over some pilots. For some, [...] "Thud" [...] was a term of endearment; retroactively the RF-84F Thunderflash became known as [...] "Thud's Mother". F-105 pilot Colonel Jack Broughton said of the nickname: [...] "The Thud has justified herself, and the name that was originally spoken with <b>a</b> <b>sneer</b> has become one of utmost respect through the air fraternity".|$|E
500|$|For Marlborough, though, {{time had}} run out. His {{strategic}} gains in 1711 made it virtually {{certain that the}} Allies would march on Paris the following year, but Harley {{had no intention of}} letting the war progress that far and risk jeopardising the favourable terms secured from the secret Anglo-French talks (based on the idea that PhilipV would remain on the Spanish throne) that had proceeded throughout the year. Marlborough had long had doubts about the Whig policy of [...] "No Peace without Spain", but he was reluctant to abandon his allies (including the Elector of Hanover, Anne's heir presumptive), and sided with the Whigs in opposing the peace preliminaries. Personal entreaties from the Queen (who had long tired of the war), failed to persuade the Duke. The Elector {{made it clear that he}} too was against the proposals, and publicly sided with the Whigs. Nevertheless, Anne remained resolute, and on 7 December 1711 (O.S.) she was able to announce that – [...] "notwithstanding those who delight in the arts of war" [...] – <b>a</b> <b>sneer</b> towards Marlborough – [...] "both time and place are appointed for opening the treaty of a general peace".|$|E

2500|$|Writing in 1944, {{the liberal}} {{economist}} Friedrich Hayek {{said of the}} change in political attitudes that had occurred since the Great War: [...] "Perhaps nothing shows this change more clearly than that, while there is no lack of sympathetic treatment of Bismarck in contemporary English literature, the name of Gladstone is rarely mentioned by the younger generation without <b>a</b> <b>sneer</b> over his Victorian morality and naive utopianism".|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "celebrated" [...] {{story was}} told in elite circles about Helms' appointment. The Soviet {{ambassador}} had said with <b>a</b> <b>sneer,</b> to Amir Abbas Hoveyda the Shah's prime minister, [...] "We hear the Americans are sending their Number One spy to Iran." [...] Hoveyda replied, [...] "The Americans are our friends. At least they don't send us their Number Ten spy." [...] Helms, for his part, referred to Hoveyda as [...] "Iran's most consummate politician." ...|$|E

"We have solemnly warned you, {{and that}} in the most {{determined}} manner, that if you do not cease that course of wanton abuse of the citizens of this county, that vengeance would overtake you sooner or later, and that when it did come it would be as furious as the mountain torrent, and as terrible as the beating tempest; but you have affected to despise our warnings, and pass them off with <b>a</b> <b>sneer,</b> or a grin, or a threat, and pursued your former course; and vengeance sleepeth not, neither does it slumber; and unless you heed us this time, and attend to our request, it will overtake you at an hour when you do not expect, and at a day when you do not look for it; and for you there shall be no escape; for there is but one decree for you, which is depart, depart, or a more fatal calamity shall befall you." ...|$|E

60|$|Fletcher {{looked up}} sharply, his clear {{intelligent}} eyes full upon Wilding's calm face, his countenance expressing {{as little as}} did Wilding's. Ferguson seemed slightly taken aback. Grey's thick lips were twisted in <b>a</b> <b>sneering</b> smile.|$|R
