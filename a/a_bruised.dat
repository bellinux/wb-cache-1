5|$|Croyle {{entered the}} 2008 {{season as the}} Chiefs' {{starting}} quarterback. During the season opener against the New England Patriots on September 7, Croyle left {{the game in the}} third quarter with <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> shoulder after being sacked by linebacker Adalius Thomas. Prior to the injury, Croyle completed 11 out of 19 with no touchdowns or interceptions. Two days after the game, the Chiefs signed quarterback Ingle Martin off the Tennessee Titans' practice squad to back up Damon Huard and Tyler Thigpen in Croyle's absence. In Croyle's absence, Damon Huard started the Chiefs' game against the Oakland Raiders the following week. Huard suffered a neck injury, so Tyler Thigpen became the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February, Totti was sidelined {{for about}} a month after {{sustaining}} <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> right buttock.

5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in {{with the}} score at 6/553, and held up his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes.

5|$|At the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders traded Brewer, Josh Green {{and their}} second round {{selection}} (Brad Winchester) {{in the same}} draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík. Although surprised to be traded, Brewer was excited {{at the prospect of}} playing for the Oilers, who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team. Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best plus/minus rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15. Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars. Brewer had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.|$|E
5|$|He {{kept his}} place, but in November, an injury {{sustained}} against Mallorca {{was diagnosed as}} <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> kidney and fractured vertebrae, which kept him out for some weeks, during which time Zé Castro forced his way into consideration as a starter. In January 2007, Pablo marked his 100th game for the club with a rare goal to earn a draw with Racing Santander, and completed the season with 24 league games. He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar {{had a great}} showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 {{a minivan}} {{collided}} with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 {{it was reported that}} he was nearly recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Lin did {{not play}} in the 2013 All-Star Game, held in Houston, after {{finishing}} third in the voting behind Bryant and Chris Paul for the two starting guards of the Western Conference. He was selected instead {{to compete in the}} Skills Challenge during All-Star Weekend. His scoring, shooting percentage, and 3-point percentage improved after the All-Star break, and he finished with season averages of 13.4 points and 6.1 assists. Lin and center Ömer Aşık were the only Rockets to play in all 82 games. Houston qualified for the playoffs, but lost in the first round in six games to the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder. Lin suffered <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> chest in Game 2, which limited him in Game 3 and sidelined him for the two games after. He returned for the final game, coming off the bench for three points in 13 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{was then}} rested and Saggers {{took his place}} for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested {{for the next two}} matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted {{steadily}} with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.|$|E

5|$|The drivers {{took the}} track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in wet weather, with lap times {{slower than the}} {{previous}} days' practice and qualifying sessions. Häkkinen maintained his good performance, setting a time of 2:03.392. Michael Schumacher was the second-fastest driver; Button was third, two-thousands of a second behind Schumacher. Barrichello completed the top four, three-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen. Giancarlo Fisichella struck the barriers heavily at turn 14 after spinning sideways and was launched into the air, landing upside-down; the session was suspended while marshals cleared the track of debris. Fisichella sustained <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> left knee, {{and was forced to}} start the race with his team's spare car. Jacques Villeneuve damaged his car's rear end in a crash later in the session, but was able to continue.|$|E
5|$|With {{running back}} James Wilder nursing <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> sternum, Nathan Wonsley rushed for 138 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. Wonsley became the first Buccaneer running back, other than Wilder, to rush for 100 yards since Nov. 29, 1981. He was the first Tampa Bay rookie to rush for 100 yards since Jerry Eckwood in 1979. Wonsley {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his two older brothers, George and Otis, both backup NFL running backs who came off the bench to have breakout games while leading their respective teams to victory against the Lions. Constant Buccaneer blitzes resulted in four sacks, two interceptions, and six forced fumbles. Although Lions quarterback Eric Hipple had a good statistical day, completing 31 passes for 318 yards, the Tampa Bay defense's pressure prevented him from converting his opportunities into points. The win broke Tampa Bay's 19-game road losing streak.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with <b>a</b> <b>bruised,</b> brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E

5|$|He {{signed for}} York {{permanently}} on 26 January {{for an undisclosed}} fee on a contract {{until the end of}} 2009–10 season. His first appearance after returning came as a 74th-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw against Altrincham on 27 January. <b>A</b> <b>bruised</b> foot picked up in a reserve-team match meant he was unable to play for York against Grays Athletic in April. He was forced into missing some matches towards the end of 2008–09 due to concerns over his baby daughter, which he finished with 17 appearances and two goals for York. Smith made his first appearance of 2009–10 after being introduced as an 86th-minute substitute against Rushden & Diamonds on 11 August, the second match of the season, which finished as a 0–0 draw. In the following match, he came on in the 87th minute and played as a striker, scoring York's second goal in a 2–0 victory over Forest Green Rovers. Soon after this match, he suffered from sciatica during a training session. He featured as a substitute in York's play-off semi-final first leg victory over Luton Town, which finished 1–0, with the tie ending 2–0 on aggregate. After finishing the season with 34 appearances and two goals for York he entered negotiations with the club over a new contract.|$|E
5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
5|$|Ziggler became {{involved}} in an on-screen love affair with Lana, the former manager of Rusev, when she kissed him at Raw on May 25, with Lana serving as Ziggler's valet during his matches. During this time, Ziggler started incorporating elements of 80's glam rock fashion into his entrance and ring attire; typical of 80's bands like Mötley Crüe and Poison. In June, after Ziggler and Lana confirmed their storyline relationship, Summer Rae allied with Rusev to even the odds. After an attack by Rusev, Ziggler suffered <b>a</b> <b>bruised</b> trachea in storyline, which was {{to give him some}} time off to film a new WWE Studios movie, titled 6:42. Ziggler returned on the August 17 episode of Raw, aiding Lana during a confrontation against Rusev and Summer Rae. This altercation prompted a match between Ziggler and Rusev at SummerSlam, which ended in a double countout due to interference from Lana and Rae. In a rematch on September 20 at Night of Champions, Ziggler emerged victorious. On October 11, when TMZ reported the real–life engagement of Rusev and Lana, this officially ended their feud. The following night on Raw, Ziggler unsuccessfully challenged John Cena for the United States Championship.|$|E
