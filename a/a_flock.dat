5|$|A breed society, the Jacob Sheep Society, {{was formed}} in July 1969. Mary Cavendish, dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who had <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of Jacob sheep at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, was the first {{president}} of the society. From 1972 onwards, the society published <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> book.|$|E

Because they’re {{travelling}} in the same direction. At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to teach a migration route to <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of birds, for example in re-introduction schemes.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> in West Yorkshire, England allegedly found a way to get over cattle grids by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.|$|E
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{systems are}} {{collections}} of independent agents interacting {{with each other}} and with their environment to produce emergent behaviour. Agent-based computer simulation is one of the main ways of studying complex systems. A naive approach to such simulation can fare poorly, due to large communication overhead, and due to the scope for deadlock between the interacting agents sharing a computational platform. Agent interaction can instead be considered entirely from the point of view of the environment(s) within which the agents interact. Structuring a simulation using such Environment Orientation leads to a simulation that reduces communication overhead, that is effectively deadlock-free, and yet still behaves in the manner required. Additionally the Environment Orientation architecture eases the development of more sophisticated large-scale simulations, with multiple kinds of complex agents, situated in and interacting with multiple kinds of environments. We describe the Environment Orientation simulation architecture. We report on a number of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Environment Orientation approach: <b>a</b> simple <b>flocking</b> system, <b>a</b> <b>flocking</b> system with multiple sensory environments, and <b>a</b> <b>flocking</b> system in <b>an</b> external environment...|$|R
5|$|The {{large size}} of flocks {{can also cause}} problems. Common {{starlings}} may be sucked into aircraft jet engines, {{one of the worst}} instances of this being an incident in Boston in 1960, when sixty-two people died after a turboprop airliner flew into <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> and plummeted into the sea at Winthrop Harbor.|$|E
5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail feathers being black. It was not an albino as its skin seemed to have had the normal, dark color and it was part of <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. <b>A</b> <b>flock</b> of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E

40|$|In <b>a</b> <b>flocking</b> {{scenario}} of multi-agent systems, the connectivity {{of the group}} of agents is caused either by individual's local cohesion interaction mechanism or by external boundary constraints. The latter case is particularly interesting when an individual's cohesion ability is not reliable due to the limitation of communication range. The effect of external boundary constraints on the connectivity property of multi-agents has been intensively investigated in natural observation and engineering simulation. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper which reveals that a group of agents in a bounded plane can be almost always jointly connected and hence form <b>a</b> complete <b>flock...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the later}} and better-known version of Compert Con Culainn, Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the {{previous}} version, the Ulstermen go hunting <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.|$|E
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, {{small groups of}} goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but {{did not do so}} where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap.|$|E
5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} {{is found in}} North Africa and the Middle East. In Africa its range extends through Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger. In the Middle East it is native to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and its range extends as far as Pakistan and north west India. In 2016, <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of around a hundred birds arrived at Kutch after a gap of 19 years.|$|E
5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of <b>a</b> <b>flock.</b> Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. <b>A</b> <b>flock</b> of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
