5|$|Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS Anson was {{revealed}} {{only a short}} distance off, limping southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham {{was not prepared to}} lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on Loire, which was unable to escape. Accompanying Anson was Kangaroo, recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, Anson and Loire began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. Kangaroo closed on the unprotected stern of Loire, firing <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 Loire had lost her mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.|$|E

25|$|On 14 May 1805, {{seventeen}} {{months after}} the British occupied the island, a large French fleet arrived in Fort-de-France Bay, having briefly exchanged fire with the British on Diamond Rock as they did so. The fleet, under Pierre de Villeneuve, was joined {{over the next few}} days by Spanish ships under Federico Gravina. As the Spanish ship San Rafael approached on 16 May, the British hoisted the French flag, luring the Spanish ship to pass close by. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> the British forces replaced the French colours with the British, and opened fire, taking the Spanish by surprise (such a false flag was considered a perfectly legitimate, indeed traditional, ruse de guerre during that era). Shortly after this it was discovered that the main cistern, holding a month's supply of water, had cracked in some earth tremors, and the leak had been made worse by the vibration from the guns. There was barely two weeks left, but fresh supplies were now unobtainable as a blockade of the rock began by a number of schooners, brigs and frigates.|$|E

500|$|To {{the right}} of Queen Charlotte, HMS Brunswick had {{initially}} struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain John Harvey received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped Queen Charlotte, blocking her view of {{the eastern half of}} the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> Harvey hoped to run aboard Jacobin and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between Achille and Vengeur du Peuple. This manoeuvre failed when Brunswick's anchors became entangled in Vengeur's rigging. Harvey's master asked if Vengeur should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied [...] "No; we have got her and we will keep her". The two ships swung so close to each other that Brunswick's crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet.|$|E
500|$|Davies had a {{reasonably}} quiet 2006 domestic season with both bat and ball. In four 50-over matches for Somerset she scored 34 runs {{at an average}} of 8.50, and took four wickets {{at an average of}} 33.75, taking a wicket in each match. Davies was again selected for the Super Fours, this time playing for the Emeralds. She made 74 runs at 14.80 in five matches with a highest score of 29, but was ineffective with the ball, taking 2 wickets at 74.00. Davies performed well for England A during a match against the touring Indian side, restricting the visitors to just fifteen runs off her ten overs, taking two wickets <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> [...] Opening both the batting and bowling for England in this match, she then added an unbeaten 27, albeit off 77 balls, to help England A secure victory via the Duckworth–Lewis method.

[...] She finished the tournament near the top of both the batting and bowling averages charts, boosted by her performance against Ireland, in which she took three wickets for just six runs conceded in her bowling duties, and followed it up with a score of 31 as her side chased a low Irish total of 69 to win.|$|E
500|$|Closely {{following}} Victory as {{she passed}} through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship Bucentaure, Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing Victorys stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun Neptune and the 74-gun Redoutable, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> Redoutables broadside carried away Temeraires mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from Neptune, Temeraire narrowly avoided a collision with Redoutable. Another broadside from Neptune brought down Temeraires fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that the Redoutable had come up alongside the Victory and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board the Victory. Temeraire was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across Redoutables stern, Temeraire discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, captain of the Redoutable, recorded that [...] "...the three-decker – who had doubtless perceived that the Victory had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the Redoutable to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It {{would be impossible to}} describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it." ...|$|E

500|$|Temeraire then rammed {{into the}} Redoutable, {{dismounting}} {{many of the}} French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. Temeraire now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> from the 112-gun Spanish ship Santa Ana lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship Fougueux, which came up on Temeraires un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until Fougueux came within point blank range. Temeraires first broadside against Fougueux at a range of 100yards caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into Temeraire, whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. Temeraire was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled {{in a letter to}} his wife [...] "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her." [...] Redoutable, sandwiched between Victory and Temeraire, suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of Redoutable killed and wounded a number of Temeraires crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. Temeraire narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from Redoutable exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only Temeraire, but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.|$|E

2500|$|Garner's first leading film role, in {{the romantic}} comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a {{teenager}} who finds herself {{trapped in the}} body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her [...] "startling": [...] "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an [...] "utterly beguiling" [...] performance: [...] "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: [...] "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for." [...] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success. Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure. Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner [...] "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> winningly in 13 Going on 30. Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability [...] "to blend charm and gravity" [...] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her [...] "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [...] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giving {{it three}} out of five stars, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized Damita Jo saying it {{featured}} [...] "a slew of the gooey, structureless sex ballads that have become Janet's staple." [...] Cinquemani also called the songs [...] "Like You Don't Love Me" [...] and [...] "Moist" [...] "two of the album's best." [...] Entertainment Weekly rated it a 'C+' saying [...] "The tracks, many produced by her longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, have the sumptuous, homogenized creaminess we've come to expect from her." [...] Angus Batey of Yahoo! Music UK gave it four out of ten stars, saying [...] "Numerous explanatory spoken word asides seek to reassure us that Janet, as she approaches 40, is seeking love rather than reveling in lust." [...] However, she called [...] "R Junkie" [...] "a delicious throwback, like a glorious 'Rhythm Nation'", [...] "I Want You" [...] "a peculiar post-modern waltz with a '40s supper club vibe, being the ear-catcher", and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] "another precision-tooled winner, with Jackson using an almost ethereal higher-pitched vocal delivery." [...] Neil Strauss of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, saying Damita Jo [...] "smacks of trying too hard. [...] {{the truth is that}} Jackson is just trying to humanize herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> well on her breakthrough 1986 album, Control [...] Jackson has had eighteen years of monster hits, so it's hard to fault her instincts. [...] but there's too much of Jackson's moistness to wade through to get to Damita Jo's solid ground." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music -- as with anything, it all depends on the artist. [...] Damita Jo proves that she was merely flirting with modesty, since it's as explicit as pop music gets." [...] Ian Wade of BBC Music had mixed feelings, saying that [...] "While there's nothing outwardly bad about Damita Jo, at 22 tracks over 65 minutes, your attention does start to wander and you almost forget it's playing. But after a third or fourth listen, the slick grooves of [...] "Spending Time With You" [...] and [...] "Island Life" [...] gain more identity. [...] Damita Jo heralds no real major leap forward, but it's no pig's ear either. A bit of editing and a couple of killer dance tracks would've made it even better." ...|$|E
