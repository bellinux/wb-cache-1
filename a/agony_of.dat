5|$|To {{compound}} the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> his defeat, Adams' son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died in late November. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, {{who had already}} left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend Jefferson's inauguration. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successor's inauguration.|$|E
5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E

5|$|Haislett was {{the first}} American woman to defeat a swimmer from East Germany in the 100-meter {{freestyle}} since the 1972 Summer Olympics; she did so at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle, Washington. At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Western Australia, Haislett won the 100-meter freestyle, and swam the anchor legs for the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays, ending the East German women's eighteen years of overwhelming dominance in the 100-meter freestyle at the world championships. Haislett also endured the emotional <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water.|$|E
5|$|The first church {{built on}} the cathedral site also had a tabernacle, but its exact {{location}} is unknown. During {{the construction of the}} cathedral, the tabernacle was housed in what are now the Chapels of San Isidro and Our Lady of <b>Agony</b> <b>of</b> Granada. However, in the 18thcentury, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral. It is constructed of tezontle (a reddish porous volcanic rock) and white stone {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.|$|E
5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E

5|$|United {{suffered}} the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> reaching {{three out of}} four Scottish Cup finals in the mid-1980s, only to lose them all by a single goal. First came a 2–1 defeat to Celtic in 1984–85, compounded by a 1–0 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season; then a 1–0 defeat in extra time to St Mirren in 1986–87; and finally, a last-minute 2–1 loss against Celtic the following year, despite being a goal ahead. A three-year gap ensued before the 1990–91 Scottish Cup final, which pitted Jim McLean against his brother Tommy, at Motherwell. The final was won 4–3 by 'Well, with United again losing in extra time. The sixth Cup Final loss was also the club's fifth final appearance in eleven years.|$|E

Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards. It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard Titanic.|$|E

25|$|After a few {{generations of}} {{existing}} within the Roman systems, the Jewish desire for independence did finally come to a head and resulted in the Bar Kobha revolt in 132-135 CE. In Jewish tradition, the temple was seen as indestructible and a physical manifestation {{of the power of}} God and God’s connection to the Jewish people. With its destruction, Jews resorted to the traditional explanation that they had transgressed and were being punished for their sins. The religious reaction to the destruction was evident through changes in halakhah (Jewish Law), midrashim, and 2 Baruch, all of which mention the <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the temple’s destruction.|$|E
