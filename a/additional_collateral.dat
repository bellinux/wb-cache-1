5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: {{unconventional}} warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force. Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform <b>additional,</b> or <b>collateral,</b> activities outside their primary missions.

5000|$|AIG {{had sold}} credit {{protection}} through its London {{unit in the}} form of credit default swaps (CDSs) on collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) but they had declined in value. [...] The AIG Financial Products division, headed by Joseph Cassano, in London, had entered into credit default swaps to insure $441 billion worth of securities originally rated AAA. Of those securities, $57.8 billion were structured debt securities backed by subprime loans. As a result, AIG’s credit rating was downgraded and it was required to post <b>additional</b> <b>collateral</b> with its trading counter-parties, leading to a liquidity crisis that began on September 16, 2008, and essentially bankrupted all of AIG. The United States Federal Reserve Bank stepped in, announcing the creation of a secured credit facility of up to US$85 billion to prevent the company's collapse, enabling AIG to deliver <b>additional</b> <b>collateral</b> to its credit default swap trading partners.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the interaction between three phenomena: corporate restructuring, choice of law, and transaction avoidance. In this context, scholars have criticised Art. 13 of the European Insolvency Regulation for providing a possibility for forum shopping. This article enables firms to declare {{the law of the}} eu Member State where the provisions on transaction avoidance allow for the most freedom to take restructuring measures applicable to contracts. Literature on company restructuring shows that a combination of restructuring measures – usually additional credit for <b>additional</b> conditions and/or <b>collateral</b> - helps companies overcome financial distress. We argue that rules on transaction avoidance should take this balance into account when voidance is demanded. Using the example of Dutch and German rules on transaction avoidance, we argue that the German rules are more accommodative than the Dutch rules. Therefore, firms may benefit using the German rules on transaction avoidance rather than the Dutch rules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Various {{explanations}} {{have been}} offered {{in the literature on}} the underlying cause of joint attention deficits in autism. One possible explanation is that children with autism are capable of producing joint attention but lack the social motivation to share their interests with others. The current study used a single-subject reversal design with alternating treatments to examine whether joint attention initiations for social sharing would occur as a collateral effect of utilizing the motivational techniques of Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) in conjunction with perseverative interest stimuli for three young nonverbal children with autism. Results indicated an immediate increase in joint attention initiations when perseverative, or highly pre-ferred, interests were incorporated within the motivational techniques of PRT. <b>Additional</b> find-ings included <b>collateral</b> increases in joint attention initiations toward less preferred interests, as well as improvements in the quality of interaction between the children and caregivers.

40|$|The {{global market}} for {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs) has exhibited strong growth in recent years, reaching US$ 2. 3 trillion {{by the end}} of 2013. ETFs have clear advantages for investors, such as low-cost portfolio diversification and the liquidity of an exchange-traded product. However, recent disruptions in certain ETF pro-ducts have highlighted the need to better understand the vulnerabilities and risks associated with this market. ETFs are generally perceived by investors as having equity-like liquidity, but in times of stress, this liqui-dity may prove illusory for some funds. Synthetic ETFs also carry <b>additional</b> counterparty and <b>collateral</b> risk. If any of these risks materialized, it could trigger an investor run, which could negatively impact the underlying market as well as other similar funds. The synthetic ETF market in Canada has a high concentration of counterparty risk compared with other jurisdictions. However, given the small size of this market segment, it does not represent a signifi-cant vulnerability for the Canadian financial system. Nonetheless, rapid changes in the ETF market imply that authorities need to monitor developments closely...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of real estate prices on {{corporate}} investment? In the presence of financing frictions, firms use pledgeable assets as collateral to finance new projects. Through this collateral channel, shocks to the value of real estate can have a large impact on aggregate investment. Over the 1993 - 2007 period, the representative U. S. corporation borrows 4 cents of new debt, and invests 6 cents out of each <b>additional</b> dollar of <b>collateral.</b> To compute this sensitivity, we use local variations in real estate prices as shocks to the collateral value of firms that own real estate. We address the endogeneity of local real estate prices using the interaction of interest rates and local constraints on land supply as an instrument. We address the endogeneity of the decision to own land (1) by controlling for observable determinants of ownership and (2) by looking at the investment behavior of firms before and after they acquire land. The sensitivity of investment to collateral value is stronger the more likely a firm is to be credit constrained. ∗We are grateful to Institut Europlace de Finance for financial support.

40|$|This paper studies a {{competitive}} {{general equilibrium model}} with collateralized con-tracts under limited commitment. Even though all conceivable collateralized contracts are allowed, with limited aggregate collateral, risk sharing is imperfect and contract markets are endogenously incomplete. I prove that constrained optimal allocations can be decentralized as a general equilibrium with collateral constraints. I show that the equilibrium exists and that the First and Second Welfare theorem hold. There exists a unique minimal spanning set of collateralized contracts that generates the feasible space and that contains more than the complete set of collateralized Arrow securities. Because the capital good serves as collateral, it has an <b>additional</b> value, called <b>collateral</b> value. The collateral value, which is a risk sharing implication of the model, becomes smaller as more collateralizable capital is available. A positive collateral value implies incomplete risk sharing. I show analytically and numerically that a "sufficiently large" amount of collateral leads to perfect risk sharing and complete markets. An economy endowed with a larger amount of collateral could have {{a greater number of}} contracts traded in equilibrium. The equilibrium allocation and prices are computed numerically using the Pareto problem. The model is used to study the general equilibrium welfare effects of policies aimed at increasing the amount of collateralizable capital...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a {{standard}} environment of adverse selection in credit markets. In our envi-ronment, entrepreneurs who are privately {{informed about the}} quality of their projects need to borrow from banks. As is generally the case in economies with adverse selection, the competitive equilibrium of our economy is shown to be ine ¢ cient. Under adverse selection, the choices made by one type of agents limit what can be o¤ered to other types in an incentive-compatible manner. This gives rise to an externality, which cannot be internalized in a competitive equilibrium. We show that, in this type of environment, the ine ¢ ciency associated to adverse selection is the consequence of one implicit assumption: entrepreneurs can only borrow from banks. If an additional market is added (say, a security market), in which entrepreneurs can obtain funds beyond those o¤ered by banks, we show that the e ¢ cient allocation is an equilibrium of the economy. In such an equilibrium, all entrepreneurs borrow at a pooling rate in the security market. When they apply to bank loans, though, only entrepreneurs with good projects pledge these <b>additional</b> funds as <b>collateral.</b> This equilibrium thus simultaneously entails cross-subsidization and separation between di¤erent types of entrepreneurs...|$|R

40|$|Background. Functional univentricular {{hearts are}} {{currently}} palliated by a staged procedure {{of which the}} bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is usually the second stage. In addition to this stage, a calibrated amount of additional pulmonary blood flow may be preserved to promote pulmonary artery growth and increase {{the length of the}} interval preceding the total cavopulmonary connection. However, additional pulmonary blood flow can be deleterious for ventricular functioning and development as it increases functional ventricular volume load. Methods. Using the Fick principle we devised a theoretic framework to estimate the ventricular volume loading caused by <b>additional</b> pulmonary and <b>collateral</b> aortopulmonary flow. To use this framework, blood samples need to be taken intraoperatively from the aorta, pulmonary veins, and inferior caval vein to determine oxygen saturations. The oxygen saturation samples have to be taken sequentially with and without additional pulmonary blood flow. Results. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a theoretic framework to estimate the ventricular volume loading caused by collateral aortopulmonary flow and additional pulmonary blood flow in the context of a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt in the staged palliation of univentricular hemodynamics. The formulas have not yet systematically been applied in vivo. Conclusions. The added volume loading of the ventricle caused by additional pulmonary blood flow can theoretically be estimated using the newly devised formulas so as to calibrate ventricular volume loading to a desired level intraoperatively.

The degree of collateral circula-tion and diameter of stenosis were determined from the angiograms. The clinical symptoms were expressed in a score of motor deficiencies. In internal carotid artery occlusion no correla-tion of motor deficiency index with angiographically demonstrable collateral circulation was detectable, but there was good correlation with hemispheric CBF and an excellent correlation (P < 0. 001) with the rCBF parameters. In internal carotid artery stenosis no correlation existed between motor deficiency and the degree of stenosis or hemispheric CBF, but good correlation was observed between motor deficiency and the rCBF parameters (P < 0. 01). According to these findings, angiographical demonstration of collateral circulation and of stenosis does not provide as accurate information on impending or already developed tissue in-farction as does rCBF measurement. Presence of hyperemic foci and lack of ischemic foci were related to lesser motor disturbances. Borderlines of 30 ml/ 100 gm per minute for threatening tissue ischemia and of 25 ml/ 100 gm per minute for present tissue ischemia are established.

40|$|In {{almost every}} {{developing}} country Small and Medium enterprises (SMEs) {{are treated as}} the engine for economic growth {{and the availability of}} external finance for them is a topic of significant research interest to academics and policy makers around the globe. SMEs need improved access to finance especially for acquiring capital equipment and applications of new technology for operations. However, their access to finance is restricted because they do not have reliable credit histories, adequate capitalization or <b>additional</b> assets for <b>collateral.</b> Most of the financial institutions are reluctant to provide term loans or cash flow based lending to the SME sector. Thus, SMEs face severe disadvantages while trying to obtain financing relative to larger and more established firms. On the other hand, leasing is an asset-backed, term financing product. It focuses basically on the ability of lessee‟s cash flow generation from their regular business operations to service the lease payment, rather than on the asset base. In this connection, this paper investigates how as an alternative financing mechanism, leasing can be the useful tool in facilitating greater access to finance for SMEs. From the survey of the paper it is found that out of 46. 67 % who got the access into the formal financial institutions only 7. 14 per cent of the enterprises avail the lease facilities. So it is strongly suggested that developing the leasing sector as a means of delivering finance increases the range of financial products in the marketplace and provides a route for accessing finance to SMEs that would otherwise be impossible...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{additional}} information that transcranial Doppler (TCD) can provide {{as part of}} a multimodal imaging stroke protocol in the setting of hyper acute strokes has not been evaluated. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted between December 2012 and January 2015 with ischemic stroke of less than 4. 5 hours of onset were studied as soon as possible with a protocol consisting of noncontrast brain computed tomography, computed tomography angiography of supra-aortic vessels, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and TCD. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were included. The imaging protocol was performed 113. 9 (+/- 23) minutes after the stroke symptoms appeared and by TCD after 150. 2 (+/- 19) minutes. Sixty-six (76. 7 %) patients were treated with revascularization therapies. TCD provided {{additional information}} in 49 cases (56. 9. 4 %, 95 CI 46. 4 - 66. 9). More than one piece of additional information was obtained in 17 patients. The most frequent <b>additional</b> information was <b>collateral</b> pathways, information related to patency of vessels, and active microembolization. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, intracranial vessel occlusion (P <. 001) and optimal sonographic windows (P <. 004) were the variables associated with additional information. In 15 patients (17. 4 %; 95 CI 9. 4 - 25. 5) the additional information changed the management. In 8 patients endovascular rescue was applied after the failure of intravenous thrombolysis; in 5 patients angiography was suspended and in 2 other cases aggressive neurocritical care was indicated.

50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge <b>additional</b> <b>collateral</b> to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements.
