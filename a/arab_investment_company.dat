5000|$|In {{organizing}} the Washington {{portion of the}} mission program, Hollis encountered a series of logistical, scheduling and political hurdles which ultimately required persuasive skills and {{a high degree of}} luck to overcome. For example, during the final hours of the New York program Hollis was forced to procure private corporate jets to fly delegates to the Nation’s capital since their departure from New York was delayed beyond the last shuttle by a United Nations reception quietly slipped into the schedule well after the Washington program of workshops and appointments had been set.
