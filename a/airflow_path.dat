50|$|The 801 used a {{relatively}} complex system, {{integral to the}} BMW-designed, matching forward cowling system, to cool the lubricating oil. A ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheetmetal, to possibly act as a heat sink. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped <b>airflow</b> <b>path,</b> with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine outward and forward within the cowl's frontmost inner area just behind the fan, flowing forward across the oil cooler core in a separate <b>airflow</b> <b>path</b> from the rearwards-direction flow that cooled the engine's cylinders, just to provide cooling for the 801's oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring slightly forward or aft in order to open or close the gap.|$|E

The ESD design for the building demands it to be internally “open ” to allow free natural airflow, and to have minimum mechanical air-handling system.

Fan energy use accounts for a significant portion (e. g., over 50 %) of the HVAC energy use in cleanrooms such as ISO Classes 3, 4, or 5. Three types of air-handling systems for recirculating airflows are commonly used in cleanrooms: (1) fan-tower systems with pressurized plenum, (2) ducted HEPA systems with distributed-fans, and (3) systems with fan-filter units. Because energy efficiency of the recirculation systems could vary significantly from system type to system type, optimizing aerodynamic performance in air recirculation systems appears to be a useful approach to improve energy efficiency in cleanrooms. Providing optimal airflows through careful planning, design and operation, including air change rate, airflow uniformity, and airflow speed, is important for controlling particle contamination in cleanrooms. In practice, the use of fan-filter units (FFUs) in the air-handling system is becoming more and more popular because of this type of system may offer a number of advantages. Often modular and portable than traditional recirculation airflow systems, FFUs are easier to install, and can be easily controlled and monitored to maintain filtration performance.

For the complex field of Under hood Thermal Management, CFD has become a very important tool to engineer the cooling airflow process in the engine bay of vehicles. To model the cooling airflow process accurately in CFD, it is of utmost importance to model all components in the cooling <b>airflow</b> <b>path</b> accurately. These components are the heat exchangers, fan and engine bay blockage effect. This paper presents CFD simulations together with correlating measurements of a cooling airflow system placed in a test rig. The system contains a heavy duty truck louvered fin radiator core, fan shroud, fan ring and fan. Behind the cooling module and fan a 1 D engine silhouette is placed to mimic the blockage done by a truck engine behind the fan. Furthermore a simple hood is mounted over the module to mimic the air guiding done by the hood in an engine bay. The measurements monitor pressure and flow over the system. Supporting this examination {{is a set of}} 48 velocity probes in the radiator that measures the local velocity. The simulations of this system are correlated to measurements. Furthermore to support these simulations, specific simulations and measurements are conducted using the radiator only and the fan only. This is done to see how well each separate component is predicted in CFD and correlated back to measurements. This work is the continuation of work presented in [5] and identified in this paper is that one can simulate the cooling airflow system rather well with steady state CFD. However, fan modeling is sensitive and specific care has to be taken in order for these simulations to be accurate...|$|E
30|$|The {{system is}} being {{developed}} with a solar chimney and a small evaporative cooling wind tower. The evaporative pad provides a large water surface and the pad is wetted by dripping water from the above source. The EC works by a concentric float valve, which opens when the water level is low in the collecting grill, allowing more water to enter. When the water level returns to the full level, the valve is shut automatically. The developed model is implemented in the COMIS-TRNSYS simulation software. This direct evaporative cooling tower used a component no. 506 d-Thermal Energy System Specialist library of TRNSYS 16 (TESS) library which uses wet medium at the top, and this component was assembled and validated by a Thermal Energy System Specialists, USA and was modified in 2004. The present model includes special airflow component which need simultaneous prediction of temperature and airflow rates. In the developed multizone ventilation model, a building is idealized as a system of zones, openings and ducts linked together by discrete <b>airflow</b> <b>paths.</b> Zones are represented by nodes. Chimney and evaporative cooling channels are represented by ducts for resistance and pressure drop calculations. A hydrostatic condition is assumed in zones and the flow rate in each link {{is defined as a}} function of zone pressure, which results in a system of nonlinear equation solver, defined by the mass conservation for each zone [19]. The mathematical equations of the integrated system are discussed in detail with full description of the system in the published paper [16].|$|R
40|$|Cleanroom air-recirculation systems {{typically}} {{account for}} {{a significant portion of}} the HVAC energy use in cleanrooms. High electric power density is normally required for fans to deliver large volume of airflows that were designed, supplied, recirculated, and exhausted within a given time. With the increasing demand for specific contamination control, it is important to optimize design of clean spaces. Best practice in cleanroom air system design includes right-sizing the systems in cleanrooms and adopting minienvironments. Implementing and integrating minienvironments in cleanrooms can improve contamination control and save significant energy. A minienvironment is a localized environment created by an enclosure to isolate a product or process from the surrounding environment. The advantages in using minienvironments include the following: (1) Minienvironments may create better contamination control and process integration. (2) Minienvironments may maintain better contamination control by better control of pressure difference or through use of unidirectional airflows, e. g., cleanliness-class upgrade required for certain process. (3) Minienvironments may potentially reduce energy costs. The use of fan-filter units (FFU) in minienvironments is common. The energy efficiency of such air-delivery systems can vary significantly because of the difference in energy performance, <b>airflow</b> <b>paths,</b> and operating conditions. Simply adding minienvironments with fan-filter units in an existing cleanroom will increase power density and energy intensity for delivering airflow in the space served, if everything else is unchanged. However, by considering contamination control requirements in the various spaces minienvironments can be integrated with the surrounding cleanroom to optimize the overall electric power demand for the facility and to achieve specific cleanliness in each area. In addition, selecting energy efficient minienvironment systems will further improve the overall energy efficiency of the clean spaces...|$|R
40|$|In This Chapter [Designing bleeder systems Examining and {{maintaining}} bleeder systems Evaluating bleeder system effectiveness] INTRODUCTION Bleeder systems are {{that part of}} the mine ventilation network used to ventilate pillared areas in underground coal mines. Pillared areas are those in which pillars have been wholly or partially removed, including the areas where coal has been extracted by longwall mining. Bleeder systems protect miners from the hazards associated with methane and other gases, dusts and fumes, and oxygen deficiency that may occur in these mined-out areas. Effective bleeder systems control the air passing through the area and continuously dilute and move any methane-air mixtures and other gases, dusts, and fumes from the worked-out area away from active workings and into a return air course or {{to the surface of the}} mine. A bleeder system includes the pillared area (including the internal <b>airflow</b> <b>paths),</b> bleeder entries, bleeder connections, and all associated ventilation control devices that control the air passing through the pillared area. Bleeder entries are special air courses designed and maintained as part of the mine ventilation system. [This chapter focuses on the design, examination, maintenance, and evaluation of bleeder systems in underground coal mines. ] The history of coal mine explosions in the United States is a reminder of the importance of adequate ventilation. Some of those disasters were the result of inadequately ventilated pillared areas. The importance of developing bleeder systems to ventilate these pillared areas and evaluating the bleeder system 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s effectiveness is reflected in present-day federal regulations.
