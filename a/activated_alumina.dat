40|$|AbstractGeopolymer is {{the state}} of the art binder in {{concrete}} technology. It utilizes alkaline solution to <b>activate</b> <b>alumina</b> and silica precursors from source material and forms aluminosilicate-based binding material. Nevertheless, the presence of high calcium content in the source material can reduce the performance of geopolymer binder, particularly in terms of its workability performance. The available commercial admixture cannot provide significant improvement to the rapid setting time generated by high calcium in geopolymer system. This research studied the effect of sucrose and citric acid as the proposed natural admixture in fly ash based geopolymer binder. Based on Vicat setting time result, these materials behave oppositely in fly ash-based geopolymer paste. Sucrose tends to increase the setting time of geopolymer paste, while citric acid has an accelerating effect. An unexpected trend is also shown from the relation between porosity and compressive strength of hardened specimen. It appears that the rapid production of geopolymer gels to fill the water-filled voids was not followed by the quality of gel structure. However, these results have presented an encouraging prospect for natural-based material to be developed as the admixture for geopolymer concrete...|$|R

40|$|Precipitation of {{boehmite}} from seeded {{sodium aluminate}} (SA) solutions for production of smelter grade alumina by calcination {{is in the}} early stage of development. However, the reported boehmites are usually well crystallized and actually most boehmites for <b>activated</b> <b>aluminas</b> are poorly crystallized and less ordered forms, which is also called pseudoboehmite. In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} find the appropriate precipitation conditions of pseudoboehmite from seeded SA solutions by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that pure pseudoboehmite showing minor morphology difference with the pseudoboehmite seed can be easily obtained under hydrothermal conditions at 373 K not less than 10 h or at 398 K not less than 3 h. The hydrothermal seed precipitation is a dynamic inhibited process that approximately consists of three stages, namely a fast precipitation stage, a slow precipitation stage and an analogously apparent equilibrium stage. However, the seeded precipitation under circulation reflux at approximate 0. 1 MPa is not suitable for preparing pure pseudoboehmite because of by-products formation, such as gibbsite, nordstrandite, diaspore, etc. This work demonstrates that pseudoboehmite can be efficiently precipitated from seeded SA solutions under certain hydrothermal conditions.

40|$|In this {{research}} project, adsorption is {{considered for the}} separation of CO 2 from CO for applications such as industrial syngas production and in particular to improve {{the conversion of the}} Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process. The use of adsorption technology for these applications requires an adsorbent that can effectively separate out CO 2 from a gas mixture containing CO 2, CO, and H 2. However, adsorption of H 2 is insignificant when compared to both CO 2 and CO, with only CO 2 and CO being the adsorbed species. The adsorption of CO 2 and CO was investigated in this work for four major types of industrial adsorbents which include: <b>activated</b> <b>aluminas,</b> <b>activated</b> carbons, silica gels, and zeolites. Zeolites, with their ability to be fine tuned many parameters which may affect adsorption, were investigated in terms of the effect of the cations present, SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios, and structure to determine how to optimize adsorption of CO 2 while decreasing adsorption of CO. This will help to determine a promising adsorbent for this separation with focus on maximizing the selective adsorption of CO 2 over CO. To investigate this separation three scientific experimental methods were used; gravimetric adsorption isotherm analysis, volumetric adsorption isotherm analysis, and packed bed adsorption desorption breakthrough analysis. Gravimetric and volumetric methods allow for testing the adsorbent with the individual species of CO 2 and CO. This investigation will let us determine the pure component adsorption capacity, heats of adsorption, regenerability, and basic selectivity. Packed bed adsorption breakthrough experimentation was then carried out on promising adsorbents for the CO 2 separation from a mixture of CO 2, CO, and H 2. These experiments used a gas mixture that would be comparable to that produced from the RWGS reaction to determine the multicomponent gas mixture behaviour for adsorption. Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) with a purge gas stream of H 2 was then used to regenerate the adsorbent...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} a broad audience of rural populations affected by drinking arsenic-contaminated water. Exposure to arsenic in the drinking water {{has been associated with}} the development of skin and internal cancers and non-carcinogenic effects such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (Abernathy et al., 593 – 597). Traditional technologies to remove arsenic from water include: coagulation and filtration, <b>activate</b> <b>alumina,</b> ion-exchange, reverse osmosis, and electro-dialysis. These methods are very expensive to build and operate in rural areas with scattered populations. The focus of this research was to remove the arsenic from drinking water by a sorption process. Batch studies were conducted on twelve adsorbent materials with water containing 100 μg/L arsenic (V). The outcome of the research indicates that iron-oxide-coated pumice stone (IOCPS) removes both arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). The arsenic (V) appears to be more easily removed than arsenic (III). In a laboratory column test, the breakthrough volume of the iron oxide coated pumice stone was 4000 bed volumes. The concentration of arsenic in the feed water was 100 μg/L and the effluent concentration was below detection limit (3 ̆c 2 μg/L). Optimum empty bed contact time for arsenic (V) removal by the iron oxide coated pumice stone was 8 to 10 minutes. The optimum pH for arsenic removal by IOCPS was found to be in the range of 5. 5 to 6. 0. The presence of sulfate, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate in the water reduces the arsenic removal capacity of iron-oxide-coated pumice stone. Presence of calcium, magnesium in the water does not effect the arsenic removal by iron oxide coated pumice stone. The residual waste is non-hazardous and can be disposed in landfills. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} of elemental sulfur on porous adsorbents (commercial pre-sulfurised <b>activated</b> carbons and <b>alumina,</b> an HY zeolite and a selenised adsorbent) {{has been observed}} when the adsorbents are exposed to a gaseous stream containing hydrogen sulfide and oxygen. The sulfur deposition from H 2 S is more marked for the activated carbons and the alumina, it is substantially decreased when zeolite is used, and is practically insignificant for the selenium-based adsorbent. For the pre-sulfurised activated carbons, further sulfur deposition is initially beneficial in terms of increasing their mercury chemisorbing capacity but, subsequently, the structural properties are affected and {{this results in a}} drastic reduction in adsorption capacity. Further sulfur deposition on the pre-sulfurised alumina seems immediately to compromise its capacity to chemisorb mercury. The selenium-based adsorbent shows problems with detachment of the fine mercuric selenide powder from the matrix. Sulfur deposition on the initially unsulfurised zeolite improves its mercury adsorption capability. The initially sulfur-free zeolite could be a promising adsorbent for the treatment of this specific type of gas stream. In fact, after a moderate level of sulfur deposition from oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, it can simultaneously chemisorb the mercury vapours by reaction with the sulfur itself while, unlike the <b>activated</b> carbons and <b>alumina,</b> maintaining its required structural properties for a relatively long period...|$|R
