5|$|The 12th SS Panzer Division (by {{the end of}} {{the battle}} the division's {{infantry}} strength had been reduced to that of a battalion)—claimed over the course of two days to have destroyed 103 British and Canadian tanks for the loss of 20. On entering Caen the Anglo-Canadian troops found it in ruins, with four-fifths of the Old City reduced to rubble by the 7 July bombings. The debris that choked the streets made it <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> British armour to manoeuvre through the northern half of the city, preventing Second Army from exploiting I Corps's success. Without possession of the terrain flanking the south of the city, no further gains could be made within Caen so by mid-afternoon on 9 July, Operation Charnwood was over.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. By 1938 it was {{becoming}} <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them. After the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region. Nationalistic and xenophobic people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones. The Madagascar Plan, a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out. Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people. Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in the Porajmos range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.|$|E
5|$|The Nuremberg Laws had a {{crippling}} {{economic and social}} impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed {{due to lack of}} customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.|$|E

Even then Labour would still have been the largest party.|$|R
5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E

50|$|The Lost Highway deal did {{not come}} to be, however, as the band's {{representative}} at the label was fired and things subsequently fell through. The Sinners still had an opening slot on Lucinda Williams' ongoing tour, a slot that was fairly open-ended. Without a label backing them up, however, it was <b>almost</b> financially <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> The Sinners to hit the road. Instead, Ford accepted an invitation to join Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, relegating The Sinners to an indefinite hiatus.|$|R

50|$|Later in 2012, Richards Brothers {{extended}} {{the services that}} terminated at Synod Inn to Aberaeron via the direct route, avoiding New Quay. Passengers for Aberystwth were then expected to change at Aberaeron for Arriva's CymruExpress 40 service, much easier than changing bus at remote Synod Inn. The downside however was that connections to New Quay were lost. This made Cardigan - New Quay journeys <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> save <b>for</b> the handful of existing through services between Cardigan and New Quay (including the evening runs to/from Aberystywth) which were retained.|$|R

Robbins took advantage by enlisting the services of those promoters during that lull in corporate business. The result was that [...] "I Wanna Be A Cowboy" [...] rose to #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, an <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> feat <b>for</b> a small, independent label like Profile.|$|R
25|$|However, Turner {{continued}} to do service to the game in Australia as an administrator right through the early twentieth century. He commented, notably, on how greatly the game in Australia changed after the era in which he played due to a drier climate and improved pitch preparation (and also covering of pitches in Shield matches from the 1930s), which made Australian pitches <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> bowlers of his type and led to reliance on leg spin.|$|E
25|$|The base is {{physically}} located between the emitter and the collector and {{is made from}} lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the electrons injected into the base region to escape without being collected, thus making the resulting value of α very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large β. A cross-section view of a BJT indicates that the collector–base junction has a much larger area than the emitter–base junction.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, a {{road was}} built between El Llano de Huaxquilico to San Pedro Escanela, {{but it is}} {{controversial}} because of environmental concerns. Its building caused severe ecological damage in an area considered {{to be one of}} the most sensitive in the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, as it is where most of the local aquifers recharge.

40|$|Two {{successes of}} old quantum theory are {{particularly}} notable: Bohr’s prediction of the spectral lines of ionised helium, and Sommerfeld’s prediction of the fine-structure {{of the hydrogen}} spectral lines.

25|$|Inayat Khan's mission {{would be}} an {{especially}} dangerous one. So successful had female couriers been that {{the decision was made}} to use them as wireless operators as well, which was even more dangerous work, probably the most dangerous work of all. The job of the operator was to maintain a link between the circuit in the field and London, sending and receiving messages about planned sabotage operations or about where arms were needed for resistance fighters. Without such communication it was <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any resistance strategy to be coordinated, but the operators were highly vulnerable to detection which was improving as the war progressed.|$|E
25|$|One {{point that}} the French had a major problem with was the concept of sanctuary.

In the early 1950s, southern China was used as a sanctuary by Viet Minh guerrillas. Several hit and run ambushes were successfully operated against French Union convoys along the neighboring Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4), which was a major supply way in Tonkin (northern Vietnam). One of the most famous attacks of this kind was the battle of Cao Bằng.|$|E
25|$|The viceroy had to {{overcome}} the distance and poor communication with the royal court in Madrid. It proved <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish viceroys both {{to comply with the}} demands of the crown and to satisfy the aspirations of the Sicilians — a situation that also was apparent in Spain's colonies in Latin America. The viceroys secured territorial control and sought to guarantee the loyalty of vassals through distributing patronage in the form of offices and grants {{in the name of the}} king. The monarchy, however, also exercised its power through royal counsels and independent entities, such as the agents of the Inquisition and visitadores or inspectors. Local spheres of royal influence never were clearly defined, and various local political entities within the viceregal system competed for power, rendering Sicily often ungovernable.|$|E
