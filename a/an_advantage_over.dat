5|$|Critchlow {{was also}} commended for the risky {{decision}} to write, draw and publish the comic himself. The comic was compared favourably with professional quality comics, with {{its lack of}} adverts viewed as <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> those offerings. The high production values were also praised, with the glossy cover and high quality paper used for the inner pages.|$|E
5|$|Damascus {{subsequently}} {{became the}} capital of the Ummayad Caliphate and all of the surplus revenue of the Ummayad Caliphate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the Arab minority of the city <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> the Greek-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.|$|E
5|$|Federer is {{also noted}} for his cool {{demeanour}} and emotional {{control on the}} court. In contrast to his early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> less controlled opponents.|$|E

5|$|The {{two teams}} {{proceeded}} to trade possessions, with no side {{able to gain}} <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> the other's defense. Tech received the kickoff from Georgia, but was again hampered by penalties after earning a first down. After the Virginia Tech punt, Georgia went three-and-out, punting to the Hokies, who also went three-and-out.|$|E
5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> {{the rest of the}} group. He used the whole width of the road and coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down.

50|$|The {{pick and}} roll is often {{employed}} by a shorter guard handling {{the ball and}} a taller forward or center setting the screen; if the taller defender switches to guard the ballhandler, then the offensive team can have favorable mismatches.

5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam {{during the rainy}} season. Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was {{now going to be}} overcome by road improvement and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{along the}} Vimy Ridge were {{accompanied}} by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to tunnelling owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> their French counterparts. British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.|$|E
5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E

It was the 13thrace of the 2008 Formula One season. The 44-lap race was won by Felipe Massa for the Ferrari team, after the initial winner, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton, was penalised for cutting a chicane and gaining <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made available by Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. He chose not to sell virtual currency or power-ups so that those who paid would not have <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> players who didn't. As {{there was no money}} to advertise for the game, the only way to advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, who had more than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E

5|$|In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws give them <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> foxes, {{especially}} when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attack, Richard did not return to the Tower but instead travelled from Mile End to the Great Wardrobe, one of his royal houses in Blackfriars, part of south-west London. There he appointed the military commander Richard FitzAlan, the Earl of Arundel, to replace Sudbury as Chancellor, and began to make plans to regain <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> the rebels the following day. Many of the Essex rebels now began to disperse, content with the King's promises, leaving Tyler and the Kentish forces the most significant faction in London. Tyler's men moved around the city that evening, seeking out and killing John of Gaunt's employees, foreigners and anyone associated with the legal system.|$|E

Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known.|$|E

5|$|The steamer put to sea on 19 November with {{ordnance}} {{stores for}} Fort Pickens, Florida, and {{vessels in the}} Gulf of Mexico, arriving off Southwest Pass, Mississippi River, after 11 December. Joining the Gulf Blockading Squadron at that time, De Soto patrolled for Confederate blockade runners near Barataria Bay. Given the sometimes light winds of the Gulf and inshore waters, the vessel's shallow draft and steam power gave De Soto <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> her mainly sail-powered prey. Cmdr. Walker's first month in the region began poorly, however, when his ship collided with the French war steamer Milan, then adrift off South West Pass, Mississippi River. Although damage to De Soto was slight, the Milan was disabled and thus needed a tow into the Union anchorage.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
