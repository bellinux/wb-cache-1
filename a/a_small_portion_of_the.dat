5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time.

In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance.

Most of the Bosnian Croat TO troops, formally reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) on 8 April, withdrew from the Kupres Plateau towards Šuica, while <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops was forced to retreat via the Mount Cincar towards Livno.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play {{a pivotal role in}} German politics.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel forages undercover, {{to avoid}} being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for {{pursuing}} its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. When food is abundant, only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prey is eaten, usually the brain.

5|$|This {{portion of}} the route of I-8 was {{originally}} part of the proposed state system of highways in 1921. By 1926, this section {{became part of the}} cross-country highway US80.

By 1928, the portion of I-8 between Gila Bend and Casa Grande was designated as SR84. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway was paved near Yuma and SR84 was under construction by the next year.

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen}} from Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total issue. The sharp {{increase in the number}} of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
