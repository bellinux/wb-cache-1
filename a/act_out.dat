5|$|A {{live action}} {{role-playing}} game (LARP) {{is a form}} of role-playing game where the participants physically <b>act</b> <b>out</b> their characters' actions. The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world while interacting with each other in character.

5|$|Sleep {{problems}} are {{a feature of}} the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness (including sudden sleep attacks resembling narcolepsy), disturbances in REM sleep, or insomnia. REM behavior disorder (RBD), in which patients <b>act</b> <b>out</b> dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or DLB.|$|E
5|$|The view of Jinnah in the West {{has been}} shaped to some extent by his {{portrayal}} in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, Gandhi. The film was dedicated to Nehru and Mountbatten and was given considerable support by Nehru's daughter, the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi. It portrays Jinnah (played by Alyque Padamsee) in an unflattering light, who seems to <b>act</b> <b>out</b> of jealousy of Gandhi. Padamsee later stated that his portrayal was not historically accurate.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise <b>act</b> <b>out</b> of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E

5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to <b>act</b> <b>out</b> the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Djajakusuma {{was born}} on 1 August 1918 in Parakan, Temanggung, Central Java, Dutch East Indies, to a priyayi father, Raden Mas Aryo Djojokoesomo, and his wife Kasimah. Djajakusuma was the fifth child of six born to the couple, who lived comfortably off Djojokoesomo's salary as a {{government}} official. While young he enjoyed watching stage performances, such as wayang puppetry and the traditional dance form tayuban; at times he would furtively leave his home after bedtime to watch the productions. With his friends, he would <b>act</b> <b>out</b> the bedtime stories his mother told him. When imported Hollywood films began to be screened, he was an avid viewer, watching Westerns and works starring Charlie Chaplin.|$|E

She contacts her husband Kris Bumstead (Lennie James) and after briefly considering going back to him and dumping Adam, she gets the divorce. After a misunderstanding with Karen, Rachel worries that Adam has stopped finding her sexually attractive, and they agree to indulge in each other's sexual fantasies. Rachel shares her with Adam: to have sex in a shop window. Adam arranges to get the keys to a shop, and he and Rachel <b>act</b> <b>out</b> her fantasy, though are arrested when a ramraider leads the police to them.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to <b>act</b> <b>out</b> his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to <b>act</b> <b>out</b> an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E

5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller <b>act</b> <b>out</b> how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would <b>act</b> <b>out</b> Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E
5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms <b>act</b> <b>out</b> theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E
