25|$|Meanwhile, Ruskin {{was making}} the {{extensive}} sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, The Stones of Venice (1851–53). Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, Stones also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.|$|E

While Singer has previously written at length <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do.

This negated in Collins' mind the justification for its then on-going military actions.|$|E

25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} the debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely {{an expression of}} love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; {{but it was no}} longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
25|$|The British artist potter Bernard Leach {{brought to}} England many ideas he had {{developed}} in Japan with the social critic Yanagi Soetsu <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in his book The Art of the Potter, published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after {{the demise of the}} Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British Utility furniture of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles. One of its main promoters, Gordon Russell, chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and {{he was a member of}} the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the Festival of Britain (1951), the work of the designer Terence Conran (b. 1931) and the founding of the British Crafts Council in the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Hawke had {{two films}} premiered at the 2015 TIFF, both garnering {{favorable}} reviews. In Robert Budreau's drama film Born to Be Blue, {{he played the}} role of jazz musician Chet Baker. The film is set in the late 1960s and focuses on the musician's turbulent career comeback plagued by heroin addiction. His portrayal of Baker was well received; Rolling Stone noted that [...] "Everything that makes Ethan Hawke an extraordinary actor— his energy, his empathy, his fearless, vanity-free eagerness to explore the deeper recesses of a character— is on view in Born to Be Blue." [...] In Rebecca Miller's romantic comedy Maggie's Plan, Hawke starred as an anthropologist and aspiring novelist alongside Greta Gerwig and Julianne Moore.

500|$|When he escapes the {{building}} and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name {{not only because they}} will give away his presence, but also because they remind him of his lost place in society, and he begins [...] "to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him." [...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much time thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gilbert {{had always}} been fascinated by pantomime, {{particularly}} the harlequinade that concluded every pantomime in the early and mid-Victorian era.

Gilbert admired the elegant dancing part of the Harlequin and in 1879 played this character in a pantomime that he co-authored, The Forty Thieves.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates what <b>the</b> {{causes of}} <b>moral</b> beliefs indicate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> epistemic status of those beliefs. I argue that information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> causes of <b>moral</b> beliefs {{can tell us}} whether those beliefs track the truth, and that truth tracking is the primary epistemic property that should concern us in <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> domain. I formulate three novel debunking arguments that employ information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> causes of <b>moral</b> beliefs to support conclusions about truth tracking while minimizing normative assumptions. These arguments lead {{to the conclusion that}} harm-related moral beliefs that hinge on sympathy, moral beliefs influenced by disgust, certain political beliefs, and beliefs about punishment that are subject to the influence of extraneous emotions do not track moral truth. For each of these types of <b>moral</b> beliefs, information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> proximal causes of <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> belief supports epistemic conclusions. I compare the value of information about proximal and distal causes for assessing epistemic status: I argue that proximal causes are a superior source of information, but under certain conditions, we should take information about distal causes into account. In the case of beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fair distribution of resources, information about their proximal causes may be consistent with us tracking truth, but information about their distal, evolutionary origins tell us that we lack reason to think that we track their truth. Thus, using empirical information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> causes of <b>moral</b> beliefs, I offer selective debunking arguments for five types of moral beliefs...|$|R
