We suppose that a digital image A is transformed to another digital image B by a rotation. In the discrete plane, there are many angles giving the rotation from A to B, which we called admissible rotation angles from A to B. For such a set of admissible rotation angles, there exist two angles that achieve the lower and the upper bounds. To find those lower and upper bounds, we use <b>hinge</b> <b>angles</b> as used in [7]. A sequence of <b>hinge</b> <b>angles</b> {{is a set of}} particular angles determined by a digital image in the sense that any angle between two consecutive <b>hinge</b> <b>angles</b> gives the identical rotation of the digital image.

Normal physiologic mechanisms of annular motion are incompletely understood, and more complete characterization {{is needed to}} provide rational basis for annuloplasty ring design and to enhance clinical outcomes. MethodsSeventeen sheep had radiopaque markers implanted; 16 around the annulus and 2 on middle anterior and posterior leaflet edges. Four-dimensional marker coordinates were acquired with biplanar videofluoroscopy at 60 Hz. <b>Hinge</b> <b>angle</b> was quantified between fibrous and muscular annular planes, with 0 ° defined at end diastole, to characterize its contribution to alterations in mitral septal–lateral dimension and 2 -dimensional total annular area throughout the cardiac cycle. ResultsDuring isovolumic contraction (pre-ejection), <b>hinge</b> <b>angle</b> abruptly increased, reaching maximum (steepest saddle shape, change 18 ° ± 13 °) at peak left ventricular pressure. During ejection, <b>hinge</b> <b>angle</b> did not change; it then decreased during early filling (change 2 ° ± 2 °). Septal–lateral dimension and total area paralleled <b>hinge</b> <b>angle</b> dynamics and leaflet distance (anterior to posterior marker). Pre-ejection septal–lateral reduction was 13 % ± 7 % (3. 3 ± 1. 5 mm) from 9 % muscular dimension fall and 18 ° ± 13 ° <b>hinge</b> <b>angle</b> increase. ConclusionsPre-ejection increase in <b>hinge</b> <b>angle</b> contributes substantially to septal–lateral and total area reduction, facilitating leaflet coaptation. Semirigid annuloplasty rings or partial bands may preserve hinge motion, but possible recurrent annular dilatation could result in recurrent mitral regurgitation. Long-term clinical studies are required to determine who might benefit most from preserving intrinsic hinge motion without compromising repair durability...|$|R

The overall fold of this structure, like KIR 2 DL 1, exhibits K-type Ig topology with cis-proline residues in both domains that define β-strand switching, which sets KIR apart from the C 2 -type hematopoietic growth hormone receptor fold. The <b>hinge</b> <b>angle</b> of KIR 2 DL 2 is approximately 80 °, 14 ° larger than that observed in KIR 2 DL 1 despite the existence of conserved hydrophobic residues near the hinge region.

Dans le cadre de l'informatique, l'utilisation des nombres flottants n'est pas recommandée du fait des erreurs de calculs que cela implique. Nous avons donc fait le choix de nous concentrer sur les espaces discrets. Dans le domaine de la vision par ordinateur, la rotation est une transformation requise pour de nombreuses applications. L'utilisation de la rotation continue discrétisée donne des résultats de mauvaise qualité. Pour cette raison, il est nécessaire de développer de nouvelles méthodes de rotation adaptées aux espaces discrets. Nous nous sommes principalement intéressés aux angles charnières qui représentent la discontinuité de la rotation dans les espaces discrets. Dans ces espaces, deux rotations d'une image avec deux angles très proches peuvent donner le même résultat, ce qui est capturé par les angles charnières. L'utilisation de ces angles permet de décrire une rotation qui donne les mêmes résultats que la rotation continue discrétisée tout en n'utilisant que des nombres entiers. Ils permettent aussi de définir une rotation incrémentale qui décrit toutes les rotations possibles d'une image digitale donnée. Les angles charnières peuvent être étendus dans les espaces discrets en trois dimensions. Pour cela, on définit les multi-grilles qui sont des plans de rotations contenant trois ensembles de droites parallèles. Elles représentent les discontinuités de la rotation en 3 D. Les multi-grilles permettent d'obtenir les mêmes résultats en 3 D que ceux obtenus en 2...|$|R

The plasma sheet presents an energy-dependent vertical structure, being thicker by a factor of similar to 2 in the energetic particle range than in the electron plasma. It further exhibits intense dynamical behavior, evident in the energetic neutral atom emission. In two of the four passes, we observe a clear north-south asymmetry, presumably a combined result of vertical plasma sheet motion and short time scale dynamics. Comparison between the 2007 and 2009 passes reveals a clear change in the tilt and vertical offset of the planetary nightside plasma sheet, which progressively becomes aligned to the solar wind direction as we approach Saturnian equinox (August 2009).
