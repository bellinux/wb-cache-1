30|$|Biodiesel washing {{wastewater}} {{anaerobic treatment}} is another option besides coagulation. Similar to coagulation, anaerobic digestion needs to pretreat BWW to reduce G&O and COD (Bezerra et al. 2011). Pretreatment processes allowed efficient COD and G&O reduction using anaerobic treatment; nevertheless, {{high concentrations of}} some chemicals from the pretreatment can be harmful for the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> (Siles et al. 2011). In addition to COD and G&O removal, <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> produces considerable amount of methane, with removals around 278 – 305  mL CH 4 /g COD removed, which is about 88  % of the possible methane yield from COD (Siles et al. 2011; Bezerra et al. 2011).|$|R

50|$|Except in the extremes, {{a muscle}} will fire fibres {{of both the}} aerobic or {{anaerobic}} types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on {{the intensity of the}} contraction. This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic ("fast-twitch") and aerobic ("slow-twitch"), in order to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>processes</b> contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>processes.</b> Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited. In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.|$|E

30|$|<b>Anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> and {{coagulation}} have similitudes in {{the degradation}} level; both processes achieved {{values up to}} 85  %.

40|$|Biochemical methane {{potential}} (BMP) is {{a standard}} test to assess the biogas (including methane) production from the anaerobic digestion of any organic waste. In many anaerobic digestions of sewage sludge, the inoculum to substrate ratio and mixing were variable {{to take into consideration}} for efficient performance. However, the organic content in sewage sludge varied due to the composition of the raw wastewater being treated and the treatment condition. This study is focused on the methane production from the digestion of domestic mixed sewage sludge in the batch reactor at different organic contents. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) was conducted at the inoculum to substrate ratio (I/S) ratio of 2 : 0, each with different organic content. On the termination day of the BMP assay, the sample from each BMP reactor was tested for pH, and alkalinity to determine the status of the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process.</b> Results showed that the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> was stable since the pH remained in the pH range which is suitable for the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> to take place. The <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> was also confirmed stabled as indicated by low value (< 0. 3) of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity ratio (IA/PA).

For the organic content of 0. 68, the maximum methane production rate constant  was 13. 97 mL CH 4 /g VS /hr. For the case of lower organic content, the maximum methane production rate constant was 6. 41 mL CH 4 /g VS /hr.

40|$|The {{sequential}} anaerobic-aerobic {{process was}} applied for PCB biodegradation from plant cuttings. The PCBs were absorbed by plant roots called phytoextraction. The <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> dechlorinated highly chlorinated PCBs (tetra-, penta-, hexa-) to lower chlorinated PCBs (mono-, di-, tri-). Then, the aerobic cultures degraded the low chlorinated PCBs. In the experiment, Aroclor 1254, the commercial PCB mixtures, were used. The culures were fed by methanol (CH 4) as a sole carbon source. The temperature was an essential parameter to control the dechlorinated state. Produced gas from the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> was collected to examine the anaerobic condition. The highly chlorinated PCBs were dechlorinated with different pathways dependent upon the dominant cultures in the process.

50|$|Reservoirs may {{contribute}} {{to changes in the}} Earth's climate. Warm climate reservoirs generate methane, a greenhouse gas when the reservoirs are stratified, in which the bottom layers are anoxic (i.e. they lack oxygen), leading to degradation of biomass through <b>anaerobic</b> <b>processes.</b> At a dam in Brazil, where the flooded basin is wide and the biomass volume is high the methane produced results in a pollution potential 3.5 times more than an oil-fired power plant would be. A theoretical study has indicated that globally hydroelectric reservoirs may emit 104 million metric tonnes of methane gas annually.

50|$|Anaerobic MBRs (sometimes {{abbreviated}} AnMBR) {{were introduced}} in the 1980s in South Africa and currently see a renaissance in research. However, <b>anaerobic</b> <b>processes</b> are normally used when a low cost treatment is required that enables energy recovery but does not achieve advanced treatment (low carbon removal, no nutrients removal). In contrast, membrane-based technologies enable advanced treatment (disinfection), but at high energy cost. Therefore, the combination of both can only be economically viable if a compact process for energy recovery is desired, or when disinfection is required after anaerobic treatment (cases of water reuse with nutrients). If maximal energy recovery is desired, a single anaerobic process will be always superior to a combination with a membrane process.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to pretreatment before anaerobic digestion {{some researchers have}} suggested substrate pretreatment during the <b>anaerobic</b> digestion <b>process.</b> Secondary thermophilic microaerobic treatment (STMT) during anaerobic digestion helps in reset the digestion process by buffering the pH and increasing the microorganism activity, which provides a secondary increase in biomass degradation. This may be a successful solution to improve the low fermentation efficiency during the later stages of the <b>anaerobic</b> digestion <b>process.</b> The effect of STMT on the anaerobic digestion of corn straw improved the VS removal efficiency and afforded a higher methane yield. Similar to microaerobic pretreatment before the <b>anaerobic</b> digestion <b>process,</b> the oxygen supply in STMT during <b>anaerobic</b> digestion <b>process</b> not only reduces the concentration of toxic metabolites (e.g., ethanol, acetic acid and lactic acid) but also promotes the synthesis of certain lipids required for {{the stability of the}} anaerobe cell membrane (Fu et al. 2015 c) as shown in Table  2.|$|R
40|$|Process {{diagnosis}} {{is essential to}} ensure anaerobic fermentation stable and efficient. Here, a novel sensor system combining microbial fuel cell (MFC), gas flow meter and pH meter was developed to evaluate its feasibility for probing the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process</b> established on a model high-rate bioreactor. Repeated transient responses of electrical signal, proton concentration, and gas flow rate, were observed subject to external disturbances. The transient response lasted from < 1 h to 6 h. In addition, MFC obtained compatible signal variations with other sensors, and biofilm MFC (MFCBiofilm) resulted in better agreements than control MFC (MFCControl). These results revealed that 1) the composite sensor system was capable to probe <b>anaerobic</b> <b>process,</b> suggesting a novel approach for process analysis and diagnosis of biogas or biohydrogen production; 2) the variations of sensor signals might provide more valuable information for process diagnosis than sensor signals themselves.
