Reducing sugars, TA, and ascorbic acid content {{were found to}} be higher in the {{processed products}} than the fresh pulp. A significant difference in the antioxidant properties between the fresh <b>apricot</b> <b>pulp</b> and its processed products was observed. The difference in antioxidant properties between the fresh and the processed products may be attributed to the partial degradation of the bioactive compounds by the action of heat during processing. Among the processed products, apricot bar showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Therefore, production of apricot bar could a suitable option for processing of apricots...|$|E

Sea buckthorn berries (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) and apricot fruits (Prunus armeniaca L.) are cultivated and appreciated in Romania both as fresh fruits and as derived products. Characterized by a complex chemical composition, sea buckthorn is rich in unsaturated lipids, carotenoids and tocopherols. Except for β-carotene content, less is known about other lipophilic compounds in apricot fruits. The aim of this paper was to separate and quantify the individual carotenoids, tocopherols and tocotrienols in sea buckthorn, <b>apricot</b> <b>pulp</b> and kernels and also to determine the antioxidant activity of the lipophilic extracts using the TEAC  method.   Chemical characterization of lipophilic extract was performed by HPLC with PDA and fluorescence detection. The total carotenoid content was 17. 19 ± 1. 4 mg/ 100 g F. W. in sea buckthorn; 3. 51 ± 0. 25 mg/ 100 g F. W. in apricot fruits and 0. 58 ± 0. 04 mg/ 100 g F. W. in apricot kernels. The major carotenoids in sea buckthorn were β-carotene, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin esters. Apricots fruits are rich in β-carotene and its geometric isomers while in kernels we could properly identified only lycopene. The α-tocopherol concentration was higher in sea buckthorn (46 mg/kg) than in apricot fruits (1. 09 mg/kg) while apricot kernel contain large amounts of γ-tocopherol (111 mg/kg). Sea buckthorn fruits showed the highest antioxidant capacity, correlated with a high content of both tocopherols and carotenoids. </p...|$|E
