5|$|This line of {{occupation}} of Britain was consolidated {{as one of}} the limites (defensible frontiers) of the empire by its construction. It is a stone fortification built across the width of what is now northern England. The wall was 80 Roman miles (73.5 statute miles or 117 kilometres) long, its width and height dependent on the construction materials which were available nearby. East of the River Irthing the wall was made from squared stone <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> 3metres (9.7ft) wide and 5–6 metres (16–20ft) high, while west of the river the wall was originally made from turf <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> 6metres (20ft) wide and 3.5metres (11.5ft) high; it was subsequently rebuilt in stone. The wall was augmented by various ditches, berms, and forts.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD {{from the}} University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez {{went to work}} for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> stellar rotation.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, observed that Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> 1.5 metres at the withers. The defect was considered to be attributable to poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were among the worst performers.

5|$|During the season, {{tropical}} cyclones were officially {{monitored by}} the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWC) in Nadi, Fiji, Wellington, New Zealand and Brisbane, Australia. Throughout the season the United States Navy also monitored the basin and issued unofficial warnings, through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC). Tropical cyclones that were located between the Equator and 25S were monitored by TCWC Nadi while any that were located {{to the south of}} 25S were monitored by TCWC Wellington. During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160°E and 180° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between 180° and the American coast. TCWC Nadi, Wellington and Brisbane all used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> windspeeds over a 10-minute period, while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1-minute period.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, NASA {{launched}} the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements {{showed that the}} CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations {{at a level of}} 1 part in 104, <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> a residual temperature of 2.726K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.|$|E

50|$|The Metre Convention created {{three main}} {{international}} organizations to facilitate standardisation of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b> The first, the General Conference on Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CGPM), provided {{a forum for}} representatives of member states. The second, the International Committee for Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CIPM), was an advisory committee of metrologists of high standing. The third, the International Bureau of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (BIPM), provided secretarial and laboratory facilities for the CGPM and CIPM.|$|R
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets of metal <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> their deflection {{through the use}} of a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E
5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{performances}} are strung together from the meditative <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> alap (non-metrical introduction) and jor (performance with pulse) in dhrupad style, {{followed by a}} faster and less reserved gat section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla) in khyal style. He experimented with a style of jhala (performance with rapid pulse) developed by Bundu Khan, but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it. The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions. When two gats are used, the first one tends {{to be at a}} slow or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the gats are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle tintal. Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri (a popular light classical genre), which are referred to as mishra (Sanskrit: mixed) because they allow for additional notes, or with a dhun (song based on folk music).|$|E

5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E

He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 Kern County {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} July 21 {{in the southern}} San Joaquin Valley <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale.

A small sector of damage near Bealville corresponded to a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme), though this intensity rating was not representative {{of the majority of}} damage. The earthquake occurred on the White Wolf Fault near the community of Wheeler Ridge and was the strongest to occur in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
40|$|The {{education}} of inspector of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> at the Delft School of Engineering (1843 - 1963)   The Kingdom of the United Netherlands {{was the first}} state in the world which introduced the Metric System in 1820 through the 1816 Act of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b> At first education for the weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> inspectors was not available. After King William II founded the Royal Academy engineering school in Delft in 1842, the school's first director, Antoine Lipkens, who {{took an interest in}} weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> himself, seized the opportunity to establish a course for inspectors of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> in his school. In this two-year course students were trained to become the highest officials in the national Service of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures.</b> The programme was of high quality and continuously adapted to the current state of technology and to the various weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> Acts. The weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> inspectors were qualified and all-round experts. Nevertheless, after the Second World War their work became so complex that specialists from different fields in technical colleges and universities took over their tasks. The occupation of inspector of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> became redundant. Attempts to create a university level education for the inspectors failed. In 1963 the Delft engineering school closed the doors to this programme, which was the end of a unique type of education for a unique occupation. 79...|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced <b>and</b> <b>measured</b> approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
