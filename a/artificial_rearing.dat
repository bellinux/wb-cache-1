40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that early-life gut microbiota composition {{is a crucial}} determinant of the susceptibility to diseases later in life. Understanding the evolution of early-life gut microbiota and critical factors that can modify this microbial community will espouse the prevention or reversion of health risk originating from dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the early stage. In this research, we hypothesized that alterations in the environment (simulation of rural conditions by soil exposure) and feeding mode (breastmilk versus formula milk) will have significant impacts on {{the establishment of the}} gut microbiota in early life. At first, in literature review discipline, we present a holistic view on the current knowledge of gut microbiota and environmental modulations. Then, through empirical studies, we investigate the impacts of soil exposure and different feeding modes on gut microbiota composition. We applied 16 s rRNA sequencing to examine the composition of gut microbiota based on fecal samples in two separate studies: 1) 4 -day-postpartum piglets were exposed to agricultural soil until weaning day (day 21) and then grew under the same conventional condition with control treatments; 2) 4 -day-old piglets were either mother reared and breastfed or <b>artificial</b> <b>reared</b> and formula fed, then grew in the same conditions at weaning.

40|$|Soon after {{parturition}} {{a lasting}} and mutual ewe–lamb bond is established. However, in {{an increasing number}} of intensive sheep farms, lambs are separated from the dam at an early age. When <b>artificial</b> <b>rearing</b> is applied lambs are often kept with mothers for 2 days to allow the ingestion of maternal colostrum and then abruptly removed from their dams. Thus, lambs experience a marked emotional stress represented by the loss of the most relevant social model at this early stage of their behavioural development and a nutritional stress represented by the transition from maternal milk to a commercial milk substitute. These animals when exposed to open field tests show reduced levels of vocalization, are slower to initiate movements, spend less time in ambulatory behaviour and display an increased cortisol response than non-separated animals. In addition, <b>artificial</b> <b>rearing</b> performed on lambs from 2 days of age onward can cause decreased cellular and humoral immune responses. The main oral abnormal behaviour performed by artificially reared lambs is represented by sucking the navel or the scrotum of pen mates. This activity is evident from the initial days on reconstituted milk and lasts until weaning from milk. Attempts have been made to reduce the detrimental effects of early separation. Some of them mainly focus on the emotional aspects (it is recommended not to leave a lamb alone for <b>artificial</b> <b>rearing),</b> others aim at reducing the nutritional impact of <b>artificial</b> <b>rearing</b> (milk intake can be increased by offering a mix of ewe milk and a milk replacer during the first week and then gradually moved to a diet based only on milk substitute which results in higher growth rates). As compared with <b>artificial</b> <b>rearing,</b> early weaning performed at 3 months of age is associated with a later disruption of the mother–young bond and the consequent direct replacement of maternal milk by solid food. However, when they are given the chance, ewes and their lambs form long-term social associations which exceed the age of natural weaning, regarded {{as the end of the}} milk feeding period. Early weaned lambs emit an increased number of high pitched bleats immediately after weaning than before and this increment is still evident 2 days afterwards. Neither partial nor gradual separation from mothers is able to reduce the stress associated with early weaning. In conclusion, premature separation from mothers has clear and marked detrimental effects on various functions in lambs.

40|$|In Tuscany, the red-legged {{partridge}} (Alectoris rufa) became extinct {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century. Recently, some attempts have been made to re-establish wild populations in Tuscany using farm reared birds, but in most cases the released populations have shown difficulties in reaching sufficient viability, even in areas where the habitat can be considered suitable. Modern technologies for rearing game-birds may be not suitable for reintroduction purposes. For this reason we carried out preliminary research to evaluate the survival of red legged partridges reared under natural condition (Natural) compared to those farm <b>reared</b> (<b>Artificial).</b> Natural <b>rearing</b> occurred in a large pen where birds were allowed to mate freely and to nest.

40|$|For {{evolution}} {{and maintenance of}} the social systems of insect colonies, caste production should be controlled in response to external cues so that caste ratio in the colony is kept at an optimal range. Recent developments using <b>artificial</b> diet <b>rearing</b> techniques have revealed an underlying mechanism for adaptive control of caste production in a social aphid, Tuberaphis styraci, which has a sterile soldier caste in the 2 nd instar. Aphid density was the proximate cue that acts on 1 st instar nymphs and embryos to induce soldier differentiation. The final determination of soldier differentiation occurred postnatally, probably at a late 1 st instar stage. Direct contact stimuli from live non-soldier aphids mediated the density effect. While coexisting non-soldiers facilitated soldier differentiation in 1 st instar nymphs, coexisting soldiers acted to suppress such differentiation. These results suggest that caste production in aphid colonies is controlled by positive and negative feedback mechanisms consisting of density-dependent induction and suppression of soldier differentiation. Here, we demonstrate the mechanisms that coordinate aphid society, and provide a striking case of clonal superorganism system where simple responses of colony members to local extrinsic stimuli are integrated into a highly organized regulation of the whole colony...|$|R

Lambs were assigned to three rearing treatments: left with the mother (one lamb per dam), or separated at 3 days of age and fed either with a commercial milk substitute or with milk from Lacaune ewes milked daily. When weaned at 45 days, the lambs of the three treatments were mixed, reared in single sex groups and fed with hay and concentrate. Lambs fed commercial milk had significantly lower growth rate before 22 days than mothered lambs, those fed Lacaune milk being intermediate. No difference was detectable later on and the final weight was similar. Artificially reared lambs, regardless of the type of milk, seemed more active in their rearing pens and less afraid of humans in tests performed at 21 days. The fleece around the perianal area of lambs fed commercial milk tended to be dirtier than in lambs fed with ewe’s milk without any increase on the presence of pathogens in the faeces.

To develop the technology of sponge aquaculture, protocols for artificial seed production need to be established. To understand larval release and settlement under artificial controlled environments, a model marine sponge Hymeniacidon perlevis was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. The larval release of H. perlevis is an asynchronous event in the laboratory-controlled environment Sponge explants attached on substrata release 5 times more larvae than unattached sponge explants. Over the course of 12 days of release, the mean release rate was 7. 2 larvae g(- 1) wet sponge day(- 1) for attached sponges. Over the course of 7 days of release for unattached sponges, the mean release rate was 2. 6 larvae g(- 1) wet sponge day(- 1). Light (6000 lx) stimulated the sponges to release more larvae than did dark incubation. The highest number of sponge larvae (195. 8 larvae g(- 1) wet sponge) was released at 18 degrees C, while only 48 and 51. 7 larvae g(- 1) wet sponge were released at 14 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively.
