5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into <b>an</b> <b>ulcer.</b> The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: The {{effect of}} <b>a</b> foot <b>ulcer</b> on {{health-related}} {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) of patients with diabetes mellitus and their caregivers is unclear, and was therefore evaluated prospectively in this multicentre study. Methods: HRQoL according to the 36 -item health-related quality of life questionnaire (SF- 36) of 294 patients (ulcer duration >= 4 weeks) and 153 caregivers was analysed at baseline (time-point zero [T 0]), once the ulcer was healed or after 20 weeks (time-point 1 [T 1]), and 3 months later (time-point 2 [T 2]). Patients with severe ischaemia were excluded. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 60 years, 72 % were male, and time since diagnosis of diabetes was 17 years. Patients reported a low HRQoL on all SF- 36 subscales. At T 1, HRQoL scores in physical and social functioning were higher in patients with a healed vs <b>a</b> non-healed <b>ulcer</b> (p < 0. 05). At T 2, these differences were larger, with higher scores for physical and social functioning, role physical and the physical summary score (all p < 0. 05). Within-group analysis revealed that HRQoL improved in different subscales in patients with <b>a</b> healed <b>ulcer</b> and worsened in patients with <b>a</b> persistent <b>ulcer</b> from T 0 to T 2 (all p < 0. 05). The caregivers of patients with <b>a</b> persisting <b>ulcer</b> had more emotional difficulties at T 2. Conclusions/interpretation: Diabetic patients with <b>a</b> healed foot <b>ulcer</b> had <b>a</b> higher HRQoL than patients with <b>a</b> persisting <b>ulcer.</b> Healing of <b>a</b> foot <b>ulcer</b> resulted in <b>a</b> marked improvement of several SF- 36 subscales 3 months after healing (from T 0 to T 2).

25|$|Skin cancers are cancers {{that arise}} from the skin. They are due to the {{development}} of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread {{to other parts of the}} body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with <b>an</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form <b>an</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds.|$|E

25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from <b>an</b> <b>ulcer</b> protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E
25|$|Buruli ulcer is an {{infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The {{early stage of}} the infection is characterised by a painless nodule or area of swelling. This nodule can turn into <b>an</b> <b>ulcer.</b> The ulcer may be larger inside than at {{the surface of the}} skin, and can be surrounded by swelling. As the disease worsens, bone can be infected. Buruli ulcers most commonly affect the arms or legs; fever is uncommon.|$|E

25|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{infection}} in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms <b>an</b> <b>ulcer</b> {{with a black}} center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Acceleration of wounf {{healing is}} intrested because of {{decreasing}} {{the risk of}} wound complication and infections as well as reducing the cost of treatment. In animal models, it has been proved that estrogen can accelerate wound healing. It has been also suggested that topical estrogen can eliminate effect of aging on wound healing and can increase the speed of wound healing in old people. &# 13; Methods: We selected 16 young healthy people who developed symmetrical and ulcers (regarding size and depths) after dermabrasion, shave and electrocoagulouzon and CO 2 laser. Primary lesions of patients were benign and noninfective. Identical and symmetrical lesions of each patient were randomly {{divided into two groups}} (A and B). Topical estrogen with concentration of 0. 625 mg/g in the base of silver sulfadiazine cream was applied to <b>A</b> <b>ulcers</b> and silver sulfadiazine cream alone was applied on B ulcers. Ulcers were dressed by Telfa gauzes. The <b>A</b> <b>ulcers</b> of each patients were compared to counterpart B ulcers in regard of redness, size, depth, general appearance of ulcers and wound healing duration at three days intervals by a physician. &# 13; Results: Average time of healing was 10. 8 days and 8. 5 days for B (n= 29) and <b>A</b> (n= 29) <b>ulcers,</b> respectively (P < 0. 001). In 78 percent of cases, the <b>A</b> <b>ulcers</b> were judged better than B ulcers by physician (P < 0. 01). &# 13; Discussion: It seems that estrogen not only accelerate healing of acute ulcers but also it is efficient in young healthy people who don"t have any hormonal or wound healing problems...|$|R
