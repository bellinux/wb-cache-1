He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone Hotel was {{designed}} by architect Benjamin Marshall, of Marshall and Fox, in 1909. Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building. According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development, the hotel's exterior and interior are considered <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture; the nomination form for the building's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire. However, the two styles are related, and the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools. The design was influenced by Marshall's trip to Paris, after which he completed the hotel.|$|E

The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 {{are the most important}} monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.|$|E

50|$|Although the ILLIAC travails {{ended in}} uninspiring results, {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} reasons for the difficulties of the ILLIAC IV architecture pushed forward research in parallel computing. Illiac IV {{was a member of the}} class of parallel computers, referred to as SIMD (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data stream), essentially an array processor. During the 1980s, with the falling processor cost predicted by Moore's Law, a number of companies created MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) to build even more parallel machines, with compilers that could make better use of the parallelism. The Thinking Machines CM-5 is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>examples</b> of the MIMD concept.|$|R
