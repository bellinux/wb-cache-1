40|$|The density {{distributions}} {{of the three}} refractory elements Ti <b>II,</b> Ca <b>II,</b> <b>and</b> Fe <b>II</b> away from the Galactic plane are compared with the distribution of hydrogen and dust by examining plots of N s in b versus z. It is found that Ti <b>II</b> <b>and</b> Ca <b>II</b> are considerably more extended in z than the H I and dust <b>and</b> that Fe <b>II</b> has an intermediate extension. Although the results are strongly influenced by sample bias, the indicated exponential scale heights for the data sample are h(Ti II) not less than 2 kpc, h(Ca II) = 1 kpc, h(Fe II) = 0. 5 kpc, H(H I) = 0. 3 kpc, and h(E/B-V) = 0. 1 kpc. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Ti <b>II</b> <b>and</b> Ca <b>II</b> are much more smoothly distributed in space than the hydrogen or dust. The large scale heights for Ti <b>II</b> <b>and</b> Ca <b>II</b> <b>and</b> their smooth distributions are most easily understood as {{the effect of a}} mixture along the line of sight of two H I phases namely, a diffuse cloud phase, in which nearly all of the Ti and Ca are tied up in dust, and an intercloud medium, where refractory elements are less depleted. It is found that Ti <b>II</b> <b>and</b> Ca <b>II</b> mostly trace the smoothly distributed intercloud medium.
