500|$|Governor Stanley {{opened the}} Assembly's special session on August 27 by declaring that Virginia faced [...] "the gravest problem since 1865".

500|$|In {{the first}} of these cases, Socialist Party of America {{official}} Charles Schenck had been convicted under the Espionage Act for publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft. Schenck appealed, arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Schenck's appeal and affirmed his conviction. This conviction continued to be debated over whether Schenck went against the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., writing for the Court, explained that [...] "the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent." [...] One week later, in Frohwerk v. United States, the court again upheld an Espionage Act conviction, this time that of a journalist who had criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the special session resumed on September 4, the number of bills filed for {{consideration}} by the Assembly had risen to more than 70. Stanley's supporters led off the debate in both chambers of the Assembly, but Stanley's political position had weakened and media observers {{felt that he was}} close to compromising even further on his program. On September 6, Stanley's backers introduced a new bill in the Assembly which would give the governor the power to make pupil assignments. The new bill expanded on the limited criteria previously proposed by the governor by declaring that pupil assignment would be made in order to ensure [...] "efficient" [...] (e.g., segegrated) operation of the schools and to reduce <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> danger to the public safety of citizens in those districts which integrated. In an effort to strengthen the Stanley plan's interposition elements, the bill also authorized circuit courts to file injunctions against any school district which violated the assignment decrees—which invited the prospect of pitting state courts against federal ones. Delegate Thomson introduced a bill to establish a seven-member Assembly committee to investigate any group seeking to influence public opinion in the state, teacher quality, uniformity of courses and curriculum in the public schools, and the effects of integration on public education.|$|E

50|$|Some {{of these}} {{stressors}} and stimulus {{that must be}} neutralized come from {{the environment of the}} Italian crested newt. T. carnifex lives in an open aquatic environment relatively close to human activity, which makes it prone to sewage leakages. It is noted that the absorption of the direct environment is a daily part of T. carnifexs life. This being said, it is clear that should there be toxins in the aquatic environment of the newt, it is highly likely and probably guaranteed that they will be absorbed into the body of T. carnifex. Chemicals such as nonlyphenol and ethoxylate, which are endocrine disruptors, are two of many found in the newts environments, and are considered the most toxic when transformed by microorganisms. This <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> very <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> problem, because once these chemicals enter the skin, they become integrated into the newt’s bodily functions and can cause great harm to the animal. Because T. carnifex osmoregulates mostly through transepithelial movement of water and solutes, this is probably the largest physiological challenge faced by the newt.|$|R
40|$|Executive summary This {{briefing}} {{provides an}} analysis of challenges facing the sustainability {{and development of the}} academic workforce in Australia. It draws together insights from national statistics collections and a number of recent studies, sheds light on current characteristics of the academic profession, and identifies key problem areas. From a review of the evidence, we argue that {{now is the time for}} both policy action at the national and institutional level to address these problems, and for further research that can inform workforce planning and development in the years to come. Over the last few decades university education has become an important pillar of Australia’s advanced economy. Australia’s innovative capacity hinges in large measure on the talents of its university graduates, and the people who educate and train these graduates – academic staff – sustain the core business of the country’s future. There is <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> imperative to develop a cogent strategy for planning and building the academic workforce. Our review of the evidence shows that: • there is <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> <b>present</b> <b>and</b> growing demand for academic work, a demand bein...|$|R

40|$|Product market reform (i. e. liberalization, or deregulation, {{of product}} markets) in Europe is considered, {{in a recent}} book edited by Tito Boeri et al. (2006), from three major perspectives: for its spread and timing (an {{empirical}} matter); for its efficiency justification, impact and further potential (a normative — welfare-economic — question); for its political conditions (an issue of public choice and political economy). Thus, the book considers {{a number of issues}} — possibly too large a number, as a vast and complex matter is squeezed into a mid-sized book (336 pages in all). The multiple authorship (involving contributions to the main text and comments on it by a number of academics and researchers) does not help, as it results into uneven treatment and considerable discontinuities. At the same time, however, the book is interesting and useful, in that it singles out extremely relevant issues, offers new and penetrating insights, <b>and</b> delivers <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> (<b>and,</b> to the <b>present</b> reviewer, convincing) policy message.

40|$|Identification of {{resources}} {{that will be}} a source of competitive advantage is not a simple task for today’s firms, since many of the characteristics attributed to them can only be intuitively perceived. The available competence frameworks capture the competence requirements for <b>a</b> family of <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> jobs. In <b>a</b> fast moving business world of new products and technology, companies are grappling with the requirement to generate, acquire and internalize newer competence required for future products. This study examines Anticipatory Competence Building (ACB) as an essential moderator between Technology Competence Obsolescence (TCO) and Organisational Health (OH) in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. In this paper, we argue that ACB can be developed into a measurement model with five distinct dimensions, namely Competence obsolescence, Future competence, Technology research, Market orientation and Competence renewal. The data is consolidated using the Delphi technique with the opinions of experts from diverse fields within Malaysia. The study ratified an ACB model consisting second order constructs with 17 factors which collectively influence the degree of TCO and OH in an Organization. These factors are itemized to convert the model into a survey based instrument of measure. The model gives practitioners a refreshed look at the current competency framework to be wary about the imminent and essential future competencies...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} two {{approaches}} to a rigorous mathematical and algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in constraint-based natural language processing. The first approach, called quantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> logical framework, <b>and</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> sound <b>and</b> complete system of quantitative inference for definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines a rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective weights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The second approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces a log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic program and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and properties of such probability models from incomplete, i. e., unparsed data. The possibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as {{properties of the}} log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate parameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary context-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these ideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we {{address the problem of}} computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in the inference task <b>and</b> <b>present</b> various techniques to approximately solve this task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for the most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs.

In evidence Sergeant Jackson said he made this decision {{in a desperate attempt to}} neutralize John Carthy as a threat without killing him.

40|$|In (FEMA 308 in Repair of {{earthquake}} damaged {{concrete and}} masonry wall buildings, Prepared by ATC for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington DC, 1998) a general framework facilitating decisions on appropriate {{course of action}} (accept damage, restore, or upgrade) for damaged buildings after an earthquake was presented. Such Performance-Based Policy Framework relies on performance index of the building in its intact and damaged state and on the relative performance loss as significant indicators for repair and/or upgrade decisions; however, no specific guidance {{for the establishment of}} PL and IP thresholds governing damage acceptability was given. This paper proposes an improvement of the PBPF introduced in FEMA 308 by providing it with a set of performance thresholds that can be established based on <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> quantitative approach <b>and</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> set of tools for its practical implementation with reference to Reinforced Concrete frame buildings.

Finally, a case study demonstrates the application of the hypothesized policy framework for a Municipality in southern Italy and investigates on the effects of varying decision thresholds on the total reconstruction costs and mean safety level for the considered building stock...|$|R
40|$|Software {{engineering}} research is maturing and papers increasingly support their arguments with empirical {{data from a}} multitude of sources, using statistical tests to judge if and to what degree empirical evidence supports their hypotheses. This paper <b>presents</b> trends <b>and</b> current state of art regarding statistical maturity in empirical software {{engineering research}}; the objective being {{the development of a}} statistical maturity model. First, we manually reviewed papers from four well-known and top ranked journals producing a review protocol along with the view of current (2015) state of art concerning statistical maturity, practical significance and reproducibility of empirical software engineering research. Our protocol was then used as ground truth, i. e., training set, for a semi-automatic classification of studies for the years 2001 [...] 2015 using a total of 3, 011 papers. We used the extracted data to develop a statistical maturity model which also includes a model for how to argue for practical significance. The statistical maturity of empirical software engineering research has an upward trend in certain areas (e. g., use of nonparametric statistics, but also more generally in the usage of quantitative analysis). However, we also see how our research area currently often fails to connect the statistical analysis to practical significance. For instance, we argue that conclusions should explicitly state contributions to software engineering practice, e. g., the return on investment for practitioners. We argue that the statistical maturity model can be used by researchers and practitioners to build a coherent statistical analysis and guide them in the choice of statistical approaches of its steps. The final goal for a researcher would be to, in <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> way, <b>present</b> <b>and</b> argue for the practical significance of their findings. Bayesian analysis, we believe, has a role to play in this. Comment: Draft of submission to Special Issue for Information and Software Technolog...|$|R
