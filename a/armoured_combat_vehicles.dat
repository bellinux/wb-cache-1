5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{different}} <b>armoured</b> <b>combat</b> <b>vehicles</b> were developed on the T-26 chassis in the 1930s. Among them were KhT-26, KhT-130 and KhT-133 flame-throwing (chemical) tanks (552, 401 and 269 vehicles were produced, respectively); T-26T artillery tractors (197 were produced); TT-26 and TU-26 remotely controlled tanks (162 teletanks of all models were produced); ST-26 bridge-laying tanks (71 were produced); SU-5 self-propelled guns (33 were produced); experimental armoured cargo/personnel carriers, reconnaissance vehicles, and many others. The majority of these vehicles were developed at the Leningrad Factory of Experimental Mechanical Engineering (from 1935 known as the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov) by talented Soviet engineers P.N. Syachentov, S.A. Ginzburg, L.S. Troyanov, N.V. Tseits, B.A. Andryhevich, M.P. Zigel and others. Various vehicle-mounted equipment was developed for the T-26, including mine-clearing attachments, inflatable pontoons and a snorkel system for fording water obstacles, devices for overcoming obstacles and many others. T-26 light tanks were also modified into different <b>armoured</b> <b>combat</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the field during wartime.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June 1941, the Red Army had 10,268 T-26 light {{tanks of}} all models on their inventories, {{including}} <b>armoured</b> <b>combat</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{based on the}} T-26 chassis. T-26s composed {{a majority of the}} fighting vehicles in Soviet mechanised corps of the border military districts. For instance, the Western Special Military District had 1,136 T-26 tanks on 22 June 1941 (52 percent of all tanks in the district). The T-26 (mod. 1938/39, especially) could withstand most German tanks in 1941 but were inferior to the Panzer III and Panzer IV participating in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and all of the Red Army's tank models suffered severe losses due to the air supremacy of the German Luftwaffe. The majority of the Red Army's T-26s were lost in the first months of the German-Soviet War, mainly to enemy artillery and air attacks. Many tanks broke down for technical reasons and lack of spare parts.|$|E

25|$|The T-26 {{formed the}} {{backbone}} of the Red Army's armoured forces during the first months of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. On 1 June, the Red Army had 10,268 T-26 tanks of all models, including <b>armoured</b> <b>combat</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on the T-26 chassis. The T-26 made up 39.5 percent of the tank strength, by number. T-26s composed a majority of fighting vehicles in Soviet mechanized corps of border military districts. For example, the Western Special Military District had 1,136 T-26 tanks on 22 June 1941 (52% of all tanks in the district). Mechanized corps of the Southwestern Front (formed from units of Odessa Special Military District and some units of Kiev Special Military District after the beginning of the war) were equipped with 1,316 T-26 tanks, making up 35% of all tanks on the front. All in all there were 4,875 T-26 tanks in western military districts on 1 June 1941. However, some T-26 tanks were not operationally ready because of shortages of parts like batteries, tracks, and road wheels. Such shortages left around 30% of available T-26 tanks disabled. Additionally, about 30% of the available T-26 tanks had been produced in 1931–1934 and had limited service life. Thus five Soviet western military districts had about 3,100–3,200 T-26s of all models in good order (approximately 40% of all tanks in the districts in question), which was only slightly less than the number of German tanks intended for invasion of the USSR.|$|E

5000|$|More than 50 {{different}} modifications {{and experimental}} vehicles {{based on the}} T-26 light infantry tank chassis were developed in the USSR in the 1930s, with 23 modifications going into series production.

They were developed at the Leningrad Factory of Experimental Mechanical Engineering (from 1935 known as the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov) by talented Soviet engineers P.N. Syachentov, S.A.

40|$|Abstract-Eye {{tracking}} {{has been}} an important interesting area of research for quite some time now. In day-to-day applications, eye-tracking {{can be used as a}} computer Interface for both industrial and non-industrial applications. Here it mainly focuses the controlling of firing systems with the help of eye movement and blink. A military tank is an invaluable armoured fighting unit for front-line combat which incorporates both defensive and offensive capabilities. Most of the modern tanks require 4 members to operate, i. e. commander, driver, gunner and loader (Optional). Thus, when a tank gets destroyed, four precious lives are lost. In order to avoid such loss, number of persons to operate the <b>armoured</b> <b>combat</b> <b>vehicle</b> is reduced. The number of members required for operating a tank by one as well as increases the easiness of targeting an enemy by implementing a new method of controlling the tank’s turret by eye tracking. Image of eye is captured using a camera, which is placed in front of the eye. The turret position is controlled using the eyeball movement and the gun can be fired with the help of blink. This will help in attacking the enemy quickly. Also, the number of persons required to control the tank is reduced...|$|R
