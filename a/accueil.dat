25|$|The <b>Accueil</b> Notre Dame {{was built}} to replace the two older Accueils that were present within the Domain. The old <b>Accueil</b> Notre Dame stood {{opposite}} the Underground Basilica, and has been extensively remodelled, being divided into two buildings by removing a section. One building now contains the Chapel of Reconciliation, {{which used to be}} the refectory, and also houses the convent of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers. The other section is now known as the <b>Accueil</b> John Paul II, and contains several chapels (e.g. St Cosmos & St Damien), the First Aid post and Dispensary, and the offices of the Hospitalité. The other was the <b>Accueil</b> St. Bernadette, which stood across the river from the old <b>Accueil</b> Notre Dame, and was demolished {{to make way for the}} new one.|$|E
25|$|Since Easter 1997 sick pilgrims {{from all}} over the world have been housed in the <b>Accueil</b> Notre Dame, an airy modern building. The <b>Accueil</b> is {{organised}} into two wings, each consisting of six storeys, with the Reception area on the ground floor and the Transit Lounge on the fifth. Each floor from one to four is named after a specific saint, with female saints honoured on one side and male ones on the other. Each floor has a central refectory area where pilgrims congregate to eat.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1985, {{to commemorate}} the tricentenary of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, President François Mitterrand of France {{announced}} a formal apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world. At the same time, the government released a special postage stamp in their honour reading [...] "France {{is the home of}} the Huguenots" [...] (<b>Accueil</b> des Huguenots).|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more gracious than the <b>accueil</b> of this lady. She paid me many {{handsome}} compliments about my literary work--asked most affectionately for dear Mrs. Pendennis and the dear children--and then, as I expected, coming to business, contrasted the happiness and genteel position of my wife and family with the misery and wrongs of her own blessed child and grandson. She never could call that child by the odious name which he received at his baptism. I knew what bitter reasons she had to dislike the name of Thomas Newcome.|$|E
6000|$|I made Sampson {{announce}} {{our marriage}} in the papers. (My wife used to hang down her head before the poor fellow afterwards.) I took Mrs. Warrington back to my old lodgings in Bloomsbury, where {{there was plenty of}} room for us, and our modest married life began. I wrote home a letter to my mother in Virginia, informing her of no particulars, but only that Mr. Lambert being about to depart for his government, I considered myself bound in honour to fulfil my promise towards his dearest daughter; and stated that I intended to carry out my intention of completing my studies for the Bar, and qualifying myself for employment at home, or in our own or any other colony. My good Mrs. Mountain answered this letter, by desire of Madam Esmond, she said, who thought that for the sake of peace my communications had best be conducted that way. I found my relatives in a fury which was perfectly amusing to witness. The butler's face, as he said, [...] "Not at home," [...] at my uncle's house in Hill Street, was a blank tragedy that might have been studied by Garrick when he sees Banque. My poor little wife was on my arm, and we were tripping away, laughing at the fellow's <b>accueil,</b> when we came upon my lady in a street stoppage in her chair. I took off my hat and made her the lowest possible bow. I affectionately asked after my dear cousins. [...] "I--I wonder you dare look me in the face!" [...] Lady Warrington gasped out. [...] "Nay, don't deprive me of that precious privilege!" [...] says I. [...] "Move on, Peter," [...] she screams to her chairman. [...] "Your ladyship would not impale your own husband's flesh and blood!" [...] says I. She rattles up the glass of her chair in a fury. I kiss my hand, take off my hat, and perform another of my very finest bows.|$|E
