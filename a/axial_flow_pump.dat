50|$|Centrifugal pump {{impellers}} have specific speed values ranging from 500 to 10,000 (English units), with radial <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> at 500-4000, mixed flow at 2000-8000 and <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> at 7000-20,000.

50|$|Axial-flow pumps {{have small}} diameters but give {{relatively}} modest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> {{work well with}} low-density fluids. Centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high-density fluids but require large diameters for low-density fluids.|$|R

50|$|The HeartAssist5 is an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> and the {{smallest}} of the full-flow LVADs. Its pump is slightly larger in diameter than a U.S. quarter or one-Euro coin and weighs only 3.2 ounces (92 grams). The small size allows for the device to be implanted adjacent to the heart and above the diaphragm; this is unique among LVADs.|$|E
50|$|This concept utilises an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> {{to force}} the water {{from one side of}} the ship to other rather than {{allowing}} it to slosh as in passive systems. Webster (1967) studied the design of such a tank in detail. The main disadvantage to this is that when the pump is operated there is a time lag for a sizeable amount of fluid to arrive at a tank, thus limiting instant roll stabilization. Hence, compared to fin stabiliser systems, this is highly inefficient.|$|E

50|$|An <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> has a propeller-type of {{impeller}} {{running in}} a casing.The pressure in an AFP is developed by the flow of liquid over the blades of impeller. The fluid is pushed in a direction {{parallel to the shaft}} of the impeller, that is, fluid particles, in course of their flow through the pump, do not change their radial locations. It allows the fluid to enter the impeller axially and discharge the fluid nearly axially. The propeller of an AFP is driven by a motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> {{is shown in}} the figure. As shown in the figure, the head at the zero flow rate can be as much as three times the head at the pump’s best efficiency point. Also, the power requirement increases as the flow decreases, with the highest power drawn at the zero flow rate. This characteristic is opposite to that of a radial flow centrifugal pump where power requirement increases with an increase in the flow. Also the power requirements and pump head increases with an increase in pitch, thus allowing the pump to adjust according to the system conditions to provide the most efficient operation.|$|E
50|$|Continuous-flow VADs {{are smaller}} and {{have proven to}} be more durable than pulsatile VADs. They {{normally}} use either a centrifugal pump or an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump.</b> Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated {{in the direction of the}} rotor's axis.|$|E

50|$|A pump-jet {{works by}} having an intake (usually {{at the bottom}} of the hull) that allows water to pass {{underneath}} the vessel into the engines. Water enters the pump through this inlet. The pump can be of a centrifugal design for high speeds, or an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> for low to medium speeds. The water pressure inside the inlet is increased by the pump and forced backwards through a nozzle. With the use of a reversing bucket, reverse thrust can also be achieved for faring backwards, quickly and without the need to change gear or adjust engine thrust. The reversing bucket can also be used to help slow the ship down when braking. This feature is the main reason pump jets are so maneuverable.|$|E
5000|$|An Act {{to enclose}} the fen {{land in the}} parish of Branston was {{obtained}} in 1765, and another for the parish of Potterhanworth in 1774. This also gave the Commissioners powers to build banks, engines and sluices. A third Act was obtained in 1789, which authorised the embanking of 5850 acre in Nocton, Potterhanworth and Branston. It included provision for enlarging the Car Dyke, and raising its eastern bank. In 1812, the Witham was straightened by cutting the South Delph, and the part of Branston parish which was now on the east bank of the Witham became known as Branston Island. Drainage was by a wind engine, {{but this was not}} adequate for the job, and in 1832 a further Act was obtained to allow a steam engine to be used. The Witham Commissioners thought that the extra volume of water and the speed with which it would be pumped would damage the river banks, and sought an injunction to prevent the use of steam power. This was refused, and a [...] engine was installed. Much of the fen was flooded in 1862, when a 156 ft section of the South Delph flood bank failed. The Great Northern Railway Company, who owned the Witham at this time, argued that although the river was their responsibility, the bank was not, as it was not specifically mentioned in the 1812 Act. However, Lincoln Assizes decided differently, and awarded damages to those affected by the flood. The engine was replaced by a Marshall steam engine and 36 in Gwynnes pump sometime in the early twentieth century, which was itself replaced by a Ruston oil engine in 1940. An Allen-Gwynnes electric motor driving a 24 in <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> was installed in 1956.|$|E
