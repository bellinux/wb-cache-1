40|$|West Africa {{is known}} for having {{experienced}} major drought events, but during the last decades numerous floods and exceptional inundations have also struck the region. The flood management is now a major concern for West African countries. Floods can occur at different temporal and spatial scales associated either with meso-scale convective systems that can generate exceptional rainfall totals over a small surface area (<b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of <b>km(2))</b> during {{a short period of}} time (<b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours), or with 5 to 20 days rainfall accumulations over a large part of the region that cause unusual flooding over large scale watersheds. Intensity-Duration-Area-Frequency (IDAF) curves are interesting tools for two reasons: they are useful for hydraulic structures design as they provide estimates of the return level of heavy rains for several temporal and spatial aggregations and they are helpful to characterize the severity of storms. Obtaining such curves from rainfall networks requires long series, high spatial density and high time-frequency of records. In West Africa, such characteristics are provided by the AMMA-CATCH Niger network. This network is located in the Niamey region where 30 recording rain-gauges (5 minutes series) have operated since 1990 over a 16000 km(2) area. In this study, the IDAF curves are obtained by separately considering the time (IDF) and the spatial (ARF) scales. Annual maxima intensities are extracted for different spatial and temporal resolutions. The IDF model used is based on the concept of scale invariance (simple scaling) to normalize the different temporal resolution of maxima series to which a global GEV is fitted. This parsimonious framework allows using the concept of dynamic scaling to describe the ARF. The IDAF curves obtained describe the distribution of extreme rainfall for time resolutions ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours and space scales between 1 km 2 and 2500 km(2) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} model, called PEGASE (Planification Et Gestion de l’ASsainissement des Eaux), {{is devoted}} to the characterization of the environmental state of surface water, from a local scale (<b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>km²)</b> up to a of a global scale (internationals districts, hundreds of thousands km²). The model is able to simulate non stationary scenarios for entire river trees (hundreds to thousands of water bodies). The model is a tool to validate and check consistency of data at district (and thus international) level. The flexibility of the model enables to choose the time (daily to yearly periods) and spatial (watershed, water body, district, region, country…) scales of the expected results. In the context of the international coordination for the Water Framework Directive, the PEGASE model is used as a tool specifically addressed to simulate the IRBD (International River Basin District) Meuse. Indeed, the model: (i) is associated to a dedicated transnational database to apply the model to the entire district; (ii) is operational, the Meuse application has been calibrated and validated independently at this stage on most of regional sub-basins of the district; (iii) could be used to simulate –at that scale– historic and future scenarios to estimate water quality improvement that may be expected after applying basic and complementary measures...|$|E
40|$|Development of many macrobenthic animals {{includes}} a planktonic larva {{which is often}} regarded as a classical means of dispersal. Nevertheless, many juvenile and adult benthic specimens have also been found drifting in the water column. They either actively left the sediment or were passively lifted off the sediment by currents or wave action. In the Sylt-Rømø Wadden Sea, traps sunk into the sediment were used to quantify drifting specimens as they re-entered the sediment. The goodness-of-fit {{between the number of}} drifting specimens and meteorological data achieved by iterative modelling was used as an indicator of the species-specific susceptibility to passive erosion. In bivalves the susceptibility to passive resuspension was independent from the species-specific activity in byssus-drifting. Obviously both modes of water column entry are independent from each other. Scoloplos armiger and Arenicola marina (both < 10 mm length) were exceptionally susceptible to sediment disturbance, but their susceptibility rapidly decreased as the specimens grew larger. In mud snails (Hydrobia ulvae), on the other hand, there was no indication for passive resuspension occurring at all. Thus, since species widely differ in their susceptibility to resuspension, any event of sediment disturbance may profoundly change community composition. This is exemplified in a shallow water offshore community. As a consequence, a sampling grid covering <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>km²</b> turned out to be unable to separate long-term temporal changes from spatial variability...|$|E
40|$|Flash flood is a {{very intense}} and quick hydrologic {{response}} of a catchment to rainfall. This phenomenon has a high spatial-temporal variability as the generating storm often hits small catchments (<b>few</b> <b>km²).</b> Given the small spatial temporal scales and high variability of flash floods, their prediction remains a hard exercise as the necessary data are often scarce. This study investigates the potential of hydrologic indices at different scales to improve understanding of flash floods dynamics and characterize catchment response in a model independent approach. These hydrologic indices gather information on hydrograph shape or catchment dynamic for instance and are useful to examine catchment signature in function of their size. Results show that for middle-size (> 100 km²) catchments response shape can be correlated to storm cell position within the catchment contrarily to smaller catchments. In a multi-scale point of view, regional characteristics about catchment geomorphology or rainfall field statistics should provide useful insight to find pertinent hydrologic response indices. The combined use of these indices with a physically-based distributed modelling could facilitate calibration on ungauged catchments...|$|R

40|$|Baseflow in the Andes is {{commonly}} {{considered to be}} related {{with the release of}} water stored in páramos. Páramo is the predominant ecosystem above 3500 m a. s. l. and is characterized by a rainy and cold climate with low evapotranspiration. However, this baseflow concept is based on hydrological process studies in small Andean catchments of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>km²</b> with a homogeneous land cover. Middle sized Andean catchments, like the sub-catchments of Tarqui and Yanuncay, Ecuador, are rarely homogeneous or uniformly covered by páramo. The objectives of this study are therefore to investigate baseflow characteristics in heterogeneous Andean catchments, and to identify relationships between baseflow processes and physical characteristics such as storage and recharge. Hereby, the contribution to baseflow of páramo and other sources such as alluvial aquifers is quantified. This study uses nonlinear recession analysis, physically based filters and digital filters for comparison of baseflow of neighbouring but distinct sub-catchments. The Yanuncay sub-catchment shows a clearly different storage capacity and recession. The storage capacity of Yanuncay is 50 % higher than for Tarqui due to its higher coverage of páramo. On the other hand, considerable storage capacity has also been found in the Tarqui sub-catchment, which has a limited páramo area but a significant alluvial aquifer. It is shown that improved understanding of the specific baseflow characteristics such as storage and recharge and its relationships to the heterogeneity of the land cover in Andean catchments will lead to a better assessment of the water resources and give new insights for effective management actions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} software PEGOPERA is a {{new tool}} resulting from the coupling of the PEGASE model (Planification Et Gestion de l’ASsainissement des Eaux, French acronym for planning and management of water purification) with a friendly Graphical User Interface. PEGASE is an integrated and physically based river/basin model and {{is devoted to the}} characterisation of the physico-chemical state of surface water, at the scale of a whole watershed or basin, including International River Basin District (IRBD). The aim of the model is to simulate non stationary scenarios at various scales (from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>km²</b> to hundreds of thousands km²) while handling the entire river tree (hundreds to thousands of water bodies). The purpose of PEGOPERA is to provide the stakeholders - as regards to surface water management - with a tool dedicated to the deterministic calculation of water quality of the rivers taking into account pollutant loads and discharges. In the context of the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC, the international coordination between neighbouring states and regions is required. The PEGOPERA software is adapted to simulate the IRBD Meuse. Indeed: i. 	An integrated transnational database relevant to the entire district is available; ii. 	The software is operational: the Meuse application has been calibrated and validated independently on most of regional sub-basins of the district; iii. 	The software could be used to simulate historical and future scenarios to assess water quality improvement that may be expected after applying basic and supplementary measures. The results demonstrate the relevance of the use of this software in this kind of transnational modelling. Some regions of the International District of the Meuse are validated on historical situations. Other parts still need to be improved in terms of consolidating the input databases. Prospective scenarios implementing measures from the WFD are carried out at this District scale. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Aquapôle of the University of Liège {{has been}} {{involved}} in environment modelling for more than 20 years. Its R&D unit focused on the domain of surface water, targeted to water quality. One of its environmental models, called PEGASE (Planification Et Gestion de l’ASsainissement des Eaux), French acronym for ―Planning and management of water purification‖ is devoted to the characterization of the environmental state of surface water, at the scale of a whole watershed, basin and district. The software has been used operationally in several countries like France and Benelux, but several calculations have also been performed at international level for the international commissions in charge of the Scheldt and the Meuse. PEGASE model requires as input, at least data like digital terrain models, water flow, water level and other hydrodynamic measurements in some geo-localized points, diffuse loads properties, ecological model data (to characterize bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes, shells, etc…), chemical discharges (from industry and cities) and treatment plant effect. The output of the software consists in tables, graphs and maps, showing the state of various calculated parameters of quality (DO, BOD, COD, N, P, Chla,… + indices) either at a specified time, along the river, or the temporal evolution at a given point. It provides printed maps or animations of the evolution of the results on the basin. The software is able to simulate non stationary scenarios from a local scale, up to a global scale i. e. <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>km²</b> to hundreds of thousands km² and handles the entire river tree (hundreds to thousands of water bodies). Some results of the model are already used to populate the SoE-Wise databases. On another hand, the model is a tool to validate and check consistency of SoE-Wise data at district (and thus international) level. The flexibility of the model enables to choose the time (daily to yearly periods) and spatial (watershed, water body, district, region, country …) scales of the expected results. PEGASE is also a full-scale operational tool for WFD implementation and WISE databases. This means that our partners handle a software (also known as the model) directly usable – and of direct help – in the implementation of the WFD and other water related directives. The model allows the member states to compare efficiently the collected international WISE data and populate database with relevant model results. We propose not only to read the data directly from the database to avoid manipulation mistakes, but also we propose to generate output data in a format directly exploitable by WISE databases administration.
