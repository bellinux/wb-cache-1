The cascade connection completely expresses {{the structure of the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>paths</b> from a sound source to microphones. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>paths</b> can thereby estimated with high precision. However, as well known, the recursive adaptive filter has two problems. One is that the performance of the recursive adaptive filter is apt to become unstable. We solve this problem by applying the lattice structure to the recursive adaptive filter. The stable performance is guaranteed by limiting the reflection coefficients to less than unity. Another is that the response of the recursive filter diverges when the minimum phase condition is not satisfied. We hence separate the recursive filter into the minimum and the non-minimum phase components. We next transform the latter into a non-recursive filter and connect it to the output of another microphone. The cascade connection can thereby steer the null with high stability and precision even in high reverberate non-minimum phase acoustic space...|$|R

It was suggested by Munk and Forbes (1989) that climate induced changes in ocean temperature may be monitored by measurements of cross-basin acoustic travel time variability. The feasibility {{of such a}} monitoring system depends on the spatial and temporal variability of the cross-basin <b>acoustic</b> <b>paths</b> {{in the presence of}} ocean variability of many different scales. For this thesis the variations in arrival position, azimuthal arrival angle, ray trajectory and the corresponding changes in travel times along the three- dimensional multipaths due to meso- and gyre scale ocean temperature fluctuations were analyzed. Emphasis was placed on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>paths</b> from Heard Island in the Indian Ocean, the proposed location for the sound source, to the west coast of the United States. An optimal receiver site location was found to exist in the vicinity of Monterey Bay, California. The possibility of a proposed listening site location near Coos Bay, Oregon, was also examined. However, the ray paths to Coos Bay interact with the bottom frequently, thus rendering them less reliable.

50|$|Long-{{baseline}} (LBL) systems, as {{in figure}} 1 above, use a sea-floor baseline transponder network. The transponders are typically {{mounted in the}} corners of the operations site. LBL systems yield very high accuracy of generally better than 1 m and sometimes as good as 0.01m along with very robust positions This {{is due to the fact}} that the transponders are installed in the reference frame of the work site itself (i.e. on the sea floor), the wide transponder spacing results in an ideal geometry for position computations, and the LBL system operates without an <b>acoustic</b> <b>path</b> to the (potentially distant) sea surface. Ultra-short-baseline (USBL) systems and the related super-short-baseline (SSBL) systems rely on a small (ex. 230 mm across), tightly integrated transducer array that is typically mounted on the bottom end of a strong, rigid transducer pole which is installed either on the side or in some cases on the bottom of a surface vessel. Unlike LBL and SBL systems, which determine position by measuring multiple distances, the USBL transducer array is used to measure the target distance from the transducer pole by using signal run time, and the target direction by measuring the phase shift of the reply signal as seen by the individual elements of the transducer array. The combination of distance and direction fixes the position of the tracked target relative to the surface vessel. Additional sensors including GPS, a gyro or electronic compass and a vertical reference unit are then used to compensate for the changing position and orientation (pitch, roll, bearing) of the surface vessel and its transducer pole. USBL systems offer the advantage of not requiring a sea floor transponder array. The disadvantage is that positioning accuracy and robustness is not as good as for LBL systems. The reason is that the fixed angle resolved by a USBL system translates to a larger position error at greater distance. Also, the multiple sensors needed for the USBL transducer pole position and orientation compensation each introduce additional errors. Finally, the non-uniformity of the underwater acoustic environment cause signal refractions and reflections that have a greater impact on USBL positioning than is the case for the LBL geometry.|$|E

The recorded travel time of these signals, about 13, 375 s, is a historical measure of the ocean temperature averaged across several ocean basins. The 1960 travel time measurement has about 3 -s precision. High-resolution global ocean state estimates for 2004 from the “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II” (ECCO 2) project were combined with ray tracing to determine the paths followed by the acoustic signals. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>paths</b> are refracted geodesics that are slightly deflected by either small-scale topographic features in the Southern Ocean or the coast of Brazil. The refractive influences of intense, small-scale oceanographic features, such as Agulhas Rings or eddies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, greatly reduce the necessary topographic deflection and cause the <b>acoustic</b> <b>paths</b> to meander in time. The ECCO 2 ocean state estimates, which are constrained by model dynamics and available data, were used to compute present-day travel times. Measured and computed arrival coda were in good agreement. Based on recent estimates of warming of the upper ocean, the travel-time change over the past half-century was nominally expected to be about − 9 s, but little difference between measured (1960) and computed (2004) travel times was found. Taking into account uncertainties in the 1960 measurements, the 2004 ocean state estimates, and other approximations, the ocean temperature averaged along the sound channel axis over the antipodal paths has warmed at a rate less than about 4. 6 m°Cyr− 1 (95 % confidence).
