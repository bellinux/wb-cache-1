One of the main sources of the pollutants is emissions from motor vehicles, which is originated from incomplete fuel combustion; either diesel or gasoline.

The data and results are obtained through engine experiments. Under lean conditions the ignition system faces harder conditions, in order to reliably ignite a lean fuel/air mixture an advanced ignition system is necessary. A literature study revealed that among, standard ignition, dual coil ignition, laser ignition, corona ignition and pre-chamber ignition the pre-chamber ignition system was capable of igniting the highest diluted mixture. The corona system however was second best and {{does not require a}} modification to the engine. The dual coil ignition system was installed on a multi-cylinder engine.

The filter removes soot particles, which are quasi-permanently burned using NO 2, which is produced from motor NO in the oxidation catalyst.

While these <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are incredibly effective at reducing harmful emissions, to operate effectively the system needs to be above a certain temperature level typically between 250 and 300 °C. Many methods such as additional fueling or electrical heaters have been explored and used to increase the temperature of the exhaust gases passing through these systems to heat them faster or maintain temperature. ^ The effect of cylinder deactivation, CDA, and late intake valve closing, LIVC, on raising exhaust gas temperatures was studied by performing load sweeps at 1200 RPM. The effect of CDA, CDA and LIVC, and CDA meeting specific NOx targets was analyzed. At low loads, CDA proved to be effective at raising exhaust temperature as well as providing an improvement in brake thermal efficiency, BTE. At higher loads, exhaust gas temperatures were also improved, but with a fuel consumption penalty. The introduction of LIVC in combination with CDA increased exhaust temperatures above 250 °C, but did not improve BTE. The last sweeps, which targeted low NOx emissions, required the use of EGR and were able to raise temperatures above 250 °C across all loads while meeting the targets. While meeting the targets, BTE was only improved at low loads. ^ The sweeps demonstrated that CDA and CDA combined with LIVC can be an extremely effective technology for raising exhaust gas temperatures even at low loads where exhaust temperatures are usually lowest. In many cases, an improvement in BTE can be accomplished as well. ...|$|R

All the automotive firms focused her efforts to reduce soot emissions by developing new <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> Common concepts for diesel exhaust <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> rely on Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC), Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and NOx absorbers. The most effective of these systems is the DPF, actually providing filtration rates better than 90 %. The geometry of the DPF structure has an important influence on its performance. Simulation offers a valuable tool for the evaluation and optimisation of various DPF designs. The present paper demonstrates the usage of the COMSOL multi physics code for modelling DPF systems. The complete model {{is based on a}} single pair of DPF channels composed of inlet / outlet channel, porous wall and the ash layer. Alternating plugs sealing the inlet- and outlet channels force the soot loaded exhaust gas to flow through the porous walls, where the soot is deposited into porous structure and at a growing soot cake layer. It is advantageous to separate the modelling of a DPF into several stages. In a first stage the pressure drop over the complete DPF channel structure unit cell is analysed in a CFD-analysis, also incorporating nonlinear pressure loss contributions due to flow contraction and expansion at the channel in and outlets. The pressure difference across the porous walls and the soot cake follows from Darcy's Law. In a next stage the soot deposition with its effect on the permeability of the porous walls and initiation of soot cake growth is included into the analysis. Phenomenological approximations on a continuum level are applied to account for the different microscopic and molecular processes of soot deposition within and at the surface of the porous wall structures. There is a strong both way interaction between gas flow field and soot deposition. The model results are compared to experimental measures of the DPF filter segments. A further level of model analysis is necessary to account for non-ideal effects of the measuring system...|$|R

This recovery has impacts on both the in cylinder fuel conversion efficiency and the efficiency of the after treatment. Results of engine performance simulations are performed for a in-line four cylinder 1. 6 litres LPG CI passenger car engine with a power turbine following the turbine of the turbocharger or an heat exchanger to recover the exhaust (and other) waste heat and compared with the experimental results for the diesel without waste heat recover...|$|E
40|$|Exhaust gas {{emissions}} from ships are increasingly polluting the air environment seriously. Therefore, the MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex VI is applied for all ships from 2017, Annex VI {{provided that the}} concentrations of NOx,SOx CO contained in ship’s exhaust gases must be less than 6. 4 g/kWh, 0. 6 g/kWh, and 5. 5 g/kWh respectively. Today, {{there are many solutions}} to reduce pollution emissions from exhaust gas of ships, such as improving combustion, using oil emulsion, using biofuel,…However, these solutions also have a handful of disadventages such as being unable to thoroughly resoulve problems, high cost, and very difficult {{to improve the quality of}} ship exhaust {{gas emissions}} for old ships. Exhaust gas treatment method uses a centralized <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> where exhaust gas from the thermal engines is taken in a centralized <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> before discharging into the air. <b>After</b> centralized <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> in comparision with raw exhaust gas, soot can be reduced by 98 %, NOx can be reduced by 75 %, SOx can be reduced by 80 %. This method of treatment is not only low cost, good quality but also make marine heat-engines still use traditional fuels as well as need not improve its structure...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the molecular mechanisms of Bifidobacterium infantis thymidine kinase/nucleoside analogue ganciclovir (BI-TK/GCV) <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> which was proven to exhibit sustainable anti-tumor growth activity and induce apoptosis in bladder cancer, a proteomic approach of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. 192 down-regulated and 210 up-regulated proteins were identified <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> with BI-TK/GCV <b>system</b> in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that Peroxiredoxin-I (Prx-I) was significantly down-regulated in bladder cancer <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> Prx-I silencing by transfection of Prx-I shRNA significantly suppressed growth, promoted apoptosis and regulated the cell cycle in T 24 cells and reduced the phospho-NF-kB p 50 and p 65 protein expression which revealed the links between Prx-I and NF-kB pathway implied by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). These findings yield new insights into the therapy of bladder cancer, revealing Prx-I as a new therapeutic target and indicating BI-TK/GCV system as a prospective therapy by down-regulation of Prx-I through NF-kB signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuels {{produces}} NOx emissions which is {{the main cause of}} acid rain formation, photochemical smog and depletion of the ozone layer. More than 95 % of NOx emissions are derived from two sources, 49 % from mobile (vehicles) and 46 % from stationary (power plants). <b>After</b> <b>treatment</b> exhaust <b>systems</b> uses catalytic technology for control and elimination of NOx where a number of principles and material groups are applied. The future combustion engines must work under lean conditions {{in order to reduce the}} fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. Suitable materials with long term stability are required for effective catalytic NOx reduction. In the present work we present the synthesis and characterization of Pd substituted perovskite catalyst. This material shows particularly good catalytic activity and displays a reversible redox behavior leading to excellent stability at high temperature...|$|R
