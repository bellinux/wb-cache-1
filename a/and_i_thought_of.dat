500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
