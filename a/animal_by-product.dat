This is due to its potential to combat protein malnutrition and food insecurity in many countries. Shortly after slaughter, <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> are separated into edible or inedible parts. The edible part accounts for 55 % of the production while the remaining part is regarded as inedible by-products (IEBPs). These IEBPs can be re-processed into sustainable products for agricultural and industrial uses. The efficient utilization of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> can alleviate the prevailing cost and scarcity of feed materials, which have high competition between animals and humans.

We first offer a chemical and physical description of {{the various types of}} <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and derived products not intended for humans with a view to their possible use as fuels. <b>Animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and derived products not intended for humans have an extremely high viscosity for the pressure pulverisation burners used in residential oil burning equipment. We therefore mixed diesel with <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and other derived products not intended for humans in different percentages so as to obtain suitable viscosity. To achieve this, we carried out a study of the miscibility of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> in diesel. We subsequently performed a series of combustion experiments for mixtures of diesel and <b>animal</b> <b>by-products,</b> in varying (a) percentage of by-products in diesel, (b) injection pressure and (c) excess air in combustion. We analysed the experimental combustion results based on (a) energy efficiency of combustion, (b) CO and NO x [...] emissions and (c) fossil-based greenhouse effect gases. Finally, we present the conclusions that combustion of mixed diesel with <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and other derived products not intended for humans for use as boiler fuel low power does not require specific technology when using a conventional fuel oil burner for proper combustion. One only needs to adjust the burner factors: pressure and air flow. In the study of the combustion of mixtures, once the burner factor is adjusted, it appears that the combustion efficiency and greenhouse gas and emission gases are acceptable. The costs of removing fat through incineration or landfill range from 34 to 59 €/ton. The solution proposed in this work not only avoided the cost but also mentioned the value of residue use as fuel.|$|R

40|$|Hypertension or {{high blood}} {{pressure}} is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which are {{the leading cause of}} death in the Western world. Next to lifestyle modifications, including smoke cessation, exercise, stress management and a healthy diet, functional foods containing angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory peptides can play a role in the prevention of hypertension. ACE (EC 3. 4. 15. 1) plays a key role in different blood pressure-regulating mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron-system (RAAS) and the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS), where its action results in an overall increase in blood pressure. Thus, peptides or protein hydrolysates with ACE-inhibitory activity have a blood pressure-lowering effect. In this project, the potential of different protein hydrolysates for the development of an antihypertensive functional food was investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{digestibility}} of <b>animal</b> <b>by-product</b> protein {{was measured}} using a direct color-imetric assay of protein in feed and excreta samples.

Digestibility of meat and bone meal protein by this method ranged between 70. 3 and 96. 0 %. The digestibility of feather meals ranged between 79. 0 and 86. 1 %.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of the <b>animal</b> <b>by-product</b> {{meat and}} bone meal (MBM) {{has been investigated}} {{in order to assess}} how it is affected structurally and chemically by incineration. Initially composed of intergrown collagen and hydroxyapatite (HAP), combustion of the organic component is complete by 650 °C, with most mass loss (50 – 55 %) occurring by 500 °C. No original proteins were detected in samples heated at 400 °C or above. Combustion of collagen is accompanied by an increase in HAP mean crystallite size at temperatures greater than 400 °C, from 10 nm to a constant value of 120 nm at 800 °C or more. Newly formed crystalline phases appear beyond 400 °C, and include β-tricalcium phosphate, NaCaPO 4, halite (NaCl) and sylvite (KCl). Crystallite thickness as judged by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) increases from 2 nm (25 – 400 °C) to 8 – 9 nm very rapidly at 550 °C, and then gradually increases to approximately 10 nm.
