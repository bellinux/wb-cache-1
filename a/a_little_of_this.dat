500|$|The bootlegged {{recording}} {{starts with}} engineer Geoff Emerick announcing the remix as [...] "RM1 of Take..." [...] and then momentarily forgetting the take number, which Lennon jokingly finishes with [...] "Take your knickers off and let's go", {{hence the name}} of the bootleg CD. The first half of the recording is almost identical to the released track [...] "Revolution 1". It lacks the electric guitar and horn overdubs of the final version, but features two tape loops in the key of A (same as the song) that are faded in and out at various points. After the final chorus, the song launches into an extended coda similar to that in [...] "Hey Jude". (The album version only features about 40 seconds of this coda.) Beyond the point where the album version fades out, the basic instrumental backing keeps repeating while the vocals and overdubs become increasingly chaotic: Harrison and Paul McCartney repeatedly sing [...] "dada, mama" [...] in a childlike register; Lennon's histrionic vocals are randomly distorted in speed (<b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> can be heard in the fade of [...] "Revolution 1"); and radio tuning noises à la [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] appear. Several elements of this coda appear in the officially released [...] "Revolution 9". Throughout the body of that song, Lennon's histrionic vocal track periodically appears (albeit minus the speed distortion), as do the tape loops.|$|E
