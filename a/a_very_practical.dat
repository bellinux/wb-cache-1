25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>practical</b> alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E

He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father.

Accordingly, group means on the VESAS were used to examine differences between women STEM switchers and women STEM persisters. The analyses revealed statistically significant differences in means between women STEM persisters (M =  34.81, SD =  4.52) and women STEM switchers (M =  29.64, SD =  4.27) on the perceived value of STEM fields subscale. Cohens’ 4 (1988) effect size value suggested <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large <b>practical</b> significance (d =  1.55). Similarly, we found statistically significant differences in means between women STEM persisters (M =  29.64, SD =  4.27) and women STEM switchers (M =  25.02, SD =  4.94) on the expectations for success in STEM careers subscale. Cohen’s effect size value suggested <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large <b>practical</b> significance (Cohen d =  1.00).
