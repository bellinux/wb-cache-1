5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have liked to have publicized their enemy's own <b>alleged</b> <b>violation</b> of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E

In response, the institute argued they have “a long-standing commitment to treating animals humanely and with the highest regard for their well-being, and…continuously seek to enhance the care provided to” the animals in their facility. Between 2012-2015, the institute has been cited by federal inspectors for at least 16 <b>alleged</b> <b>violations</b> of the Animal Welfare Act. In 2012, the institute was fined $25,714 for <b>alleged</b> <b>violations</b> and two years prior, it paid a $6,094 settlement to the government for additional <b>alleged</b> <b>violations.</b> The institute says the <b>alleged</b> <b>violations</b> {{are a result of}} isolated incidents and are not reflective of their treatment of the monkeys in their laboratories.|$|R

25|$|Minor was cooptated to the {{governing}} Central Executive Committee of the CPA on April 24, 1922, by {{decision of the}} CEC itself. He was re-elected {{in his own right}} at the ill-fated August 1922 convention held on the shores of Lake Michigan just outside the tiny Michigan town of Bridgman. This convention was raided by local and Michigan state authorities, acting in concert with the Bureau of Investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice, who had an undercover agent sitting as a delegate. Wanted by the police, Minor surrendered with 9 others on March 10, 1923, and was released shortly thereafter on $1,000 bond. He was never tried for this <b>alleged</b> <b>violation</b> of the Michigan criminal syndicalism law.|$|E

The military activity of Russia in Syria has been criticized by the U.S. and its regional allies; Turkey overtly clashed with the Russian military in November 2015 over the <b>alleged</b> <b>violation</b> of its airspace by a Russian plane as well as over Russia′s bombardment of the areas held by anti-government forces that are supported by Turkey, especially in the Bayırbucak region.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{and control}} of {{potential}} accidents that may derail the peace process {{can be achieved by}} the peacekeeping force by deterring rogue groups. Belligerent forces are often undisciplined without a strong central source of command and control, therefore while a peace is being negotiated there is potential for a rogue group on one side to renege and spoil the peace process. UN forces can serve to prevent this. Additionally, the UN force can serve as a moderator and make communication easy between both parties and bring in political moderates from either side. By providing law and order UN peacekeeping forces can temporarily replace a state’s security forces and prevent a bias overreaction to an <b>alleged</b> <b>violation</b> by one side which could in turn result in escalation and a renewal in the violence.|$|E

25|$|Young v. Facebook, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 2d 1110, is a pro se {{internet}} law case {{in which}} the plaintiff sued the social network Facebook following the termination of her user account. In her original complaint, the plaintiff, Karen Beth Young, <b>alleged</b> <b>violation</b> of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and fraud. In the U.S. District Court of Northern California, Facebook moved to dismiss the claim, and on October 25, 2010, presiding Judge Jeremy Fogel granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Redirecting her complaint, Young alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws on disability, as well as breach of contract and negligence. Again, Facebook moved to dismiss, and Judge Fogel dismissed the case without leave to amend.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 1915, Minor {{moved to}} the New York Call, a Socialist Party-affiliated daily broadsheet.

Minor's radical cartoons would later provide fodder for the United States government's prosecution of The Masses for <b>alleged</b> <b>violation</b> of the Espionage Act of 1917, a legal assault which would eventually lead {{to the demise of}} the magazine. Minor was sent as a war correspondent of The Call to Europe, where he wrote from France and Italy. Part of Minor's European expenses were being borne by a liberal newspaper syndicate in exchange for use of his drawings from the front. The syndicate found themselves unable to use the radical material which Minor was by this time producing and The Call was forced to recall him from Europe.|$|E
25|$|Violations of {{conditions}} of probation or supervised release {{can result in}} said revocations being reported to the court and a revocation hearing being held. In such hearings, the defendant {{has the right to}} be informed of the <b>alleged</b> <b>violation,</b> to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed, and to have a probable cause hearing. The defendant has the burden of establishing that if released pending further proceedings, they will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community. The law mandates revocation for some violations, such as possession of a controlled substance, possession of a firearm, or refusal to take a drug test. The statute specifies the possible consequences of revocation, and the sentencing guidelines establish grades of violations and a revocation table recommending various terms of imprisonment depending on the seriousness of the violation and the defendant's criminal history when he/she was originally sentenced.|$|E

40|$|In 2007, the {{collapse}} of the housing market and the developing trend of state court filings of class actions <b>alleging</b> <b>violations</b> of the Securities Act culminated into a new type of securities litigation: state court filings of class actions <b>alleging</b> <b>violations</b> of the Securities Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities in general and mortgage-backed securities in particular. Thus, it became important for defendants to remove these claims to federal court. Permitting removal of such claims appears to conflict with the Securities Act, which broadly prohibits removal of claims arising under the Securities Act. But prohibiting removal is in tension with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which generally permits removal of class actions. This article considers whether the Securities Act bars removal of class actions <b>alleging</b> <b>violations</b> of the Securities Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Part I of this article provides a background on the issue and explains the general framework of removal and the conflicting provisions of the Securities Act and the Class Action Fairness Act. Next, Part II discusses the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Luther v. Countrywide that the Securities Act bars removal of a class action <b>alleging</b> <b>violations</b> of the Securities Act with respect to mortgage-backed securities. Part III analyzes the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Katz v. Gerardi, in which the court disagreed with Luther and held that the Securities Act does not bar removal of class actions that <b>allege</b> <b>violations</b> of the Securities Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Finally, Part IV analyzes and expands on the reasoning of the Luther and Katz courts, concluding that the Seventh Circuit decided correctly that the Securities Act does not bar removal of class actions <b>alleging</b> <b>violations</b> of the Securities Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities...|$|R
