60|$|Dorinda winked {{her eyes}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{when she was}} doubtful.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{dismissed}} {{the subject as}} abruptly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when the conversation touched too nearly on the sensitive edge of her soul dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. Spencer {{promises}} {{it before}} Hector's holidays are over," [...] said Margaret, blushing, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> with pleasure, when they talked of the church.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then she'll 'draw' {{of course}} immensely, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> But her sister won't {{be in that}} case with her," [...] the young man supposed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} premiered on 21 May 2010 on Professor Green's {{official}} YouTube account. He commented, [...] "Lily is wicked. <b>She's</b> looking iconic, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does....</b> And there are girls everywhere {{who are not}} wearing much. Girls is the theme. There is also a conveyor belt which was nicked from The Price is Right set next door. The video has been great fun." ...|$|R
50|$|The book {{begins when}} Luterin has just {{recovered}} from a mysterious illness (not the Fat Death) that kept him immobile {{for about a year}} after the unexplained suicide of his elder brother Favin, whose name it is now forbidden to speak. His father and his neighbour arranged {{a long time ago that}} Luterin would one day marry the neighbour's daughter Insil Esikananzi, thereby forging a closer tie between their two prominent families. Luterin goes to visit Insil but <b>she</b> confuses him <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> and gives him the feeling that she disapproves of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I meet Myra Murray again," [...] said Anne, [...] "I {{want to see}} {{her coming}} towards me, brisk and laughing, just <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> here." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{his poor}} wife gave up arguing, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and long before dawn on the {{following}} morning, Mr. Dove, accompanied by two guides, departed upon his errand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Ailie, {{looking very}} grave and earnest, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when our Maker's name {{happened}} to be mentioned. [...] "Does God work miracles still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{know just}} what it is, darling,' cried the girl, putting her arm around her mother's waist caressingly, and drawing her down to kiss her face {{half a dozen times}} over in her {{outburst}} of sympathy. 'That horrid old Miss Catherine has been here again, I'm sure, for I saw her going out of the shop just now, and she's been saying something or other spiteful, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> to vex my dearie. What did she say to you to-day, now do tell us, duckie mother?' ...|$|R
60|$|Why couldn't her son go {{straight}} for his ends, clear tangible ends, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>done?</b> This thinking about everything! She {{had never thought}} about anything in all her life {{for more than half}} an hour--and it had always turned out remarkably well.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really think}} that she does. When I was obliged to make some allusion to it--at least I felt myself obliged, and was very sorry {{afterwards}} that I did--she merely laughed--a great loud laugh <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> {{and then went on}} about the business. However, she was clear about this, that all the expenses of the election should be added to the sum to be advanced by her, and that the house should be left to you without any rent. If you choose to take the land round the house you must pay for it, by the acre, as the tenants do. <b>She</b> was <b>as</b> clear about it all <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> had passed her life in a lawyer's office." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid he'll {{laugh at}} our paper, and {{make fun of}} us afterward," [...] {{observed}} Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when doubtful.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, {{and giving}} no other sign of vitality, looked (<b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did)</b> like an indifferently {{executed}} transparency {{of a small}} female figure, without enough light behind it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} go to her!" [...] Mysa repeated. [...] "She thought of herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and not of me in any way. You know it was so, Chebron--you cannot deny it!" ...|$|E
50|$|At the Purleys', it {{is evident}} that severe {{tensions}} exist between Roxanne and her mother. Both are frustrated with one another and getting on one another's nerves. Maurice and Monica also experience domestic tensions. Monica comes across as abrupt, but later scenes reveal that she suffers from severe menstrual cramps and Monica makes concerted efforts to placate matters and be contrite. Things are also not well between Maurice and his sister, they are a bit awkward with one another but both look forward to celebrating Roxanne's birthday. Cynthia refers to Maurice affectionately as her little brother and asks him <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> when he is going to shave. It is clear that Cynthia somehow can survive by the money she receives from Maurice.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{laughed at}} Jerome <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>done,</b> {{and would not}} have owned for the world that she could have missed him. Jerome was useful, she admitted, and a {{comfortable}} friend; and she would have liked him well enough if he would only omit that ridiculous yearly ceremony of proposal.|$|R
50|$|Later, Danny {{is given}} advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature {{with a sweet}} one <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does)</b> through song on how to {{interest}} and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth, the head of Mammoth Studios; and Flanagan, the film's director, are giving an interview, gets the animals blamed for the damage, and gets them fired. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny who was convinced by Darla that {{she was trying to}} help the animals). As Woolie tells Danny to leave for home, Tillie suggests Sawyer to follow Danny.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{other girls}} {{went to their}} rooms as agreed upon, and all was soon dark and still up stairs, while Miss Cotton began to enjoy herself below, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when 'her young charges' were safely {{disposed}} of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, aunt; but pray do not. I don't wish it." [...] Miss Baker {{of course}} obeyed, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> And so George sat there, talking about {{anything}} or nothing, rather lack-a-daisically, till {{he got up}} to take his leave.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} {{came into her}} papa's study, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> Saturday morning before breakfast, {{and asked for a}} story. He tried to beg off that morning, for he was very busy, but she would not let him. So he began: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{sat back}} and screwed her eyes tight, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>done</b> when puzzled. Something had {{happened}} to her, but how it had happened and when it had happened and why it had happened she could not understand. She only knew that {{now for the first}} time she had been granted a moment of clear vision and was seeing things truly.|$|R
60|$|The queen {{must have}} taken special pains with this her first letter to her son, for, with all its faults of orthography, {{it is very much}} more correct than most of the epistles which she {{attempted}} to write in English. She was very imperfectly acquainted with the English language, using, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> almost <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> in her domestic intercourse, her own native tongue.|$|R
5000|$|On July 5 in 1902, {{exactly a}} hundred years ago, at 3pm whilst [...] Assunta and the other {{children}} were at the threshing floor, Serenelli who persistently sought sexual favours from the [...] girl approached her. She {{was taking care of}} her infant sister in the farmhouse. [...] threatened her with a 10 inch dagger, and when <b>she</b> refused, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>done,</b> he stabbed her 14 times.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{young man}} is the most {{conceited}} puppy it was ever my misfortune to meet," [...] said Sir Peregrine to Mrs. Orme, {{when she came to}} kiss him and take his blessing <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> before leaving him for the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Up betimes, Rachel," [...] she said, {{smiling and}} {{speaking}} me fair, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and hating {{me in her}} heart, as I well knew. [...] "That is right, for we'll have plenty to do to-day. A wedding makes lots of work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Miss;" [...] Eve recoiled, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> when Mr. Bragg {{used this}} vulgar and contemptuous mode of address; [...] "we put no body up or down; all we aim it is a just equality--to place all, {{as near as}} possible, on a level." ...|$|E
50|$|Now in Rick's custody, the {{officers}} insist Dawn won't trade for them, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> doesn't like them anyway, but if released vow to oust Lerner and install Lamson in her place. Lamson, however, advises Rick that Lerner will start from a no-negotiating position but will compromise <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> and ultimately make the trade. Meanwhile, Sasha is still distraught over Bob's death, and her interest is piqued when she discovers that Lamson's first name is also Bob. When Rick, Tyreese, and Daryl leave {{to make contact}} with Dawn, Sasha is left alone with the prisoners and Lamson tells her a heart-rending story how his partner, who was killed in the bombings, has come back as a walker, but he {{never had a chance to}} put him out of his misery. Sasha offers to help Lamson put his partner to rest (and get her own closure) and Lamson guides her to a location from which she can shoot. However, when she takes aim Lamson tackles Sasha and knocks her out, fleeing.|$|R
6000|$|... "After a time," [...] {{continued}} Grandfather Frog, [...] "there {{began to}} be more land and still more. Then some of the animals began {{to spend most of}} their time on the land. As there got to be more and more land, more and more of the animals left the water, until finally most of them were spending nearly all of the time on land. Now Old Mother Nature had been keeping a sharp watch, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> and when <b>she</b> found that they were foolish enough to like the land best, she did all that she could to make things comfortable for them. She taught them how to run and jump and climb and dig, according to which things they liked best to do, so that it wasn't very long before a lot of them forgot that they ever had lived in the water, and they began to look down on those who still lived in the water, and to put on airs and hold their heads very high.|$|R
50|$|Eugenides, the one-handed former Thief of Eddis, has {{married the}} Queen of Attolia, {{bringing}} {{peace to the}} two countries and becoming King. But {{what kind of a}} king is he? Slouching on his throne, he appears to sleep during important briefings, makes snide remarks, wears ridiculous clothes, and refuses {{to be more than a}} figurehead, letting the Queen rule <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has <b>always</b> <b>done.</b> The Attolian court resents him as a foreigner, an upstart, and an ineffectual fool.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what do you}} think, my dear?" [...] Miss Crawley said to {{the young}} lady, for whom she had taken a liking at first sight, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> for pretty and modest young people; though it must be owned her {{affections}} cooled as rapidly as they rose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot hush. Just because Margaret fancies robbers and murderers, and {{all sorts}} of nonsense, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> is poor Harry to be accused of wantonly terrifying her, and shut up, and cut off from Confirmation? and just when he is going away, too! It is unkind, and unjust, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|Helena laughed swiftly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when {{he became}} {{whimsical}} and fretful. He sat with his head bent down, smiling with his lips, but his eyes melancholy. She put her hand out to him. He took it without apparently observing it, folding his own hand over it, and unconsciously increasing the pressure.|$|E
50|$|Her second son, Kaka is also towing {{the music}} line. He is a hip hop artiste and producer. One of her {{earliest}} albums 'Ever Liked my Person' sold above platinum till date. So popular {{was one of}} its hit songs 'Seun Rere', {{that a number of}} African countries have sung their own version. The singer intended to spend the day with the less-privileged children <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has <b>always</b> <b>done</b> over the years.Essien-Igbokwe died on 30 June 2011 after a brief illness.|$|R
60|$|Warner was in New York. I wrote him, {{and he said}} {{he would}} fetch up Ward--which he did. Yesterday they went to the Gerhardts and spent two hours, and Ward came away bewitched with those people and marveling at the winning innocence of the young wife, who dropped {{naturally}} into model-attitude beside the statue (which is stark naked from head to heel, now--G. had removed the drapery, fearing Ward would think he was afraid to try legs and hips) just <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has <b>always</b> <b>done</b> before.|$|R
40|$|In {{the popular}} romantic comedy Sleepless in Seattle (Ephron, 1993), a pivotal {{scene in the}} middle of the film sums up the crux of the dilemma faced by Annie (Meg Ryan), the female protagonist. She is having {{difficulty}} making an important decision about her love life and, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> turns to the classic film An Affair to Remember (McCarey, 1957) for guidance. As she watches the film with her best friend Becky (Rosie O’Donnell), she says, “Now those were the days when people knew how to be in love, time, distance, nothing could separate them because they knew. ” In response, Becky observes, “That’s your problem, you don’t want to be in love, you want to be in love in a movie. ” This interaction between Annie and Becky is meant to elicit a sense of recognition among Sleepless in Seattle’s audience because the text assumes that by nature of the fact that they are watching the film, its spectators must empathize with, if not share, Annie’s desire to fall in love in a way that is completely removed from the mundane realities of everyday life. However, the text also assumes that the audience will find equally familiar Becky’s pointed critique of Annie’s misguided preoccupation...|$|R
