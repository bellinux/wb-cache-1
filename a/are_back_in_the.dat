500|$|The video {{begins in}} a room with a man named Fuzz (Polow da Don) telling B.B. (Hilson) and her gun-slinging women crew {{consisting}} of Boots (JoJo), Danja (Evans), and Money (Dawn Richard) about bringing in Hilson's boyfriend into custody. After Hilson assures Jammal that she can handle it, the song begins and Hilson are seen wearing outfits of black bikinis as they dance seductively to the song's chorus and verse. Meanwhile, Hilson and her crew <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room preparing themselves with scenes of Hilson grinding against a large vault door. As the song moves to the pre-chorus, Hilson and her crew are shown at a party, mingling with the male guests and handing them drinks. As Ross' verse begins, he, Short and da Don are shown at the party as Hilson's crew grind themselves around them and Hilson kisses Short's head. The song pauses and Hilson and her crew move into a room with Polow da Don, Short, and Ross sitting in chair with other men in the background. Unexpectedly, her crew all pull out their guns. Short (who {{has turned out to be}} Hilson's target) is able to respond almost immediately by having his men pull out their guns. Seeing they are evenly matched, Short agrees to let Hilson take him into custody, with Hilson removing her top and locking them both in handcuffs. The two walk upstairs, where Short pushes Hilson against the wall and they kiss on the stairway. The video ends with Short following Hilson upstairs while the words [...] "To be continued..."

2500|$|All Saints <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> groove. [...] All Saints did a {{good job}} {{showcasing}} some strong new material. [...] Forthcoming single 'Rock Steady' was another energetic, commercially viable highlight. They looked tired at times, especially Mel Blatt, who perspired heavily under the lights, and while their routines were competent, serious questions have to be asked about their live skills, with accusations of miming rumbling frequently around the room. Luckily for All Saints, this didn't feel like a symptom of decline, having always employed minimal physical effort, simple choreography, and heavily produced vocals. All Saints are not natural live performers, but against the odds, last night's showing provided some optimism about their comeback potential.|$|E

Standing alone under the great trees in the dark still nights, the sound seems to increase the feeling of loneliness, to make the gloom deeper, the silence more profound. Turning our visions inward on such occasions, we are startled with a glimpse of the night-side of nature in the soul: we have with us strange unexpected guests, fantastic beings that are in no way related to our lives; dead and buried since childhood, they have miraculously been restored to life.
