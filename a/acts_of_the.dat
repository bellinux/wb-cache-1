It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E

5|$|With {{this new}} power he persuaded the chamber {{to pass the}} radical Ventôse Decrees, under which the régime would {{confiscate}} aristocratic émigré property and distribute it to needy sans-culottes.

The Committee faltered in creating procedures for their enforcement, and the frantic pace of unfolding political events left them behind.|$|E

5|$|At age 13, Clayton {{entered the}} private St Columba's College {{secondary}} school in Rathfarnham, Dublin. Here he {{made friends with}} other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop/rock music <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, including The Who, The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, and Carole King. In response he bought a £5 acoustic guitar from a junk-shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs. John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba's, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the bass guitar for the first time. His mother purchased a bass {{for him when he}} was 14 years old {{on the basis of a}} given promise that he would commit himself to learn to play the instrument.|$|E
5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apostles.|$|E
5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Parliament.|$|E

In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 Planché was to {{collaborate}} on an opera with another notable composer, Felix Mendelssohn.

But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed doubts about the subject, asked Planché to start work on a completely new libretto, and eventually stopped replying to Planché's letters.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, {{began to take}} their places as the dominant styles in the mainstream, which resulted in heavy metal music losing popularity and going underground for a decade.

Audiences in many underground metal scenes began favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular styles. As with other glam metal <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, Stryper lost popularity and split up in 1993.|$|E
