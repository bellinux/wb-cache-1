Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them.

25|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether {{the release of the}} 15 British naval {{personnel}} had any coincidence with the release of a senior Iranian diplomat, Jalal Sharafi, who was taken hostage during a kidnapping in 2007. He was released on Tuesday, 3 April 2007, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> into the Iranian embassy in Baghdad, although it is not clear who had abducted him. He was taken captive by a group of men dressed in uniforms of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion – a special Iraqi unit under US direction. After his release, Sharafi claimed he had been kidnapped and tortured by American troops and agents of an Iraqi organisation acting {{under the supervision of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency. Signs of torture were reportedly found on Sharafi's body for which he received medical treatment. Iran also allegedly now has access to five Iranian nationals arrested in the US raid on Iranian liaison office in Arbil. An International Committee of the Red Cross team also visited the Iranian detainees. The British government however repeatedly stated that it made no deals with the United States or with Iran to secure the release of the detainees, and the timing of these events may be purely coincidental.|$|E

The opening partnership had reached 117 before Hollies removed Barnes for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00. As Bradman had announced that the tour {{would be his last}} at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. With 6,996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100.00 in Test cricket.

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted {{much more}} fluently as the {{overcast}} skies cleared {{and the sun}} came out. Australia had reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The score had reached 117 before Barnes was removed by Hollies for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket. [...] Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies from the back foot. Hollies pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the batsman leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause.

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder {{and did not}} bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an hour}} to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying [...] "to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit." ...|$|E

However, in their WrestleMania V match against the Brain Busters (Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson), Martel turned on Santana during the match after accidentally {{being hit by}} Santana's Flying forearm smash. Martel refused to tag in <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the dressing room leaving Santana to face both opponents alone (the Busters then easily defeated Tito with a Spike piledriver). In an interview with [...] "Mean" [...] Gene Okerlund immediately following the match, Martel called Santana a loser {{and said he was}} sick and tired of carrying him. His feud with the newly heel Martel would last throughout 1989, with both men on opposing teams at both SummerSlam and Survivor Series and Santana defeating Martel in the finals of the 1989 King of the Ring tournament. Tito even allied with his former archenemies Demolition against Martel, defeating him and The Fabulous Rougeaus in a six-man tag match on June 22, 1989 in Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{perpetrators}} returned, both [...] "walking with a swagger" [...] {{to where}} McIlwaine waited downhill from the parked car with Burcombe. McIlwaine {{at that moment}} made an attempt to run away but Brown, Dillon, and Burcombe {{caught up with him}} as he fell to the ground. Brown gave him a severe kicking, mostly in the head. Dillon produced a butcher's knife and cut McIlwaine's throat while Brown shouted encouragement and Burcombe overlooked the scene from about five feet away. Brown and Dillon left McIlwaine still breathing on the ground; once they were back inside the car, Brown proposed to drive the car over his head, but Dillon dissuaded him. Brown halted the vehicle, took the knife <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> over to where McIlwaine was lying on the road making a [...] "wheezing" [...] sound. Brown stabbed McIlwaine repeatedly in the face and chest.

According to Burcombe's later testimony, Brown appeared [...] "crazed" [...] as he handed the knife back to Dillon and said he was [...] "buzzing"; he subsequently went on to recount stabbing McIlwaine in the eye. He threatened to cut Burcombe's throat or kill a member of his family if he told anyone what happened.|$|E

2500|$|On October 12, Valdez called Trinidad Espinoza to the stand. He {{testified that}} he saw Saldívar {{pointing}} a gun while running after Selena.

After hearing this testimony, Marcella Quintanilla (Selena's mother) experienced chest and arm pains and was hospitalized to treat a sudden rise in her blood pressure. Motel maid Norma Marie Martinez also described the same events as Espinoza, but added that Saldívar had called Selena a [...] "bitch". Tinker asked Martinez to indicate {{where she had been}} on a diagram of the scene of the crime. He believed that Martinez could not have seen or heard anything because she was a considerable distance from the vicinity of the shooting. Emergency room personnel, who attended to Saldívar when Selena drove her to the hospital to be checked for rape, claimed that Saldívar had lied to Selena about the rape as there were inconsistencies between the story she told them and the one she told Selena. Tinker asked the nurse to describe Saldívar's mood at that time. She replied that the Saldívar showed symptoms of depression. Tinker asked if those symptoms were typically found in a victim of sexual assault. The nurse agreed they were. Another nurse who attended to Saldívar stated that she had red welts on her neck and arms, but that they did not resemble the bruises a person would receive from an assault by a baseball bat as Saldívar claimed.|$|E
