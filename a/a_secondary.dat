25|$|<b>A</b> spherical <b>secondary</b> {{can achieve}} higher {{implosion}} densities than <b>a</b> cylindrical <b>secondary,</b> because spherical implosion pushes {{in from all}} directions toward the same spot. However, in warheads yielding more than one megaton, the diameter of <b>a</b> spherical <b>secondary</b> would be too large for most applications. <b>A</b> cylindrical <b>secondary</b> is necessary in such cases. The small, cone-shaped re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields {{of a few hundred}} kilotons.|$|R

5|$|Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; {{the royal}} hypogeum {{provided}} {{a large amount}} of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it.

The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during <b>a</b> <b>secondary</b> burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E
