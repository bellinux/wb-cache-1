5|$|Almost all the {{necessary}} corrections of misspellings have been made. Sometimes a stroke of the pen indicates an error, perhaps to be corrected later. Some corrections seem to be written by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The <b>apostrophe</b> is used even when not required, especially in εξ', and ουκ'.|$|E

It rarely featured on early Underground maps, but has been consistently used on them since 1951. Kings X, Kings + and London KX are abbreviations used in space-limited contexts. The National Rail station code is KGX.|$|E

5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of.

Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an <b>apostrophe.</b>|$|E

After running the show in 1939, Mrs Cruft sold the show to The Kennel Club, however due to World War II, it wasn't until 1948 when they ran the show for the first time. The show would remain being called Cruft's until 1974, when during a rebrand the <b>apostrophe</b> was dropped, resulting in the show being called Crufts, which it continues to be called at the present.|$|E

25|$|Some older {{locations}} retain signage {{with the}} company's name including a possessive <b>apostrophe,</b> {{despite the fact}} that the official styling of the company's name has been Tim Hortons, without an <b>apostrophe,</b> for at least a decade. The company had removed the <b>apostrophe</b> after signs using the <b>apostrophe</b> were interpreted by some to be breaking the language sign laws of the Province of Quebec in 1993. The removal of the <b>apostrophe</b> allowed the company to have one common sign image across Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{form of the}} <b>apostrophe</b> {{originates}} in manuscript writing, as a point with a downwards tail curving clockwise. This form was inherited by the typographic <b>apostrophe</b> (’), {{also known as the}} typeset <b>apostrophe,</b> or, informally, the curly <b>apostrophe.</b> Later sans-serif typefaces had stylised apostrophes with a more geometric or simplified form, but usually retaining the same directional bias as a closing quotation mark.|$|E
25|$|Since 1951, {{the station}} {{name has been}} spelt with an <b>apostrophe</b> on the tube map {{although}} {{the name of the}} local area is generally spelt without. Prior to 1951 tube and rail maps generally show the station name without the <b>apostrophe</b> and on the station buildings the name has variously appeared with and without the <b>apostrophe.</b> The name of the local area has always been shown with an <b>apostrophe</b> on Ordnance Survey maps, and also by A-Z, but other mapmakers do not use one.|$|E

25|$|The {{typewriter}} <b>apostrophe</b> (') was inherited {{by computer}} keyboards, {{and is the}} only <b>apostrophe</b> character available in the (7-bit) ASCII character encoding, at code value 0x27 (39). As such, it is a highly overloaded character. In ASCII, it represents a left single quotation mark, right single quotation mark, <b>apostrophe,</b> vertical line or prime (punctuation marks), or an acute accent (modifier letters).|$|E

25|$|In some Latin transliterations {{of certain}} Cyrillic alphabets (for Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian), the <b>apostrophe</b> {{is used to}} replace the soft sign (ь, {{indicating}} palatalization of the preceding consonant), e.g., Русь is transliterated Rus’ according to the BGN/PCGN system. (The prime symbol is also used for the same purpose.) Some of these transliteration schemes use a double <b>apostrophe</b> (ˮ) to represent the <b>apostrophe</b> in Ukrainian and Belarusian text, e.g. Ukrainian слов’янське ("Slavic") is transliterated as slov"yans’ke.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{business}} name {{is based on}} a family name it should in theory take an <b>apostrophe,</b> but many leave it out (contrast Sainsbury’s with Harrods). In recent times there has been an increasing tendency to drop the <b>apostrophe.</b> Names based on a first name are more likely to take an <b>apostrophe,</b> but this is not always the case. Some business names may inadvertently spell a different name if the name with an s at the end is also a name, such as Parson.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of the United States {{is split}} {{on whether a}} possessive {{singular}} noun that ends with s should always have an additional s after the <b>apostrophe,</b> sometimes have an additional s after the <b>apostrophe</b> (for instance, based on whether the final sound of the original word is pronounced /s/ or /z/), or never have an additional s after the <b>apostrophe.</b> The informal majority view (5–4, based on past writings of the justices) has favoured the additional s, but a strong minority disagrees.|$|E
25|$|In Portuguese the <b>apostrophe</b> is {{also used}} in a few combinations, such as caixa-d’água ("water tower"), galinha-d’angola ("guineafowl"), pau-d’alho ("Gallesia integrifolia"), etc. Portuguese has many contractions between prepositions and {{articles}} or pronouns (like na for em + a), but these are written without an <b>apostrophe.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the pinyin (hànyǔ pīnyīn) {{system of}} romanization for Standard Chinese, an <b>apostrophe</b> is often loosely said to {{separate}} syllables {{in a word}} where ambiguity could arise. Example: the standard romanization {{for the name of}} the city Xī'ān includes an <b>apostrophe</b> to distinguish it from a single-syllable word xian. More strictly, however, it is correct to place an <b>apostrophe</b> only before every a, e, or o that starts a new syllable after the first if it is not preceded by a hyphen or a dash. Examples: Tiān'ānmén, Yǎ'ān; but simply Jǐnán, in which the syllables are ji and nan, since the absence of an <b>apostrophe</b> shows that the syllables are not jin and an (contrast Jīn'ān). This is a kind of morpheme-separation marking (see above).|$|E
