40|$|The present thesis {{examined}} the effects of bilateral perirhinal cortex (PRh) lesions on rats' <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>memory</b> for places and objects. Allocentric place memory was assessed using a standard water maze task and a test of novelty preference, which relies on the ability of rats to detect that an object has moved to a new location. Object-recognition memory was also assessed using a test of novelty preference, which, in this case, relies on the ability of rats to detect that an object is novel. The effects of aspiration and electrolytic PRh lesions were compared on most tests. Findings from the object-recognition tests suggest that the PRh is necessary to support anterograde, but not retrograde, object recognition. By contrast, findings from the place memory tests suggest that the functions of the PRh are important for retrograde, but not <b>anterograde,</b> place <b>memory.</b> Furthermore, on most tests, electrolytic PRh lesions were more effective than aspiration PRh lesions in revealing performance deficits. Evidence that electrolytic, but not aspiration, PRh lesions led to widespread neuronal activation in cortex is also presented and suggests that this lesion method may have adverse consequences for normal brain function that go beyond the functional effects of damage to the PRh. Current views of medial-temporal-lobe function are discussed and it is concluded that few models adequately capture the complex contribution of the PRh to learning and memory that is indicated by the present data...|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the amnesic {{symptoms of}} WKS include both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. The retrograde deficit {{has been demonstrated}} through an inability of WKS patients to recall or recognize information for recent public events. The <b>anterograde</b> <b>memory</b> loss is demonstrated through deficits in tasks that involve encoding and then recalling lists of words and faces, as well as semantic learning tasks. WKS patients have also demonstrated difficulties in preservation as evidenced by a deficit in performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The retrograde amnesia that accompanies WKS can extend {{as far back as}} twenty to thirty years, and there is generally a temporal gradient seen, where earlier memories are recalled better than more recent memories. It has been widely accepted that the critical structures that lead to the memory impairment in WKS are the mammillary bodies, and the thalamic regions. Despite the aforementioned memory deficits, non-declarative memory functions appear to be intact in WKS patients. This has been demonstrated through measures that assess perceptual priming.|$|E
5000|$|... 70% {{of people}} with TEA notice a patchy but {{persistent}} loss of memories of events from their past personal experiences and this autobiographical amnesia {{has been reported in}} all cases in which accelerated forgetting was also present. This memory loss can occur in people whose ability to acquire new memories is intact. Studying this 'autobiographical amnesia' or 'focal retrograde amnesia' or 'delayed onset amnesia' has been challenging because people do not always realize they have forgotten events or periods of time until they have difficulty in retrieving memories of specific significant events, and find they cannot form a coherent recollection. At first they might think they have forgotten some isolated events due to normal forgetting, and not realize they have forgotten larger blocks of past time:"In our experience, patients most often present complaining of islands of memory loss that become apparent when discussing holidays or family events. We now ask patients with suspected TEA if they have gaps in their autobiographical memory, and especially about recall of holidays and other salient personal events. This is not, we would argue, because of the unique status of such events, but rather because it reflects the patchy nature of the remote memory deficit and the vulnerability of singular events. It is unlikely that a single week missing from everyday life would be noticed, owing to the repetitive nature of most day to day activities. In contrast, the loss of memory for last year's holiday brings the retrograde memory loss into sharp relief."These memory deficits have been shown to extend across the entire lifespan and there are significant impairments across a wide range of different types of contextual information including event, place, perceptual and thought/emotion details.

To promote object recognition after such long intervals, rats were familiarized with a sample object in an open field for 5 min/day for 5 consecutive days. Recognition was assessed by comparing {{the amount of time}} spent investigating the sample versus a novel object on a preference test at one of the postlearning intervals. The rats with hippocampal lesions displayed a normal novelty preference after a 3 -week interval, and their performance across the three delay conditions was not significantly different from that of control rats.

40|$|Research {{into the}} neuroanatomical bases of {{long-term}} memory has consistently implicated medial temporal lobe structures, namely the hippocampus, {{to play a}} critical role in the consolidation of newly acquired episodic memory (memory of specific events in a persons life) for long-term storage. The work described in this thesis investigates consolidation of <b>anterograde</b> episodic <b>memory</b> using recognition and source (contextual) behavioural tasks with the addition of extensive neuroimaging techniques to better understand the role of medial temporal lobe structures when this process is intact and when it is impaired. We examined intact consolidation and the cognitive effect of healthy ageing in a sample of young and elderly participants, and impaired consolidation in early stage Alzheimers disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) patients, who show contrasting atrophy in the medial temporal lobe region. Building on previous studies, functional neuroimaging revealed the posterior region of the left hippocampus is crucial for intact long-term consolidation of memories that have a contextual component. Diffusion tensor imaging further revealed greater white matter integrity in the fornix and cingulate, two subcortical structures responsible for efferent and afferent communication with the hippocampus, respectively, also predicted successful consolidation. Behaviourally, cognitive changes associated with healthy ageing showed decreased recognition and source memory retrieval after extended delays, but the same pattern of performance change over time was observed in young and elderly participants. In amnesic patients, AD showed a significant dissociation in the pattern of source memory performance over time compared to controls while in SD this was only observed for recognition memory. Considering atrophy in early stage AD is often reported to be confined to the hippocampus, these results are consistent with the multiple trace model of long-term consolidation. The critical role of the hippocampus and adjacent subcortical structures along the Papez memory circuit in long-term consolidation of <b>anterograde</b> episodic <b>memory</b> is consistent with our findings. In addition, our results from additional testing of a single SD patient found the memory impairment appears to leave implicit long-term memory retrieval intact.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cognitive-MRI {{correlations}} {{have often}} been studied in disorders {{in which there are}} multiple cognitive deficits and widespread cortical atrophy, such as Alzheimer's dementia. In such circumstances, the interpretation of any single cognitive-structural correlation is equivocal. Only by measuring differing cognitive functions and a wide range of brain structures in patients with a varying distribution of lesions or atrophy can specific brain-cognitive relations be determined in neurological disorder. METHOD: In the present study, a clear set of anatomical criteria and detailed MRI segmentation procedures were applied to measure whole brain, and left and right frontal, temporal lobe, anterolateral and medial temporal volumes, as well as thalamic cross sectional areas in 40 patients with organic amnesia (from various diseases) and 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: Within the total patient group, <b>anterograde</b> <b>memory</b> measures correlated significantly with medial temporal, hippocampal, and thalamic measurements. A spatial memory measure correlated significantly with hippocampal volume, and temporal context memory with frontal volume. After a factor analysis of the cognitive measures, the association between <b>anterograde</b> <b>memory</b> and hippocampal volume was corroborated. Forgetting rates and subjective memory evaluations did not show any significant MR correlations and, of executive tests employed, only card sorting categories correlated significantly with frontal volume. CONCLUSION: Loss of volume in key brain structures (for example, hippocampus, thalamus) is detectable on quantitative MRI, and this loss of volume correlates significantly with impaired performance on measures of <b>anterograde</b> <b>memory</b> function. Correlations with hippocampal volume did not indicate a specific role in either recall or verbal memory, as opposed to recognition or visual memory...|$|E
