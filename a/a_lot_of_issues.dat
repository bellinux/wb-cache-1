25|$|Both {{hydrogenation}} and dehydrogenation of LOHCs requires catalysts. It {{was demonstrated}} that replacing hydrocarbons by hetero-atoms, like N, O etc. improves reversible de/hydrogenation properties. The temperature required for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of drops significantly with {{increasing numbers of}} heteroatoms. Among all the N-heterocycles, the saturated-unsaturated pair of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (12H-NEC) and NEC has been considered as a promising candidate for hydrogen storage with a fairly large hydrogen content (5.8wt%). The figure on the top right shows dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of the 12H-NEC and NEC pair. The standard catalyst for NEC to 12H-NEC is Ru and Rh based. The selectivity of hydrogenation can reach 97% at 7 MPa and 130°C-150°C. Although N-Heterocyles can optimize the unfavorable thermodynamic properties of cycloalkanes, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> remain unsolved, such as high cost, high toxicity and kinetic barriers etc.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Patlabor 2s release in 1993, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> had faced the Japanese {{government}} in both the domestic and international level. Most of the issues include {{the end of the}} Soviet Union, Japan's economic prosperity in the 1980s and the 1990s, and outbreak of the Gulf War with the 1990 market crash that left many Japanese devastated. In an interview with Animage magazine on October 1993, Hayao Miyazaki said that the opening scene of the movie was inspired by the local Cambodian scene, especially with the appearance of what seems to be Angkor Thom since Miyazaki said that it is the case. He also mentions with Mamoru Oshii {{on the nature of the}} limitations that JSDF personnel faced in Cambodia, since the JSDF was formed originally not as a sort of military body of the post-WWII Japanese government.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Vancouver during the summer, where {{temperatures}} were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented that despite the heat, guest actor Leonard Nimoy [...] "was doing pages and pages of dialogue, and he handled it like a pro," [...] while co-star Joshua Jackson joked that [...] " [...] wife said he practices biofeedback, so {{he knows how to}} control his body temperature". Chappelle called the episode [...] "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> and a lot of questions. But it's also a springboard into the rest of the season". Actor John Noble, who played Walter Bishop, called it [...] "probably one of our strongest and densest episodes" [...] because it [...] "changes the whole direction of the show".|$|E

[...] It was just a natural progression that became the whole theme of the record.

2500|$|In government, Huhne {{maintained}} a flexible approach {{on the subject}} of nuclear energy, advocating the three-pronged portfolio approach to energy: a commitment to nuclear energy; the development of more renewable energy, such as wind and sea power; and new carbon-capture technology to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial facilities. In an interview with The Observer in March 2011, after the Fukushima disaster in Japan, Huhne stated that: [...] "there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> outside of the realm of nuclear safety, which we will have to assess. One is what the economics of nuclear power post-Fukushima will be, if there is an increase in the cost in capital to nuclear operators." [...] This represents an evolution of his approach to the nuclear issue. In 2007, Huhne was quoted as saying: [...] "Nuclear is a tried, tested and failed technology and the government must stop putting time, effort and subsidies into this outdated industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{episodes of}} the first season {{included}} the original concept from the books, mainly following {{the lives of the}} five wealthy and privileged teenage characters in their high school years. Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) is often described as the 'it girl'. It is revealed that she has had a scandalous past that continues to haunt her throughout the show and she is notorious for her many on-again, off-again relationships with countless male characters as well as for her rebellious drive-outs. Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) is an outsider who becomes a part of the turbulent Manhattan scene, an aspiring writer and fairly straight-arrow guy with a good heart and morals. Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) is the beautiful Queen Bee of Constance Billard School's social scene, as well as Serena's best friend and fierce rival (at points, threatening their relationship). Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford) is the perfect [...] "Golden Boy" [...] of the Upper East Side, always being fought over by the prominent female characters, and deals with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> that compromise his [...] "perfect" [...] life. Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) serves as the show's antihero, being a womanizer and party lover with a troubled life and past that provide a hidden vulnerable side.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know he has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues.</b> Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN rated it 6 out of 10 in his review: [...] "It {{crossed a}} line, {{but not one}} of gore. Or death, even. Not necessarily. It {{basically}} broke the final shred of trust in the show to service characters over gimmickry." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C-, the lowest grade given by the website to the show thus far: [...] "The show is so stupid that it thinks we're stupid, prays we're stupid; cross its fingers and hopes like hell that its legion of loyal, obsessive followers will rend their garments at the horrible death of a fan favorite, but still be back next week." [...] According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, [...] "This was, to put it mildly, uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with something even more unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] "I've had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> with The Walking Dead of late — especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale — but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a “fan” of the show until tonight". Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: [...] "Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones -- not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience." [...] Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote in his review, [...] "It was miserable, and tedious, and made me feel bad. Not in an emotionally compelling way, just in a 'I could be watching something of value' way", and he graded the episode D-. Kristi Turnquist of The Oregonian was also critical: [...] "The most shocking reveal was just how low executive producer and showrunner Scott M. Gimple and [...] "Walking Dead" [...] comics creator Robert Kirkman {{are willing to go}} for the sake of sensationalism and torture porn." ...|$|E
