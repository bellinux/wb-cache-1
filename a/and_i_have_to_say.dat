500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me". All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{expected}} to find that [...] was directly responsible for looting and stealing of paintings that he wanted for himself, and I couldn't find any evidence of it, I found evidence that he paid for them; sometimes at knock-down prices, but not direct theft in any way.

But then it was like, 'Oh no, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> actually perform. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a voice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> thoughts now.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In July 2016, when George Kerevan {{asked her}} {{whether she would}} be {{prepared}} to authorise the killing of a hundred thousand innocent persons by a nuclear strike; during the [...] "Trident debate" [...] inside the House of Commons, May said [...] "Yes. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the honourable gentleman: the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we {{would be prepared to}} use it. Unlike some suggestions that we could have a nuclear deterrent but not actually be willing to use it, which come from the Labour Party frontbench." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "This is {{the sixth}} one I have seen here at San Quentin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{this was very}} different. The most notable thing was that Williams had {{supporters}} {{at the back of}} the room… Mrs. Becnel was among them, I understand. We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, 'The State of California just killed an innocent man!' [...] which is the first time I ever heard any outburst in the death chamber there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{letters to}} a Parliamentary group in March 2010, Tesco and Sainsbury {{stressed}} {{their commitment to}} animal welfare and stated {{that they had no}} plans to buy milk from Nocton. In another letter, Waitrose's managing director Mark Price stated, [...] "a dairy farm of the size proposed would not fit with the Waitrose way of doing business, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I am anxious that it represents the first step along the way towards a highly-industrialised, US approach to farming". [...] On 17 November 2010, Marks & Spencer declared, [...] "M does not buy milk from 'super-dairy' farms and we are committed to our current pool of dedicated dairy farms." [...] Jason Gissing, co-founder of Ocado, said in a letter published on the Ocado web site in December 2010, [...] "Rest assured, Ocado will not be milking it with Nocton.".|$|E

2500|$|The No. 88, {{according}} to NASCAR archives, {{was driven by}} Ralph Earnhardt, his paternal grandfather, in 1957. His maternal grandfather, Robert Gee, {{was one of the}} first employees of All Star Racing, initially a Late Model Sportsman (now Xfinity Series) team with Gee as Hendrick's partner, which is now Hendrick Motorsports. Hendrick said about Earnhardt and his uncles, [...] "I can look at Robert Gee Jr., or Jimmy Gee, or Dale Jr., and all I see is Robert Gee. They're the spitting image of him. I go back and look and pictures from when we did things together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I owe Robert a lot." [...] Starting in the 2008 season, Hendrick Motorsports merged its Nationwide Series team to Earnhardt's JR Motorsports, with the cars coming from Earnhardt's shop, which employs his mother and uncles.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 April, the FA handed Suárez a 10-match ban, after a three-man {{independent}} committee {{agreed that}} the standard three match ban was insufficient. In their written reasons, the FA pointed to Suárez's lackadaisical attitude to the whole incident, citing that he [...] "had not fully appreciated the gravity and seriousness of this truly exceptional incident". They also argued that [...] "these unsavoury pictures would have given a bad image of English football domestically and across the world alike", {{and that it would}} act as a deterrent to further behaviour. Suárez ruled out an appeal, citing recognition of his actions being unacceptable and that it would give [...] "the wrong impression" [...] if he did so. Rodgers launched a strong defence of his player stating that [...] "when you look at it in the cold light of day then it was violent conduct... he made a mistake and he's got a sanction which I don't believe fits with what he did". Rodgers also launched a broadside on the FA and their handling of the case, claiming [...] "prejudices" [...] against the FA led to the lengthy ban, and also pointed out alleged inconsistencies in the prior punishment of players who have bitten another human being, giving the lack of punishment Jermain Defoe received for biting Javier Mascherano in 2006 as an example. After the ban was imposed, Ivanović finally accepted Suárez's apology. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reminded of Eric Cantona's suspension in 1995 for kicking a racist Crystal Palace spectator, and showed empathy toward the situation, saying [...] "I think back to Cantona <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a nine-month ban doesn't equate to a 10-match, does it? I can understand how Liverpool are aggrieved at it, I must say that".|$|E

60|$|When {{this was}} understood, men {{certainly}} did put their shoulders {{to the wheel}} with a great effort. Much abuse {{at the time was}} thrown upon the government; and they who took upon themselves the management of the relief of the poor in the south-west were taken most severely to task. I was in the country, travelling always through it, during the whole period, and I have to say--as I did say at the time with a voice that was not very audible--that in my opinion the measures of the government were prompt, wise, and beneficent; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> also that the efforts of those who managed the poor were, as a rule, unremitting, honest, impartial, and successful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eat, and get {{clothes and}} keep this roof above me. There {{are some very}} disagreeable things in this world called Cold and Rain. And the other people here--how and why is too long a story--have made me a kind of chorus to their lives. They bring their little pink babies to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a name and some other things over each new pink baby. And when the {{children}} have grown to be youths and maidens, they come again and are confirmed. You will understand that better later. Then before they may join in couples and have pink babies of their own, they must come again and hear me read out of a book. They would be outcast, and no other maiden would speak to the maiden who had a little pink baby without I had read over her for twenty minutes out of my book. It's a necessary thing, as you will see. Odd {{as it may seem}} to you. And afterwards when they are falling to pieces, I try and persuade them of a strange world in which I scarcely believe myself, where life is altogether different from what they have had--or desire. And in the end, I bury them, and read out of my book to those who will presently follow into the unknown land. I stand at the beginning, and at the zenith, and at the setting of their lives. And on every seventh day, I who am a man myself, I who see no further than they do, talk to them of the Life to Come--the life of which we know nothing. If such a life there be. And slowly I drop to pieces amidst my prophesying." ...|$|E
