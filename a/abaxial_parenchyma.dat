40|$|The {{development}} of the C 3 monocot Zantedeschia aethiopica floral spathe {{has been used as}} a natural model for studying the physiological and biochemical features of senescence. This photosynthetic leaf-like organ undergoes senescence displaying the common features of leaf senescence, such as loss of protein, chlorophyll and a decline on photosynthetic ability. Fruiting inhibits the ongoing spathe senescence and the regreening of its <b>abaxial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells is observed. Previous results have suggested that during the spathe whitening the peroxisomes differentiate into glyoxysomes and that the regreening process is followed by their conversion back into peroxisomes, resulting in the re-acquisition of photorespiratory capacity. In this work, changes in peroxisomal metabolism were studied in what concerns key-enzymes of glyoxylate and glycolate pathways. An increase in isocitrate lyase (ICL) activity during the late stages of spathe whitening suggests that there is an induction of glyoxysomal metabolism. The increase of hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR) activity during spathe regreening, accompanied with the decrease of the glyoxylate key-enzyme ICL, points to an induction of leaf-type peroxisome metabolism thus suggesting the conversion of glyoxysomes back into peroxisomes. This hypothesis is further supported by the expression analysis of genes encoding enzymes from glycolate and glyoxylate pathways. The results will be discussed taking into account hydrogen peroxide levels evaluated during the time course of Z. aethiopica spathe development.

There are {{numerous}} examples of cell death during plant development that {{conforms to the}} general definition of programmed cell death (PCD). Although several morphological similarities were found between animal cells undergoing apoptosis and dying plant cells, the identity {{of most of the}} key elements involved in plant PCD remain unknown. Proteolytic activity associated with caspase-like proteins is well known to be involved in animal and yeast apoptosis, but their role in plant PCD and in particular in plant senescence is still not clear. We have been using the development of Zantedeschia aethiopica floral spathe as a natural model for studying the physiological and biochemical features of senescence. Soon after its formation, this photosynthetic leaf-like organ undergoes senescence, which leads to the organ death if pollination does not occur. Fruiting inhibits the ongoing spathe senescence and the regreening of its <b>abaxial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells is observed. Previously, in a cDNA macroarray analysis we have identified several proteolytic enzyme genes that were up-regulated during the spathe whitening process. Although these genes are most probably involved in the execution of senescence program, it could be also possible that early induced genes could code for a signal protease activity. In this work, the progression of typical morphological and biochemical features of PCD, such as fragmentation of the nucleus and internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, will be evaluated during spathe development. In order to address the question of whether caspase-like proteolytic activity is involved in the regulation of the senescence process we have determined the activity of the most common caspases in plants during spathe development. Activity for caspase- 6 (VEIDase) was higher than that of other caspases studied, suggesting that VEIDase is the principal caspase-like activity in Z. aethiopica.

40|$|Apresentação efectuada no Oxidative Stress and Cell Signalling IBMC Advanced Course, 27 a 29 Outubro 2004, Porto. Plant {{senescence}} is {{a natural}} regulated and programmed process that leads ultimately to cell death. Numerous studies in different plant species have suggested a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the progress of senescence programs, which is frequently associated with the degradative aspects of senescence physiology. The general increase of ROS during leaf aging {{as well as their}} damage products are probably due to the induction of the generating systems of these oxidative species and/or to a decrease in the protective mechanisms against activated oxygen forms. In this work the development of the C 3 monocot Zantedeschia aethiopica floral spathe {{has been used as a}} natural model for studying the physiological and biochemical features of senescence. This photosynthetic leaf-like organ undergoes senescence displaying the common features of leaf senescence, such as loss of protein, chlorophyll and a decline on photosynthetic ability. Fruiting inhibits the ongoing spathe senescence and the regreening of its <b>abaxial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells is observed. Previous studies have shown that during the time course of spathe development some dramatic changes occurs, namely in the ultraestructure of chloroplasts and peroxisomes. Some evidences suggest that during the spathe whitening peroxissomes differentiate into glyoxysomes and chloroplasts into amyloplasts. The regreening process is followed by the restructuration of chloroplasts and peroxisomes, resulting in the re-acquisition of photosynthetic and photorespiratory capacities. In order to clarify the role of oxidative stress metabolism in spathe senescence two cytosolic ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes (cytCuZn-SOD and csAPX), directly involved in the antioxidant cellular mechanism were studied. The corresponding expression analysis was correlated with H 2 O 2 content and lipid peroxidation level during the time course of Z. aethiopica spathe development suggesting an initial burst of H 2 O 2 in the cytosol that could serve as a signal for the progression of the senescence program during spathe whitening. An integrated approach involving EST analysis and multiparallel expression profiling by macroarray analysis of senescence associated genes and oxidative stress related genes was also undertaken. Expression profile of oxidative stress related genes seems to parallel the expression profile of senescence associated genes suggesting an involvement of ROS in signalling and in degradative processes during Z. aethiopica spathe senescence.

40|$|Vismia guianensis (Aubl.) Choisy is a {{tree that}} belongs to the {{secondary}} vegetation in rainforests. This study aimed to perform anatomy analysis by light microscopy; scanning and microchemistry of the leaves of V. guianensis. Tri stratified upper epidermis with intense cutinization and unistratified inferior epidermis was observed. The stomata found are paracytic and the trichomes arranged in rosettes are glandular, multicellular, stellate shape covered with cuticle, which were present on the <b>abaxial</b> surface. <b>Parenchyma</b> cells with idioblasts containing druses of calcium oxalate crystals were also found. The mesophyll is dorsiventral and the midrib is concave on the adaxial surface and convex on the opposite surface. The microchemical tests detected the presence of starch grains in the chlorophyll cells and phenolic compounds dispersed in the palisade tissue and abaxial surface. Alkaloids in the epidermis and in the sclerenchyma cells surrounding the vascular bundles and the midrib xylem, dispersed flavonoid in the palisade parenchyma and trichomes, fatty substances as content of the secretory ducts and reducing sugars in the palisade and epidermal cells were found. These anatomical features were fundamental in the identification and characterization of the species...|$|R
40|$|For the {{recovery}} of a degraded area to occur in a satisfactory way, {{it is essential to}} elucidate the ecology of native tree species. This study aimed to evaluate the morpho-anatomical response of P. lambertii after 18 months of deployment in different conditions of light, considering as a factor of change areas with different degrees of succession on margins of the Iraí Reservoir, at the time of establishment of the experiment. For this, aspects of morphology (leaf area, dry weight, specific leaf area, stomatal density), anatomy (thickness of cuticle, adaxial epidermis, palisade parenchyma, transfusion <b>parenchyma,</b> spongy <b>parenchyma,</b> <b>abaxial</b> epidermis and total thickness) and development (height, diameter and survival) were evaluated. The results showed that P. lambertii made a significant difference to the leaf area, being higher for individuals of regenerating forestry. For the stomatal density, cuticle thickness, palisade and spongy parenchyma, total thickness, height and diameter were significantly higher for individuals in the open field. The rate of survival was similar for both areas. Thus, P. lambertii under the conditions of this study has proved itself able to adapt to conditions that have either greater or lesser availability of irradiance. However, it presents a more satisfactory development in conditions of intermediate light...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative {{propagation}} is {{very important}} for the survival of species with long juvenile and adult vegetative phases, as it is the case for bulbous plants. Bulbous plants are ornamental geophytes with a bulb as an underground storage organ. Among flower bulbs, tulip and lily are the two commercially leading plants in The Netherlands. Tulip propagates vegetatively via axillary bud outgrowth, while lily propagates via adventitious bulblet formation. The vegetative propagation rate in tulip is very low due to the limited amount of axillary buds that will grow successfully. Moreover, tulip is very recalcitrant to in vitro regeneration. On the other hand, lily propagates efficiently via adventitious bulblet formation, either naturally from the underground portion of the stem of the apical bud, or artificially from detached bulb scales. This thesis study aimed to understand how axillary bud outgrowth is controlled in tulip bulbs and how regeneration capacity is established in lily bulb scales. As a first step towards these goals, {{the state of the art}} of the molecular control of sexual and vegetative reproduction was reviewed for model species. Moreover, two approaches, “bottom-up” and “top-down”, to transfer the knowledge from model to non-model species were described (Chapter 2). In short, the “bottom-up” approach usually goes from individual genes to systems, assuming conservation of molecular pathways and using sequence homology searches to identify candidate genes. ”Top-down” methodologies go from systems to genes, and are based on large scale transcriptome profiling via  e. g. microarrays or RNA sequencing, followed by the identification of associations between phenotypes, genes, and gene expression patterns and levels. Next (Chapter 3), two sets of high quality transcriptomes, one for tulip and one for lily were generated  from a collection of several tissues using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Several assembly filtering parameters were applied, to highlight the limitations of stringent but routinely used filtering in de novo transcriptome assembly. The final created transcriptomes were made publicly available via a user friendly Transcriptome browser ([URL] and their usefulness was exemplified by a search for all potential transcription factors in lily and tulip, with special focus on the TCP transcription factor family. One TCP member was of special interest because it has proven to integrate several pathways that control axillary bud outgrowth in a wide range of species. It is called TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB 1) in monocots and BRNACHED 1 (BRC 1) in dicots. A Tulipa gesneriana TB 1 transcript was identified from the generated transcriptome and subsequently, tulip axillary bud outgrowth was studied through a “bottom-up” approach (Chapter 4). The degree of axillary bud outgrowth in tulip determines the success of their vegetative propagation. However the number of axillary meristems in one bulb is low –six on average– and not all of them seem to have the same growth capacity. The combination of physiological and targeted molecular experiments indicated that the first two inner located buds do not seem to experience dormancy (assessed by weight increase and TgTB 1 expression) at any point of the growth cycle, while mid-located buds enter dormancy by the end of the growing season. Moreover it was shown that TgTB 1 expression in tulip bulbs can be modulated by sucrose, cytokinin and strigolactone, just as it has been reported for other species. However, the limited growth of mid-located buds even when their TgTB 1 expression was naturally or artificially downregulated, pointed at other factors, probably physical, inhibiting their growth. Next, the remarkable regeneration capacity of lily by initiating de novo shoot meristems from excised bulb scales without the addition of exogenous hormones or growth regulators was studied using a “top-down” approach (Chapter 5). An extensive and comprehensive transcriptome set was generated from lily bulb scales in a time-series using two cultivars and two explant types, all differing in regeneration capacity. This set up provided first insight in the key molecular process underlying pro-meristem induction and meristem initiation in lily. We found that wounding activates a very fast regeneration response, probably mediated by APETALA 2 /ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTORS (AP 2 /ERF,) such as LoERF 115 and WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 2 (LoWIND 2), which in turn might mediate polar auxin re-distribution, cell proliferation and de-differentiation. Moreover, the timing and level of induction of shoot meristem regulators, such as ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION 2 (LoESR 2) and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (LoSTM) correlated with the regeneration capacity of the scale. Regardless the regeneration capacity of the different explants e. g. cultivar or position within the scale, regeneration occurs at the proximal-adaxial side of the bulb scale, right on top of the excision line. Thus the possible cellular and physiological factors granting lily bulb scales their competence to regenerate was investigated (Chapter 6). We found that the adaxial parenchyma tissue seems to be more competent than the abaxial tissue, partially because of higher number of secondary veins and larger cell population than the <b>abaxial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> region. It was proposed that upon explant excision, the polar auxin transport is disrupted, creating an auxin maximum at the excision line, which might create a gradient of cell divisions favouring the adaxial parenchyma tissue. The direction of this cell division gradient proved to be negatively affected by the absence of the adaxial epidermis. Moreover, explants without epidermis reduced dramatically their regeneration capacity, and lost the typical proximal-adaxial orientation of regeneration. Thus, a better understanding of the composition and physiology of the epidermis in lily bulb scales is essential to identify the regeneration stimulating signals originating from this tissue layer in Lilium sp. Finally in Chapter 7, integration of all the results was done and I addressed how this may contributes to the fundamental and applied understanding of vegetative propagation in bulbous plants. Also, some challenges are discussed, for example, the complexity in the architecture of tulip bulbs and how this influences ways for improving its rate of axillary bud outgrowth. The challenge to prove the findings of this thesis through functional analysis is also discussed and the possibility of using transient virus-induced gene silencing is highlighted. Moreover, the potential of lily bulb scales as a model system to study some aspects of de novo regeneration, as well as to study the recalcitrance of in vitro propagation is highlighted, supporting the idea that  more “omics” data and biotechnological tools for bulbous plant research are necessary...|$|E
