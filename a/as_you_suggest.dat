500|$|It is {{doubtful}} {{whether it was}} possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet, there being no normal mechanism to do so, but the Prime Minister's response was supportive: [...] "I have known you long, and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations upon your loyalty to the British Crown. The King is not prepared to take any step such <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> in regard to the marks of distinction which you have received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence." [...] On 26 May 1915, Speyer and his family left for America.|$|E
6000|$|... "But supposing {{all this}} turned out <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> it might, how could {{even the best}} {{disposed}} friend {{do anything to help}} us?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> let the executions fixed for Friday the 19th instant be {{postponed}} to, {{and be done}} on, Friday the 26th instant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I {{should tell}} you that I did <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> to me. I asked Alec MacKenzie pointblank, and he confessed that he was guilty of George's death.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he protested, [...] "even if I did <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> {{and went}} back into politics, it would be some time, if ever, before I should be any better off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{called the}} boys together, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> and fixed up the meeting for to-night," [...] he said. [...] "They'll {{be ready to}} give you a hearing, after supper, in the hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|Flora Schuyler smiled satirically. [...] "I fancy I do, though I may be mistaken. Subtleties of {{this kind}} are, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> beyond the average woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, we have {{considered}} your proposal; we agree {{to accept it}} for the moment. We will come again, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> in a month's time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Adrea, {{you talk}} like a child," [...] he said sternly. [...] "I made no such {{insinuation}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest!</b> You know that I did not! Sit down!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{two places}} appeal {{to me at}} present, heaven (not hell <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested),</b> and Grosvenor Square. Perhaps, however, they are the same; at any rate, there is an angel in both of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There will be {{seating for}} fifty, sir, and {{standing}} room for fifty," [...] he announced. [...] "I {{have had the}} ring slightly enlarged, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> and the lighting is being altered so that the start is exactly north and south." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I will. Maybe he {{will give}} me a list of {{those who knew him}} in the army, and then I can start a grand search, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested.</b> But I've got a little plan of my own to carry out first, and I want you girls to help me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, {{all that}} is not done easily. One must have the faith--and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> the money with which to make the start. Even then the ladder is hard to climb." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{had another}} pause, while the shopman only waited. [...] "If I were to accept from {{you one of}} these charming little {{ornaments}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> what should I do with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, quite true, my love," [...] {{replied the}} mother, sinking {{back into her}} easy-chair. [...] "You had better go now, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> and calm {{yourself}} by writing to your friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Rachel, somehow I {{think it}} best {{that you should}} go, not only for Noie's sake, but for your own. If your father would leave here to-day or to-morrow, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> it might be otherwise, but he won't do that, so it is no use talking of it. Let us hope for the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Either that or {{the beast}} {{has led the}} man upon a wrong trail," [...] replied the other, [...] "for the way which we took {{is by far the}} shorter to this point--for him who knows it. John Carter would have found it a short road to death had he taken it <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, Malchus, can, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> {{go down to}} the port; ask {{the sailors}} and {{fishermen}} what will become of their trade were the Roman galleys cruising in our bay. Point out that our conquests in Spain have already caused the greatest alarm in Rome, and that under Hannibal our arms will so flourish that Rome will be glad {{to come to terms with}} us, and to leave us free to trade with the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "The problem," [...] Jimmy had begun, [...] "is one which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> {{presents}} certain--" [...] {{when there}} was a knock at the door and the head of the boarding-house's maid-of-all-work popped in.|$|E
6000|$|... "There may be cases such <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> Sir Timothy," [...] {{the detective}} said quietly. [...] "Our investigations, {{so far as}} regards {{the young man in}} question, however, do not point that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father," [...] {{said our}} hero {{with a modest}} look, [...] "it may be, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> that Winnie Van der Kemp does not care for me more than for a fathom of salt water--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think I shall," [...] said Frank, slowly. [...] "For I fancy she has got {{a hidden}} self, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> and I'd rather like to find it out. One judges people so much by {{externals}} {{that it is not}} fair. Now, you, for instance, if you won't mind my saying it, don't show half your good points; and a casual observer would consider you merely a fashionable woman,--lovely, but shallow." ...|$|R
40|$|Leila W. Sherman, 404 South Arroyo Drive, Pasadena, California, USA, letter, [1939 November], to Hamlin Garland, [2045 De Mille Drive, Laughlin Park, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA]. "The mails between Pasadena and Los Angeles {{are always}} exasperatingly slow and Mr. Sherman and I are {{especially}} disappointed that your most kind note {{asking us to}} call on you on last Sunday afternoon did not reach us until Monday morning {{and so we were}} naturally unable to do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested.</b> " [...] first line...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} was to have met you at Parker's." [...] The {{conversation}} no longer included Mr. Hicks or the subject he had introduced; after a moment's hesitation, he walked away {{to another part of}} the ship. As soon as he was beyond ear-shot, Staniford again spoke: [...] "Dunham, this girl is plainly one of those cases of supernatural innocence, on the part of herself and her friends, which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> wouldn't occur among any other people in the world but ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} privileged,' said Psmith, 'to hear Comrade Bickersdyke speak both in his sanctum and in public. He has, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> a ready flow of speech. What, exactly {{was the cause}} of the turmoil?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} cunning of the Coyote, my captain," [...] cried Pesita. [...] "It shall be done <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> Go now, and I will send for Captain Byrne, {{and give him}} his orders for the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|I'll send Eugene to him, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> [...] Meanwhile prepare him. Make your stand-point this: [...] Children are needful to my dynasty, [...] And if {{one woman}} cannot mould them for me, [...] Why, then, another must.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, sir. I'm sure I'm {{doing just}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested.</b> I've {{said nothing about}} leaving, but I'm {{beginning}} to grumble a bit at the work, so as to pave the way. It's a hard job, and no mistake. I had thirty-nine chops between one and half-past, single-handed, too, with only a boy to carry the bread and that, and no one to serve the drinks unless {{they go to the}} counter for them. It's more than one man's work, Mr. Laverick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Dear Mr. Carvalho' (you'd better begin so, or he'll know I {{dictated}} it),--'I was {{too much}} surprised at your strange conduct last night {{to give you an}} answer immediately. On thinking it over, I can only say I am astonished you should have supposed such a thing <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> lay within the bounds of possibility. In future, it will be well that we should avoid one another. Our spheres are different. Pray do not repeat your mistake of last evening.--Yours truly, E. Hazleden.' Have you put all that down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well." [...] He rose. [...] "You {{will leave}} these with me, and the wallet <b>as</b> well, if <b>you</b> please. I am {{on my way}} to confer with the members of the Council of Regency, and I am glad to go armed with so stout a weapon as this. Whatever may be the {{ultimate}} finding of the court-martial, the present assumption must be that Samoval met the death of a spy caught in the act, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested.</b> That is the only conclusion the Portuguese Government can draw when I lay these papers before it. They will effectively silence all protests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{believe in}} the disloyalty of Prince Ludwig," [...] he said, [...] "nor could I, even if I desired it, take such drastic steps <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> Some day the Princess Emma, his daughter, will be my queen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{promise for}} George," [...] I said; [...] "a little thing will {{sometimes}} irritate him, as you know. If such an accident <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> happen, {{he may be}} cross, but I will undertake {{to explain to him}} that it was not your fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try to {{understand}} how I'm situated. I may have my sympathies, but I can't be a partizan; my business is to see you do your work. Suppose I do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> will it make any trouble in the camp? I want a straight answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I know I {{heard it}} in crowded places; in the {{pounding}} of the forges, and the rumble of the mills. I've heard it a little plainer in the wash beneath the liner's bows and the din the Pacific express made crossing the silent prairie with the Empress mails. Still, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> I wouldn't grasp its message until one night I sat in the bluff and heard the birch twigs whispering while you rested in the wagon. Then I knew I was an idler and a trifler; one who stood aside while the others took their fill of the joys and pains of life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the calmest {{season of}} the year, the surf will hinder any such operation. And you will also {{bear in mind that}} if landing were {{possible}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>suggesting,</b> that landing could not be covered by the ships' guns. In fact, it is the landing parties would be in danger from their own artillery." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, {{among your}} silly empty tradesmen, {{let them be}} as foolish and empty other ways <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>suggest,</b> though <b>you</b> can learn no {{philosophy}} from them, you may learn many things in trade from them, and something from every one; for {{though it is not}} absolutely necessary that every tradesman should be a philosopher, yet every tradesman, in his way, knows something that even a philosopher may learn from.|$|R
