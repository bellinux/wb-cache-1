40|$|INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K antagonists of the {{coumarin}} type {{are widely}} used oral anticoagulants. OBJECTIVE: We developed a transition algorithm for the maintenance dosages of three frequently used coumarins: warfarin, phenprocoumon and <b>acenocoumarol.</b> METHODS: The study was conducted at the Leiden Anticoagulation Clinic. Patients were participants in a trial of which the main objective was to compare the quality of an oral anticoagulant therapy with phenprocoumon to warfarin. We included patients who initiated oral anticoagulant therapy and patients who were already using <b>acenocoumarol.</b> Patients were randomized to a treatment with warfarin or phenprocoumon.

We analysed the switch from <b>acenocoumarol</b> to warfarin or phenprocoumon at the start of follow-up and the switch of warfarin to phenprocoumon at the end of follow-up and calculated the transition factors for stable anticoagulation between these three vitamin K antagonists. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients switched from warfarin to phenprocoumon, 39 from <b>acenocoumarol</b> to phenprocoumon and 44 from <b>acenocoumarol</b> to warfarin. The maintenance dose of warfarin was 0. 41 (95 %CI 0. 39 - 0. 43) times the maintenance dose of phenprocoumon.

40|$|Abstract Warfarin is {{employed}} {{more frequently than}} <b>acenocoumarol</b> because of its longer half-life (36 h), theoretically providing more stable anticoagulation, and avoiding factor VII fluctuations that potentially occur during <b>acenocoumarol</b> treatment (half-life 10 h).

Then, patients initially on <b>acenocoumarol</b> received placebo (and vice versa) for 14 weeks. Therapy efficacy was assessed by comparing the frequency of vasoocclusive complications, the occurrence of bleeding, and clotting activation between <b>acenocoumarol</b> and placebo treatment of each individual patient. Twenty-two patients (14 homozygous [HbSS] and 8 double heterozygous sickle-C [HbSC]; aged 20 - 59 years) completed the entire study. <b>Acenocoumarol</b> treatment did not result in a significant reduction of acute vasoocclusive events (three painful crises during <b>acenocoumarol,</b> five painful crises during placebo). There was a marked reduction of the hypercoagulable state (depicted by a decrease in plasma levels of prothrombin F 1. 2 fragments [P = 0. 002], thrombin-antithrombin complexes [P = 0. 003], and D-dimer fragments [P = 0. 001]) without the occurrence of major bleeding. Even though no clinical benefit (pertaining to the frequency of painful crises) was detected in this pilot study, the value of low adjusted-dose <b>acenocoumarol</b> for preventing specific events (such as strokes) and as a long-term treatment of sickle cell patients should be subject of further stud...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the European Pharmacogenetics of Anticoagulant Therapy (EU-PACT) <b>acenocoumarol</b> dose algorithms in an independent data set. The EU-PACT trial investigates the added value of pretreatment genotyping for use of warfarin, phenprocoumon and <b>acenocoumarol.</b> PATIENTS & METHODS: External validation was performed in the Rotterdam Study cohort using information about 707 <b>acenocoumarol</b> users. R(2), which measures the strength of correlation between the predicted and observed <b>acenocoumarol</b> dose, mean absolute error and mean squared error were calculated to {{evaluate the}} performance of the original algorithm. RESULTS: Validation resulted in a R(2) of 52. 7 and 12. 9 % compared with an R(2) of 52. 6 and 17. 8 % in the original study for the genotype-guided and nongenotype-guided dose algorithm, respectively. For the genotype-guided dose algorithm, the mean absolute error was 0. 48 mg/day and the mean squared error was 0. 38 (mg/day) (2). For the nongenotype-guided dose algorithm, the mean absolute error was 0. 62 mg/day and the mean squared error was 0. 63 (mg/day) (2). CONCLUSION: The EU-PACT <b>acenocoumarol</b> algorithm performs just as accurately in this study as in the original study, which implies applicability in various populations...|$|E
