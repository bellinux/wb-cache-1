5|$|The conspirators practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of Rajneesh communes if the plan was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the Rajneesh commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her that this was not a solution in any way and would be <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> action.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{was less}} {{successful}} in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> 1956 Tour of England, where the 'spin twins' Laker and Lock destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at Headingley, a game dubbed Laker's Match.|$|E
25|$|With a {{decimated}} roster, the Jets finished dead last in {{the league}} {{for the next two}} seasons, including <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> nine-win season in 1980–81 that still ranks as the worst in Jets/Coyotes history. This stands in marked contrast to the other 1979 Avco Cup finalist, the Oilers, who {{became one of the most}} successful teams during the 1980s.|$|E

5000|$|Even {{a benefit}} match for David [...] "Sid" [...] Lawrence, staged after he {{suffered}} <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> knee injury while on tour with England in new Zealand, couldn’t reignite {{the passion for}} the club, although the game was quite an eye opener for some, with Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed fooling all and sundry with his vast repertoire of deliveries, including Duncan Boase behind the stumps.|$|R
5000|$|Howard {{accused the}} Beazley {{opposition}} of relentless negativity {{in relation to}} the government's economic reforms. The Beazley opposition proposed to roll back the GST and undo the government's industrial relations reforms. Howard said of the Hawke-Keating economic legacy that it had [...] "left us with <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> debt legacy, they drove interest rates to unconscionable heights, they were insensitive to the plight of the average worker through levels of unemployment".|$|R
25|$|In {{the wrath}} of <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> start to the season, United had {{scheduled}} a friendly against the Italian Serie A giants, A.C. Milan. Although missing several of their regular starters, it {{was expected to be}} a very, ugly, one-sided match. Ironically, United would pull of a shock 3–2 victory over Milan in front of nearly 31,000 fans at RFK Stadium.|$|E
25|$|After the tourney, David Estrada was {{released}} from the team and undrafted goalkeeper Travis Worra was signed to provide depth at the position after Willis' departure. The team travelled to Costa Rica to fight Alajuelense in the quarterfinals of the CCL. Bill Hamid struggled with a back issue and stayed home while backup Andrew Dykstra was given the starting job. Unfortunately, several errors by Dykstra and the defense led D.C. United to <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> 2–5 defeat.|$|E
25|$|The Giants were {{expected}} to contend in 2006 with a strong starting staff. Despite a losing streak in May, and the worst batting performance by Barry Bonds in about fifteen years the Giants did contend in the less-than-stellar Western Division and by July 23 were in first place. On that day, however, during the last game of a homestand and leading San Diego going into the ninth inning, closer Armándo Benítez blew a save with a tying home run and the Giants lost in extra innings. That was the first loss of <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> three-week stretch that saw San Francisco go 3–16, losing nine games by one run.|$|E

50|$|At club level, O'Neill {{played for}} Leicester City, QPR, and Norwich City. However, his spell with the Canaries was cut short, {{and he made}} just one {{appearance}} for Norwich - against Wimbledon in 1987. On the field for just 34 minutes, <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> tackle from Dons player John Fashanu so severely damaged O'Neill's knee ligaments that he never played another professional game, and finished his playing career. O'Neill began legal proceedings against Fashanu for the tackle that ended his career, before settling out of court for £70,000.|$|R
25|$|Bellamy {{played a}} huge part in Cardiff's end of season push for {{promotion}} to the Premier League, creating numerous chances for teammates which led to several assists and man of the match worthy performances. His talismanic influence was particularly evident in the 2–2 draw with league leaders Queens Park Rangers in April in which he scored the second goal. However, Cardiff led twice in the game before Adel Taarabt's brace held them to a draw. Automatic promotion was still a possibility if Cardiff won their remaining games in the season. However <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> 3–0 home defeat to Middlesbrough condemned Cardiff {{to settle for a}} 4th-place finish and a play off spot for the second season running.|$|E
25|$|The season {{starts with}} a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley, which is widely {{anticipated}} as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds's captain Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> start to the season and {{are in danger of}} relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being 'cold-hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled.|$|E
500|$|Hart {{tried to}} help. In February 1926, he wrote The Saturday Evening Post and {{encouraged}} them to publish Flood's biography so [...] "that... the rising generation may know the real from the unreal", but Flood was <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> writer, and publisher after publisher rejected the manuscript. Several copies were made and sold in 1981, and the original carbon copy of the typed manuscript, found among Josephine Earp's papers, was given by Glenn Boyer to the Ford County Historical Society.|$|E
50|$|Baker {{comes from}} Leeds, and played {{for four years}} with Leeds City Boys. He was {{originally}} on the books of Leeds United as a schoolboy. However, he was signed as an apprentice at Hull City in 1996 and progressed through the youth ranks and turned professional in 1998. However, he suffered <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> knee injury which sidelined him for a season, but he eventually made two substitute appearances for the first team. He also made a sub appearance in the League Cup against Liverpool at Anfield, after Lee Bracey was sent off. He was released, after a spell on loan at Bradford Park Avenue, in 2000.|$|R

40|$|This MA {{thesis is}} divided into three parts. 1) A Preface, which {{concerns}} the act of writing this work, with a reflections on the attendant difficulties regarding editing and editorial distance. A placement of the poetry in relation to "South African writing", and to late 20 th century poetry. A brief elucidation of the poems' preoccupations and concems. 2) Two Essays, entitled "Dear Warlock-Williams: Why of Course: The Lonely Larkin" and 'William Empson : His Modem Escape". The first concerns Philip Larkin's uncanny ability to create a beauty out of irony, isolation, and desolation, his achievement of transcendence from entrapment. The second essay deals with William Empson's unique poetic position: a truly modem one. The essays puts forward the idea that Empson's poetry can be regarded as a struggle between a wish for escape and a need to engage with <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> "objective" reality. In other words, his struggle is between poetry and plain speaking; between art and science. 3) The Poems, which form a group of forty written throughout 1997 / 8. They have been thoroughly edited several times over, in close consultation with Assoc. Prof. Stephen Watson of the Department of English...|$|R

[...] He alleges what he calls a [...] "double shakedown" [...] by [...] "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" [...] seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} course and {{development}} of British planning to commemorate the First World War. It highlights the fact that any commentary on that war in Britain has {{to take account of}} the prevailing cultural norms. These norms have evolved through much of the poetry, literature, theatre and film of the past century, and have come to represent the war as essentially futile, with <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> loss of life, best commemorated through the annual acts of remembrance for the fallen. As this national memory paid scant attention to the many works of revisionist military history written over the last generation, military historians were among the more sceptical when the UK government belatedly announced plans (and derisory levels of government funding) to commemorate the First World War. However, the Heritage Lottery Fund has filled the funding gap with £ 57 million, enabling all manner of projects to flourish whether of national, regional or local significance. By 4 - 5 August 2014, over 2, 330 events, including 519 exhibitions, had been held, and numerous events marked the outbreak of the war. Poppies were again to the fore, most notably the 800, 000 ceramic poppies, one for each fallen serviceman, at the Tower of London...|$|R
50|$|United's first Champions League fixture of {{the season}} came on 14 September, at home to Rangers. With a home league match against Liverpool {{approaching}} on the following Sunday, Alex Ferguson {{took the opportunity to}} rest several of his first-team players; only Darren Fletcher remained from the team that faced Everton on the previous Saturday. Nevertheless, both Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand returned to the team. Although United had the most shots during the game - most of them long-range efforts from Darron Gibson - they were unable to break down the Rangers defence, and the match finished as a goalless draw. In addition to a sub-par performance, United's misery was compounded by <b>an</b> <b>horrendous</b> injury to Antonio Valencia; in a fair challenge with Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot, the Ecuadorian winger caught his foot in the turf and suffered a dislocated and broken left ankle, with ligament damage. It was expected that Valencia would miss most of the rest {{of the season}}. This was confirmed after an operation the morning after the match, with Ferguson stating late February as a possible return date. He eventually made his return on 12 March after a six-month absence as a half-time substitute against Arsenal at Old Trafford in the Sixth Round of the FA Cup.|$|R
50|$|Despite the improvements, {{the circuit}} became unsafe for the {{increasingly}} faster and stiffer ground effect cars {{of the late}} 1970s and <b>a</b> few <b>horrendous,</b> sometimes fatal accidents (such as those that {{claimed the lives of}} Helmut Koinigg and François Cevert). Increasingly rowdy segments of the crowd began to tarnish its image as well. Finally, in May, 1981, several months after Alan Jones had won the 1980 race for Williams, the International Auto Sports Federation removed the race from its schedule because the track had failed to pay its $800,000 debt to the teams.|$|R

[...] However, during the play, he injured his right thumb. [...] An MRI revealed torn ligaments, requiring surgery and forcing him to miss the next eight to 12 weeks. [...] Regarding the injury as having a significance impact on the Cardinals' season, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bernie Miklasz commented, [...] "Losing the best catcher {{in the world for}} the next 8 to 12 weeks with a torn thumb ligament is <b>a</b> <b>horrendous,</b> demoralizing setback for the Cardinals.

500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Last Rites/Loved to Deth", {{consists}} of two parts. The first part, [...] "Last Rites", is an instrumental segue featuring a piano intro, a reinterpretation of J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Mustaine explained that [...] "Loved to Deth" [...] was his [...] "version of a love song" [...] to his girlfriend at the time. The title track was inspired by The Punisher comic book, and tells of a paid serial assassin. The song caused minor media controversy when a man posted an online request to a radio station to play the tune, saying it was [...] "good music to go postal and kill {{a bunch of people}} to". The man was later arrested under suspicion of commencing a potential shooting spree. [...] "The Skull Beneath the Skin" [...] was developed under the working title [...] "Self Destruct". The song graphically describes <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> human torture, while also probing into the occult and black magic. Mustaine pointed that the creation of Vic Rattlehead was explained throughout that track. [...] "Rattlehead", according to Dave Mustaine, was dedicated to the band's mascot and their fans.|$|E

It was also Berk's favorite; he commented, [...] "I still melt at Artie's serenade", and gave it four stars out of five. Gonzalez and Benigno both gave it an [...] "A", and the latter explained: [...] "the {{arrangement}} ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel", and [...] "this nerdy white boy has himself some soul." [...] Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row [...] "is a tad boring". While most reviewers disliked [...] "Friday" [...] in the original, Rebecca Black version, the commentary for the prom incarnation sung by Puck, Sam and Artie was generally positive despite this—Gonzalez said she hated herself [...] "for giving this horrendously addictive version of <b>a</b> <b>horrendous</b> song a B." [...] VanDerWerff said the song was [...] "way, way, way too long, though it was more fun than [...] expected it to be", Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it [...] "darn good and infectious", and Mullins said it was [...] "much catchier than the original". Benigno gave the song an [...] "A−", and called it a [...] "rafter-raiser".|$|E
