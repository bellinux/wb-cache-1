5|$|Entering the season, Boudreau had amassed 189 wins in 309 NHL games. The win total put him {{on track}} to surpass Don Cherry as the fastest head coach to reach 200 NHL victories. After {{reaching}} 199 wins, Washington went on <b>a</b> <b>four-game</b> losing streak before finally earning Boudreau the milestone win. Despite the losing streak, Boudreau registered his 200th win in 326 games, eclipsing Cherry's previous mark of 341 games.

5|$|In 1998, the Giants {{were unable}} to build on their {{successful}} 1997 season, and needed <b>a</b> <b>four-game</b> winning streak to close out the season at 8–8. The Giants strength was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense {{continued to be a}} disappointment. Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an upset of the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15).|$|E
