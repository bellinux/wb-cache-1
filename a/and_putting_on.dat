5|$|On {{the second}} day, Yardley {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Australian batsmen by employing leg theory, a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack. As England had batted poorly in the first innings, allowing Australia {{to take the lead}} quickly, the home team sought to slow the tourists' momentum and force a drawn match. Despite the tactics, Australia reached 293/4 {{at the end of the}} day's play, captain Donald Bradman having registered his 28th Test century. Although Bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at England's stifling tactics, they remained patient as there was still much time left in the match for them to convert their dominance into a victory. The next morning, Bradman departed for 138, the first in a series of dismissals in the leg trap, but his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett continued, making 137 <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509, giving them a 344-run first innings lead. Laker was the leading bowler, taking 4/138. England reached 121/2 by stumps on the third day, which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to Miller, who bowled a large amount of bouncers at Len Hutton and Denis Compton.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} another triumph for the leg-spin attack of O'Reilly and Grimmett, but O'Reilly was {{slightly}} overshadowed by his teammate in the Tests. With 44 wickets, Grimmett {{set a new}} record {{for the number of}} wickets by an Australian in a Test series, and he raised his Test career total to 216 wickets, beating the then world record of 189 by Englishman Sydney Barnes. O'Reilly took 27 Test wickets at an average of just over 17 runs each: the other bowlers in the Australian team took 27 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O'Reilly came out ahead of Grimmett, with 95 wickets against Grimmett's 92, and an average of 13.56 against 14.80. O'Reilly also revealed hitherto undiscovered batting talents, making an undefeated 56 in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 69 for the last wicket with Ernie McCormick. It was the only time in his first-class cricket career that he passed 50. During the tour, O'Reilly developed his leg trap; the opening batsmen Jack Fingleton and Bill Brown were used in these positions.|$|E
25|$|He toured New Zealand in 1955–56, scoring 64 in the First Test <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 162 for {{the fourth}} wicket with Everton Weekes in 100 minutes. He was less {{successful}} with the bat {{in the next three}} Tests, finishing the series with 78 runs at 15.60, but his off-spin brought 13 wickets at 18.53, including 2 for 1 and 4 for 75 in the Second Test.|$|E

In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic salve. Drinking rainwater out of the footprint of the animal in question or from certain enchanted streams were also considered effectual modes of accomplishing metamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2003, {{he scored}} his fourth century and earned Man of the Match award against New Zealand in Hyderabad, scoring 130 <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a 182 run {{partnership}} with Tendulkar, {{to lay the}} foundations for a 145 run victory. In spite of it, Sehwag struggled for consistency in 2003 and 2003/04 ODI series where he had only one century and 3 fifties, two against minnows – Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and one against Pakistan, in 22 matches.|$|E
25|$|He {{was third}} in both {{aggregates}} and averages {{on the tour}} of India and Pakistan in 1955-56, scoring 652 runs at 34.31. He played four Tests on the tour, making 37 and 50 not out in New Delhi, and 31 and 61 (his highest Test score) in Madras. He played his last Test against the touring West Indies in Dunedin later that season, making 3 and 17, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 61 for the first wicket with Bert Sutcliffe in the second innings. It was also his last first-class match.|$|E

25|$|She {{attended}} Lexington High School, {{where she}} was involved in the drama department, and attended Wesleyan University {{where she was}} a member of the Eclectic Society. She staged performances based on work by the Legendary Pink Dots, an early influence, and was involved in the Legendary Pink Dots electronic mailing list, Cloud Zero. She then formed the Shadowbox Collective, devoted to street theatre <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> theatrical shows (such as the 2002 play, Hotel Blanc, which she directed).

25|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} {{debut in the}} Gopalan Trophy match in 1965-66, and was selected to tour Pakistan in 1966-67 with the Ceylon team. He played in all five first-class matches on the tour, including the three unofficial Tests against Pakistan. Although primarily an opening bowler, he achieved more with the bat on the tour. In the first match against Pakistan, batting at number 11, he top-scored with 41 not {{out in the first}} innings, while in the second match he opened the batting, scoring 28 and 27 <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 44 and 67 for the opening partnerships with Fitzroy Crozier, another bowler.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{was given}} another {{chance in the}} tour of the West Indies, even being called up to the Test squad owing to the injury of Mark Butcher. Still he was only given a chance in the ODI team, but he made an impact even at his un-native number three {{position}} top scoring with 29 in a tense England win. Despite this he was omitted, after the second abandoned match, until the fifth ODI where he contributed only 10 but made up for it joint top scoring with skipper Michael Vaughan <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a good start in an ultimately losing match, making a great first international catch. He also contributed 66 to help win the final match, drawing the series.|$|E

The chief plans a trick for his benefit <b>and,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a mantle crown, sits down as though he were a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he sit beside him and orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, he rises to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.|$|E

She rapidly developed a sense of possession, hoarding objects to which she took a liking for reasons doctors did not know, and became extremely upset if someone touched or moved anything she collected. She took all kinds of items but particularly sought colorful plastic objects, which doctors speculated was due to these having been the items she had access to as a child, {{and she did not}} seem to care whether they were toys or ordinary containers but especially sought out beach pails. During {{the first few months of}} her stay, giving her one of these objects could bring her out of a tantrum.|$|E
