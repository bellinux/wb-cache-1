5|$|A crucial safety {{aspect of}} {{international}} airports is medical facilities and practices. In particular, controlling transmissible disease, such as SARS, is deemed important at international airports. While these standards are regulated by ICAO Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs) and WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), local authorities have considerable say {{in how they}} <b>are</b> <b>implemented.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other {{multiplayer}} Xbox 360 titles, Halo 3 uses {{a customized}} version of TrueSkill ranking system for its matchmaking on a per-playlist basis. A linear {{measure of a}} player's experience with the matchmade portion {{of the game and}} each particular playlist is also tracked (denoted as EXP). To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> within easy reach, such as avoid/feedback options on a player's service record, as well as voice chat mute straight from the in-game scoreboard. Like Halo 2, Halo 3 supports downloadable content and updates.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} decisions <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> by the Indian civil servants. The {{members of}} civil service serve at {{the pleasure of}} the President of India and Article 311 of the constitution protects them from politically motivated or vindictive action. Civil servants are employees of the Government of India or of the states; however, not all employees of the Government are civil servants. Civil servants in a personal capacity are paid from the Civil List. Senior civil servants may be called to account by Parliament.|$|E

5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E
5|$|The JMP Scripting Language (JSL) is an {{interpreted}} {{language for}} recreating analytic results and for automating or extending the functionality of JMP software. JSL {{was first introduced}} in JMP version 4 in 2000. JSL has a LISP-like syntax, structured {{as a series of}} expressions. All programming elements, including if-then statements and loops, <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> as JSL functions. Data tables, display elements and analyses are represented by objects in JSL that are manipulated with named messages. Users may write JSL scripts to perform analyses and visualizations not available in the point-and-click interface or to automate a series of commands, such as weekly reports. SAS, R, and Matlab code can also be executed using JSL.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{have worked}} to {{understand}} these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E
