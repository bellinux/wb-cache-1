5|$|The 1951 novel The Troubled <b>Air</b> <b>by</b> Irwin Shaw {{tells the}} story of the {{director}} of a (fictional) radio show, broadcast live at the time, who is given a deadline to investigate his cast for alleged links to communism.

5|$|Argon {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from <b>air</b> <b>by</b> fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the <b>air</b> <b>by</b> flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E

5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>by</b> recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|During the Voskhod 2 {{mission in}} March 1965, cosmonauts Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov could not {{completely}} seal the spacecraft hatch after Leonov's historic first walk in space. The spacecraft's environmental control system {{responded to the}} leaking <b>air</b> <b>by</b> adding more oxygen to the cabin, causing the concentration level to rise as high as 45%. The crew and ground controllers worried {{about the possibility of}} fire, remembering Bondarenko's death four years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{retained}} {{all of the}} noble gases that were present at its formation except helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid <b>air</b> <b>by</b> fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E
5000|$|On August 12, 2014, Crossroads {{announced}} that it would relaunch CTS as Yes TV on September 1, 2014. Describing the new brand as [...] "embracing positivity and approaching the world with an affirmative position", the re-launch coincided with the announcement that it had picked up several new secular reality and game shows for the 2014-15 season, including America's Funniest Home Videos (formerly <b>aired</b> <b>by</b> City), American Idol (formerly <b>aired</b> <b>by</b> CTV and CTV Two), Judge Judy, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune (both formerly <b>aired</b> most-recently <b>by</b> CHCH-DT), The Biggest Loser (formerly <b>aired</b> <b>by</b> City), and The X Factor UK.|$|R

5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the <b>air</b> <b>by</b> compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa {{a hard time}} at home, particularly since Homer is ready to host a barbecue, complete with roast pig. On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the <b>air</b> <b>by</b> a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thénard {{tried to}} {{decompose}} dephlogisticated muriatic acid <b>air</b> <b>by</b> reacting it with charcoal {{to release the}} free element muriaticum (and carbon dioxide). They did not succeed and published a report in which they considered the possibility that dephlogisticated muriatic acid air is an element, but were not convinced.|$|E

5|$|In Cairo, a {{standoff}} {{took place in}} front of the Egyptian Museum {{in the early morning hours}} with rocks and petrol bombs reportedly flying.

5|$|Neon {{comprises}} 1 part in 55,000 in the Earth's atmosphere, or 18.2 ppm {{by volume}} (this {{is about the}} same as the molecule or mole fraction), or 1 part in 79,000 of <b>air</b> <b>by</b> mass. It comprises a smaller fraction in the crust. It is industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquefied air.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the ball, Clemson's 44 pass {{attempts}} and 21 pass completions were the most allowed by Virginia Tech in any bowl game to that point. The Tigers outgained Virginia Tech through the <b>air</b> <b>by</b> almost 40 yards, and Clemson's two quarterbacks performed consistently throughout the game. Dantzler completed 15 of 32 passes for one touchdown and 180 yards, while Simmons completed six of 12 passes for 63 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. On the ground, Dantzler led all rushers with 18 carries for 81 yards. Clemson's No. 2 rusher was Zachery, who had five carries for 15 yards.|$|E

5|$|The Lights {{were banned}} from photographing all of Central America except Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia, {{as a safety}} measure against the {{gathering}} of strategic knowledge. They {{took advantage of the}} Peruvian government's allowal to take pictures in the <b>air</b> <b>by</b> capturing the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines. These were unable to distinguish from the surface, though further into the atmosphere the designs can range from simple patterns to hummingbirds and llamas.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the <b>air</b> <b>by</b> the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
