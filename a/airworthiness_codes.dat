50|$|The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) {{was created}} in 2003 and reached full {{functionality}} in 2008, and has since taken over most over the JAA functions. JAA Certification Specifications, formerly known as JARs, are recognised by EASA as an acceptable basis for showing compliance with their national <b>airworthiness</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|E
40|$|The use of Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) is {{becoming}} an increasingly routine activity in military theatres of operation, particularly for the oft-cited ‘dull, dangerous and dirty ’ missions. There is growing acceptance that UAS will find similar utility within the corresponding civilian missions and beyond. UAS technologies are maturing rapidly but the associated regulations to allow open access to civilian airspace are yet to be fully formulated. Current UK practice is therefore to allow UAS operation only in segregated airspace (airspace denied to all other potential users) or in non-segregated airspace but restricted to line-of-sight operations, below 400 ft only. There is therefore a growing {{need to develop a}} means by which UAS can operate alongside existing airspace users, in all classes of nonsegregated UK airspace. The University of Liverpool's Virtual engineering Centre, is developing tools and techniques that will allow both industry and regulators to establish a ‘design for certification ’ ethos within the supply chain where safety-critical software and hardware is required. The processes will include requirements capture and validation phases, as well as a means of testing and evaluating whole UAS/sub-system virtual prototypes, with a view to being able to demonstrate compliance with the relevant <b>airworthiness</b> <b>codes</b> as early as possible in the design cycle. r...|$|E
50|$|EASA Part-M {{consists}} of several subparts. The noteworthy subparts are F (Maintenance for aircraft below 5700 kg in non commercial environment), G (Continuing Airworthiness Management Organization = CAMO, coordinating the compliance of aircraft with maintenance program, airworthiness directives and service bulletins) - the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>code</b> {{is available on}} the EASA website (easa.europa.eu) in the regulations section.|$|R
