50|$|The plenum is {{the space}} between a {{suspended}} ceiling and the structural deck above it. Since most offices have such spaces, sound masking speakers are commonly added there. For open offices, uniformity of the sound masking in the inhabited area is important and is largely determined by the horizontal spacing of the masking speakers as described above. Speaker arrays are generally rectangular. They generally face upwards to reflect sound from the deck and broaden {{the distribution of the}} sound to create a more uniform sound field. The diagram on the right shows an example. For closed offices, uniformity of sound level is not an issue. Generally, ceiling tiles with a high transmission loss are recommended, those with CAC (Ceiling <b>Attenuation</b> <b>Class)</b> ratings of 30 or greater. This reduces the impact of sound masking in adjacent open areas which would have excessive levels in those offices. Typically the ceiling plenum is used as a return air duct requiring an open grill. Sound masking in the plenum above a closed office can generate excessive levels. There are simple metal covers that are placed above the grille to reduce the impact of the hole. Available ones are sufficiently large so do not impede air flow. The upper figure n the left shows a masking speaker that mounts directly on the ceiling tile grid. The two lower figures are examples of speakers that are hung in the ceiling plenum. If the ceiling plenum is shallow, a low profile speaker is required. This speaker radiates sound horizontally rather than vertically to improve the uniformity of the masking in the occupied area below. An example is shown in the lower left figure.|$|E

Proteolysis {{is required in}} this process both for degradation of invariant chain (Ii) from class II-Ii complexes to allow subsequent binding of peptides, and for generation of the antigenic peptides. The cysteine endoprotease, cathepsin S, mediates Ii degradation in human and mouse antigen-presenting cells. Studies described here examine the functional significance of cathepsin S inhibition on antigen presentation and immunity. Specific inhibition of cathepsin S in A 20 cells markedly impaired presentation of an ovalbumin epitope by interfering with class II-peptide binding, not by obstructing generation of the antigen. Administration of a cathepsin S inhibitor to mice in vivo selectively inhibited activity of cathepsin S in splenocytes, resulting in accumulation of a class II-associated Ii breakdown product, <b>attenuation</b> of <b>class</b> II-peptide complex formation, and inhibition of antigen presentation.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{stability and}} impulsive noise disturbance <b>attenuation</b> in a <b>class</b> of joint process driven and networked hybrid systems with coupling delays (JPDNHSwD) has been investigated. In particular, {{there are two}} separable processes monitoring the networked hybrid systems.

Continuous dynamics and control laws in networked subsystems and couplings among subsystems change as events occur stochastically in a spatio-temporal fashion. When an event occurs, the continuous state variables may jump from one value to another. Using the stochastic Lyapunov functional approach, sufficient conditions {{on the existence of}} a remote time-delay feedback controller which ensures stochastic stability for this class of JPDNHSwD are obtained. The derived conditions are expressed in terms of solutions of LMIs.

40|$|Abstract. High-power {{applications}} of rf often {{require the use}} of overmoded waveguide to reduce the probability of rf breakdown by lowering surface fields, as well as to reduce the attenuation due to ohmic losses in transporting the power from the point of generation to the point of use. This is particularly true in the development of warm linear collider designs, such as NLC, JLC, and CLIC, especially the former two which involve extensive rf pulse compression / power distribution systems. Transitioning to and from overmoded waveguide and manipulating rf in such systems requires specialized components in whose design care must be taken to avoid parasitic mode loss and excessive field enhancement. Although fixed frequency operation means modest bandwidth requirements, power levels up to several hundred megawatts must be accommodated, and efficiency is important. Consequently, physicists working at laboratories engaged in the above efforts have produced a number of novel waveguide components in the past several years. These include tapers, mode converters, bends, directional couplers, power splitter/combiners, switches, phase shifters, etc. Often the circular TE 01 mode is used for its lack of surface electric field and low <b>attenuation.</b> A <b>class</b> of components using planar geometries for over-height rectangular waveguide has been developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

40|$|Abstract — The authors {{develop a}} {{systematic}} procedure for obtaining robust adaptive controllers that achieve asymptotic tracking and disturbance <b>attenuation</b> for a <b>class</b> of nonlinear {{systems that are}} described in the parametric strict-feedback form and are subject to additional exogenous disturbance inputs. Their approach to adaptive control is performance-based, where the objective for the controller design {{is not only to}} find an adaptive controller, but also to construct an appropriate cost functional, compatible with desired asymptotic tracking and disturbance attenuation specifications, with respect to which the adaptive controller is “worst case optimal. ” In this respect, they also depart from the standard worst case (robust) controller design paradigm where the performance index is fixed priori. Three main ingredients of the paper are the backstepping methodology, worst case identification schemes, and singular perturbations analysis. Under full state measurements, closedform expressions have been obtained for an adaptive controller and the corresponding value function, where the latter satisfies a Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation (or inequality) associated with the underlying cost function, thereby leading to satisfaction of a dissipation inequality for the former. An important by-product of the analysis is the finding that the adaptive controllers that meet the dual specifications of asymptotic tracking and disturbance attenuation are generally not certainty-equivalent, but are asymptotically so as the measure quantifying the designer’s confidence in the parameter estimate goes to infinity. To illustrate the main results, the authors include a numerical example involving a third-order system.

However, the lack of well-established methodology for MR-based attenuation correction is hampering further development and wider acceptance of this technology. We {{assess the impact of}} ignoring bone attenuation and using different tissue classes for generation of the attenuation map on the accuracy of attenuation correction of PET data. This work was performed using simulation studies based on the XCAT phantom and clinical input data. For the latter, PET and CT images of patients were used as input for the analytic simulation model using realistic activity distributions where CT-based attenuation correction was utilized as reference for comparison. For both phantom and clinical studies, the reference attenuation map was classified into various numbers of tissue classes to produce three (air, soft tissue and lung), four (air, lungs, soft tissue and cortical bones) and five (air, lungs, soft tissue, cortical bones and spongeous bones) <b>class</b> <b>attenuation</b> maps. The phantom studies demonstrated that ignoring bone increases the relative error by up to 6. 8 % in the body and up to 31. 0 % for bony regions. Likewise, the simulated clinical studies showed that the mean relative error reached 15 % for lesions located in the body and 30. 7 % for lesions located in bones, when neglecting bones. These results demonstrate an underestimation of about 30 % of tracer uptake when neglecting bone, which in turn imposes substantial loss of quantitative accuracy for PET images produced by hybrid PET/MRI systems. Considering bones in the attenuation map will considerably improve the accuracy of MR-guided attenuation correction in hybrid PET/MR to enable quantitative PET imaging on hybrid PET/MR technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|For a {{collection}} of distributions over a countable support set, the worst case universal compression formulation by Shtarkov attempts to assign a universal distribution over the support set. The formulation aims {{to ensure that the}} universal distribution does not underestimate the probability of any element in the support set relative to distributions in the collection. When the alphabet is uncountable and we have {{a collection}} P of Lebesgue continuous measures instead, we ask if there is a corresponding universal probability density function (pdf) that does not underestimate the value of the density function at any point in the support relative to pdfs in P. Analogous to the worst case redundancy of {{a collection of}} distributions over a countable alphabet, we define the <b>attenuation</b> of a <b>class</b> to be A when the worst case optimal universal pdf at any point x in the support is always at least the value any pdf in the collection P assigns to x divided by A.

We show that this attenuation is finite, grows with the number of samples as O(n), and also specify the attentuation exactly without approximations. When only one parameter is allowed to vary, we show that the attenuation grows as O(√(n)), again keeping in line with results from prior literature that fix the order of magnitude as a factor of √(n) per parameter. In addition, we also specify the attenuation exactly without approximation when only the mean or only the variance is allowed to vary...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{exclusive}} features for hybrid PET/MRI systems {{in comparison with}} its PET/CT counterpart in terms of reduction of radiation exposure, improved soft-tissue contrast and truly simultaneous and multi-parametric imaging capabilities. However, quantitative imaging on PET/MR is challenged by attenuation of annihilation photons through their pathway. The correction for photon attenuation requires the availability of patient-specific attenuation map, which accounts for the spatial distribution of attenuation coefficients of biological tissues. However, {{the lack of information}} on electron density in the MR signal poses an inherent difficulty to the derivation of the attenuation map from MR images. In other words, the MR signal correlates with proton densities and tissue relaxation properties, rather than with electron density and, as such, it is not directly related to attenuation coefficients. In order to derive the attenuation map from MR images at 511 keV, various strategies have been proposed and implemented on prototype and commercial PET/MR systems. Segmentation based methods generate an attenuation map by classification of T 1 -weighted or high resolution Dixon MR sequences followed by assignment of predefined attenuation coefficients to various tissue types. Intensity based segmentation approaches fail to include bones in the attenuation map since the segmentation of bones from conventional MR sequences is a difficult task. Most MR-guided attenuation correction techniques ignore bones owing to the inherent difficulties associated with bone segmentation unless specialized MR sequences such as ultra short echo (UTE) sequence are utilized. In this work, we introduce a new technique based on statistical shape modeling to segment bones and generate a four <b>class</b> <b>attenuation</b> map. Our segmentation approach requires a torso bone shape model based on principle component analysis (PCA). A CT-based training set including clearly segmented bones of the torso region of 20 clinical studies was designed. Using this training set, a bone atlas was trained taking advantage of PCA analysis. Our active shape segmentation technique uses the trained shape model to segment bones from user defined initial seed points. The segmentation algorithm was evaluated using 10 clinical datasets (aligned MR and CT pairs). The resulting attenuation maps were compared to corresponding attenuation maps derived from CT resulting in a mean relative difference less than 7 %. (C) 2013 Elsevier EN. All rights reserve...|$|R
