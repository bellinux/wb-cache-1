5000|$|George’s son Robert N. Hartzell owned a small {{airplane}} and did maintenance {{as a young}} man.

2500|$|And yet, [...] "synchronization", in {{the usual}} sense of the word, between the rate of fire of a machine gun (firing as such, in a fully {{automatic}} manner) and the revolutions per minute of a spinning <b>aircraft</b> <b>propeller</b> is also a conceptual impossibility. A machine gun normally fires at a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by (for instance) strengthening and increasing the tension on a return spring, or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating. The propeller of an aircraft, on the other hand, turns at widely differing rates of revolution per minute, depending on the throttle setting, and whether the aircraft is climbing, flying level, or diving. Even if it were feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine's tachometer at which a machine gun's cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller – this would be very limiting.|$|E
