The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate our real-world experience regarding the efficacy of intravenous AD in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at our university hospital. In this retrospective study, we enrolled and divided 644 patients into <b>AD</b> (<b>AD</b> <b>administration</b> before arrival at the hospital) and non-AD (no <b>AD</b> <b>administration</b> before arrival at the hospital) groups. The patient characteristics including age, sex, percentage of cardiac cause, location of cardiac arrest, and witnessed arrest were similar between the AD and non-AD groups. There were no significant differences between the AD and non-AD groups with regard to return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, or good neurologic recovery at hospital discharge in all patients. In addition, we excluded the data of patients with extrinsic cause. We analyzed whether intravenous AD before arrival in patients with intrinsic cause was effective. The outcomes in the AD group were similar to those in the non-AD group. In conclusion, our study indicated that <b>AD</b> <b>administration</b> before arrival at the hospital for the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest did not improve the clinical outcome...|$|R

30|$|Previously, the late-term {{effect of}} AD on the uptake of [18 F]FDG and [11 C]choline has been characterised in hormone-dependent and hormone-independent PCa {{xenograft}} models [20]. The authors demonstrated the lower efficacy of [11 C]choline PET {{compared to that}} of [18 F]FDG PET for tumour detection and therapy response assessment in vivo after surgical castration. Likewise, in this study, not only the trapping of [11 C]choline, but also of [11 C]acetate in the xenografted tumours was lower than that of [18 F]FDG; however, the clinical relevance of [11 C]choline and [11 C]acetate and their superiority to [18 F]FDG for PCa detection have been shown. In the current study, we focussed on evaluating the effect of intratumoural response to AD on PET imaging with both these tracers as well as with [18 F]FDG [5]. Moreover, in order to minimise partial volume effects in imaging assessment, the xenografted tumours had to have a minimal volume of 150 mm 3. However, at this point, the proliferation rate of 22 Rv 1 tumours was rather fast, wherefore long observation periods after AD were not possible. Kukuk et al. evaluated the effect of AD on tracer uptake 2 and 3 weeks following castration [20], which would reflect follow-up imaging of treated PCa in a clinical setting more precisely. However, Oyama et al. demonstrated at an early stage androgen-regulated effects on metabolic PET imaging in androgen-sensitive PCa [18]. In this study, PCa xenografted tumours were androgen-deprived for 1 week by means of diethylstilbestrol (DES) <b>administration.</b> <b>AD</b> significantly diminished the uptake of [18 F]FDG, but not [11 C]acetate in androgen-sensitive PCa [18]. Taken these findings into account and the fact that androgen-induced effects on gene expression were previously observed in preclinical models after several days [21, 22], we investigated the short-term effect of AD, i.e. 5 days following the start of the treatment, on metabolic PET imaging of PCa xenografted tumours.|$|R

Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Neolithic Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111-771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan.

40|$|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by deposition of ß-amyloid (Aß) peptides as plaques in the brain. Central to this AD pathology is mismetabolism of the {{amyloid precursor protein}} (APP). Recent studies suggest that flavonoids, a class of secondary plant metabolites, may be useful for the prevention and treatment {{of a variety of}} neurodegenerative diseases. The studies detailed herein, investigate the ability of two such classes of flavonoids, green tea derived catechins and 5, 7 -dihydroxyflavones, to modulate APP metabolism in 2 ̆ 2 Swedish 2 ̆ 2 mutant APP (APP[subscript]sw) models of AD. Studies showed that green tea derived (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) effectively reduced Aß generation and resultant amyloidosis both in vitro and in vivo. In concert with these findings, EGCG markedly promoted non-amyloidogenic APP proteolysis via activation of the putative a-secretase, a-disintegrin-and-metalloprotease- 10 (ADAM 10). Furthermore, luteolin and various related 5, 7 -dihydroxyflavones, effectively reduced Aß generation and resultant amyloidosis both in vitro and in vivo, as well. Data revealed that luteolin decreased amyloidogenic ?-secretase APP proteolysis via presenilin- 1 (PS 1) carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) phosphorylation.

When exposed to chronic ADs or wheel-running, no increase in proliferation or neurogenesis is observed. Ablation of TrkB also renders these mice behaviorally insensitive to antidepressive treatment in depression- and anxiety-like paradigms. In contrast, mice lacking TrkB only in differentiated DG neurons display typical neurogenesis and respond normally to chronic ADs. Thus, our data establish an essential cell-autonomous role for TrkB in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral sensitivity to antidepressive treatments, and support the notion that impairment of the neurogenic niche is an etiological factor for refractory responses to an antidepressive regimen...|$|R

Methods and Results—Human coronary artery endothelial cells were challenged in vitro with microbial components that stimulate NLRs or Toll-like receptors. We found stimulatory effects of NLR and Toll-like receptor ligands on the adhesion molecule expression and cytokine secretion by human coronary artery endothelial cells. On the basis of these results, we examined the in vivo effects of these ligands in mice. Among them, FK 565, 1 of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod) - 1 ligands induced strong site-specific inflammation in the aortic root. Furthermore, coronary arteritis/valvulitis developed after direct oral <b>administration</b> or <b>ad</b> libitum drinking of FK 565. The degree of the respective vascular inflammation was associated with persistent high expression of proinflammatory chemokine/ cytokine and matrix metallopeptidase (Mmp) genes in each tissue in vivo by microarray analysis.
