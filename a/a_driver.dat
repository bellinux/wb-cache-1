50|$|<b>A</b> <b>driver's</b> permit, learner's permit, learner's license or {{provisional}} license, is {{a restricted}} license that {{is given to}} a person who is learning to drive, but has not yet satisfied the requirement to obtain <b>a</b> <b>driver's</b> license. Having <b>a</b> <b>driver's</b> permit for <b>a</b> certain length of time is usually one of the requirements (along with <b>driver's</b> education and <b>a</b> road test) for applying for <b>a</b> full <b>driver's</b> license.

40|$|This survey {{examined}} why {{a substantial}} percentage {{of young adults}} currently do not have <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license, and the future plans of this group concerning obtaining a license. The survey yielded useable responses from 618 persons aged 18 to 39 without <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license. The top eight reasons (primary or secondary) for not having <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license were as follows: (1) too busy or {{not enough time to}} get <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license (37 %), (2) owning and maintaining a vehicle is too expensive (32 %), (3) able to get transportation from others (31 %), (4) prefer to bike or walk (22 %), (5) prefer to use public transportation (17 %), (6) concerned about how driving impacts the environment (9 %), (7) able to communicate and/or conduct business online instead (8 %), and (8) disability/medical/vision problems (7 %). Of the respondents, 22 % indicated that they plan on never getting <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license. On the other hand, 69 % expect to get <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license within the next five years. Young adults without <b>a</b> <b>driver’s</b> license—in comparison with the general population of the same age—tend to have less education and higher unemployment. However, the present study was not designed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship, or the direction of the effect if there were such a relationship...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> in the hull and a gunner and {{commander in the}} turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E

5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books.
