25|$|At {{the end of}} 1936, Milius {{moved to}} Chicago with her first husband, Daniel House, whom she married in 1935. House began law school at the University of Chicago and Milius settled into {{activities}} with the Chicago branch of the <b>Artists</b> <b>Union.</b> She befriended Mitchell Siporin, Morris Topchevsky, and Adrian Troy, joining them in their ongoing dispute against the Illinois Art Project (IAP). IAP became a target after issues with dismissals, subject matter censoring, {{and the rights of}} the artists to organize. On December 12, 1936, 27 representatives from the Illinois Workers Alliance, the Technical and Research Employees Union, the Adult Teachers' Union and the <b>Artists</b> <b>Union,</b> occupied the IAP headquarters in a sitdown strike. Milius participated in the eight-day sitdown, and her drawings of the event were published in the Chicago Daily News and New Masses.|$|E

500|$|As {{reported}} in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the première (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen's work Fresco for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) {{was the scene of}} a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as [...] "glissandos no faster than one octave per minute" [...] and others phoning the <b>artists</b> <b>union</b> to clarify whether they really had to perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: [...] "We're playing, otherwise we would be [...] ". During the première the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like [...] "Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don't feed", that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: [...] "How can you possibly participate in such crap?" [...] ("Wie könnt ihr bloß so eine Scheiße machen!"). At one point someone managed to switch off the stand lights, leaving the musicians in the dark. After 260 minutes the performance ended with nobody participating any more [...]|$|E

2500|$|After {{she quit}} the <b>Artists</b> <b>Union,</b> {{she joined the}} American Abstract Artists. This {{marks the end of}} her {{educational}} career. While she was a member, she typically exhibited cubist still lifes in a black-gridded cloisonne style which were highly impastoed and [...] gestural. She met future abstract expressionists Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, and Bradley Walker Tomlin through this organization. She lost interest in their usage of hard-edge geometric style after her relationship with Pollock began.|$|E
2500|$|Disappointed with Grosz's lack of {{political}} energy, Milius began training under printmaker Harry Sternberg, who she described as a [...] "spirited leftist". Sternberg {{was a member of}} the John Reed Club, and his Marxist beliefs began to influence Milius and her fellow students including Rita Albers, Julien Alberts, Mary Annand, Hugh Miller. Encouraged by Sternberg, the students joined the <b>Artists</b> <b>Union</b> in New York. Milius exhibited her art in union shows, and was one of hundreds who participated in the Rockefeller vandalism protests, which protested the destruction of Diego Rivera's Man at the Crossroads painting. With her political and artistic friends, she frequently visited the New York Public Library print collections, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and New York art galleries.|$|E
2500|$|It {{eventually}} became {{too difficult for}} Krasner to support herself as a waitress due to the Great Depression. In order to provide for herself, she joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in 1935. She worked on the mural division {{as an assistant to}} Max Spivak. Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public murals. Since murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable for murals. While Krasner was happy to have a job, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with [...] figurative images created by other artists. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an [...] abstract mural. As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WYNC radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into [...] War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda. She continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan.> She was very involved with the <b>Artists</b> <b>Union</b> during her employment with the WPA but {{was one of the first}} to quit the organization when she realized the communists were taking it over. By being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in New York City and enlarge her network.|$|E
