40|$|Abstract. Indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) were prepared by a coprecipitation process from a mixed solution consisting of indium chloride and tin chloride. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption was studied under different calcinate atmospheres. The {{characteristics of the}} optical properties, especially the absorption of near-infrared (NIR) region was recorded by the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The {{results show that the}} SPR absorption peak appears at 2500 nm under <b>an</b> oxidizing <b>atmosphere</b> (air) or at 1300 nm under <b>a</b> reducing <b>atmosphere</b> (<b>a</b> gas mixture of Ar and 5 vol % H 2) when calcinated under <b>a</b> single <b>atmosphere.</b> There is no change in the plasmon frequency with the variance of calcinate temperatures and therefore no change in the free carrier concentration. However, when calcinated first at 600 ℃ under <b>an</b> oxidizing <b>atmosphere</b> and then reheated under <b>a</b> reducing <b>atmosphere</b> at different temperature, the SPR absorption peaks of the ITO NPs are at the range of from 1200 nm to 1430 nm, undergoing a blue shift as the reducing process temperature increases. The SPR absorption of the prepared ITO NPs is easily controlled by calcinate temperature under a process of calcination first under <b>an</b> oxidizing <b>atmosphere</b> and followed by under <b>a</b> reducing <b>atmosphere...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of an off-axis Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam in <b>a</b> turbulent <b>atmosphere</b> is investigated {{based on the}} extended Huygens-Fresnel integral formula. Analytical formulae for the cross-spectral density and corresponding partially coherent complex curvature tensor of an off-axis GSM beam propagating in <b>a</b> turbulent <b>atmosphere</b> are derived.

Furthermore, the methods are extended to investigate the propagation properties of a partially coherent laser array beam in <b>a</b> turbulent <b>atmosphere.</b> The properties of an off-axis GSM beam and a partially coherent laser array beam in <b>a</b> turbulent <b>atmosphere</b> are closely related with the beam parameters and the structure constant of the turbulent atmosphere.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for growing an epitaxial STO film is the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [16, 17]. In order to grow layers of oxides with suitable stoichiometry, <b>an</b> oxidizing <b>atmosphere</b> with <b>an</b> oxygen pressure (pO 2) above 10 − 4  mbar is required [12]. When STO is deposited on semiconductor or metallic substrates, the growth at high temperature under <b>an</b> oxygen <b>atmosphere</b> can produce the oxidation of the substrate surface. To avoid the undesirable oxidation of metal surface that can inhibit epitaxial growth of the STO film, only a few authors have reported the usage of <b>a</b> reducing <b>atmosphere</b> in the case of growth of CeO 2 and STO layers on Ni alloys by PLD at high temperature [14, 18]. They proposed a two-step growing process at high temperatures: a first step in <b>a</b> reducing <b>atmosphere</b> until tens of nanometers of thickness and a second step in <b>an</b> oxidizing <b>atmosphere</b> to the final thickness [14, 18].|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
