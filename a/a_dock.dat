5|$|Apple {{offers several}} iPad accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack. <b>A</b> <b>dock</b> holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has <b>a</b> <b>dock</b> connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. <b>A</b> <b>dock</b> that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.|$|E

25|$|To perform <b>a</b> <b>docking</b> screen, {{the first}} {{requirement}} is {{a structure of}} the protein of interest. Usually the structure has been determined using a biophysical technique such as x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, but can also derive from homology modeling construction. This protein structure and a database of potential ligands serve as inputs to <b>a</b> <b>docking</b> program. The success of <b>a</b> <b>docking</b> program depends on two components: the search algorithm and the scoring function.|$|R

5|$|Thomas {{proposed}} building <b>a</b> <b>dock</b> {{accessed by}} the railway for export of coal, iron and limestone, and import of hay, grain and vegetables for the mining districts. The idea was also attractive to railway developers of the period. The Ogmore Valley Railway Company wanted to increase revenue by carrying coal for shipment to the docks at Cardiff and Penarth. H. Voss, the engineer of the Ely Valley Railway Company and the Great Western Railway, also saw its commercial potential, {{and made a}} proposal to Jenner of Wenvoe Castle to build <b>a</b> <b>dock</b> at Barry, {{the largest in the}} district, which would be connected by rail to Peterston-super-Ely on the main South Wales line.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{introduction}} of the BVW-200 camera though, the camera and recorder configuration was <b>a</b> <b>docking</b> system. The BVW-200 was an integrated camera recorder system. It sacrificed the flexibility of <b>a</b> <b>docking</b> camera in order to lose a substantial amount of weight. Eventually, non-docking camcorders became the most popular design by the mid-1990s.|$|R

5|$|After {{the two new}} dreadnoughts {{were awarded}} to Fore River, Moreno was {{subcontracted}} out to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey as {{called for in the}} final contract. Morenos keel was laid on 9 July 1910, and construction was overseen by the Argentine Naval Commission. After the completion of the hull, it was launched on 23 September 1911. Isabel Betbeder, wife to the chief of the Argentine Naval Commission, sponsored Moreno. The ship was then moored to <b>a</b> <b>dock</b> to commence fitting-out, which was finished on 15 February 1915. It was commissioned into the Argentine Navy nine days later.|$|E

5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from <b>a</b> <b>dock</b> to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E

Online, riders may purchase passes for a month ($28) or a year ($85 if paid in one lump; $96 if paid in monthly increments of $8); these riders are mailed an RFID key that can unlock bikes without a code.|$|E

5|$|In rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands {{tribes in}} the Americas, {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) and yellow root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima) provide a rich yellow color. Chitimacha basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow that employs <b>a</b> <b>dock</b> plant (most likely Rumex crispus) for yellow. Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake-weed, brown onion skins, and rubber plant (Parthenium incanum). Rabbitbush (Chrysothamnus) and rose hips produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.|$|E
