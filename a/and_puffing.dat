5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing <b>and</b> <b>puffing</b> when approached.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up <b>and</b> <b>puffing</b> on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K <b>and</b> <b>puffing</b> {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their common}} name, this genus is active during the day, {{as well as}} at night. When disturbed, they will engage in a ferocious hissing <b>and</b> <b>puffing</b> threat display. They may lift the first part of their bodies off the ground in a coil and make a {{powerful}} swiping strike; juveniles have been known to come off the ground. Others specimens may raise the first part of their bodies off the ground, flattening their necks and moving forward, tongue extended, like a small cobra. The rather frantic strikes are often combined with attempts to quickly glide away.|$|E
25|$|I have had, in {{the last}} four years, the advantage, if it be an advantage, of many strange and varied experiences, from which the student of realities might draw profit and instruction. But nothing was so thrilling as this: to wait and {{struggle}} among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells and the artillery, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting <b>and</b> <b>puffing</b> of the engine—poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all—the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realisation of powerlessness, and the alternations of hope and despair—all this for seventy minutes by the clock with only four inches of twisted iron work to make the difference between danger, captivity, and shame on the one hand—safety, freedom, and triumph on the other.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} St. Louis Cardinals {{began a series}} of games against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, in 1963, the Los Angeles Times {{published}} a large cartoon, drawn by artist Pete Bentovoja, modeled on the movies about the German submarine captain. The captain is Cards' manager Johnny Keane; his [...] "lieutenant" [...] is Stan Musial. They wear Cardinal uniforms with naval officers' caps bearing the [...] "St.L" [...] emblem. While Keane and Musial are speaking, other crew members load bats, like torpedoes, into torpedo tubes; the bats have players' faces (and names and batting averages) drawn on them. Keane looks through the periscope; the inset shows a battleship with a large head of O'Malley, wearing a naval officers cap bearing the [...] "LA" [...] emblem <b>and</b> <b>puffing</b> a cigar.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} hydrate {{production}} named "Five-spot thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> (HP- 5 S) '' is designed and employed {{to investigate the}} behaviors of hydrate dissociation in the Cubic Hydrate Simulator (CHS). This method uses the thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> method in a five-spot well system. In addition, the experiments with the methods of the five-spot thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> in conjunction with depressurization (HP- 5 S-D), the heat stimulation with a five-spot well (HS- 5 S), the heat stimulation in conjunction with depressurization with a five-spot well (HS- 5 S-D), the thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> (HP), <b>and</b> the huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> in conjunction with depressurization (HP-D), are also carried out in this work. The energy efficiencies, thermal efficiencies, gas recoveries, and average gas production rates are used to evaluate these production methods. The analysis of hydrate decomposition shows that the thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> method in a five-spot well system is superior {{to that in a}} single vertical well on the aspects of the energy efficiency, thermal efficiency, gas recovery, and average gas production rate. The HP- 5 S-D method, which can obtain the highest gas recovery, thermal efficiency, and energy efficiency, is the optimal method for hydrate production in this work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|With {{superheated}} steam {{there is no}} direct relationship between temperature and pressure, and it can exist at a wide range of temperatures. Superheated steam with high degree(> 50 °C) of superheat has similar thermal physical characteristics with ideal gas and the heat transfer coefficient is 1 / 150 - 1 / 250 as much as that of saturated steam during heat transferring. It could release less energy and transmitted longer distances than that of saturated steam in heavy oil reservoirs. Numerical simulation shows that under the condition of carrying the same heat, {{superheated steam}} huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> enlarged the heating radius by about 10 m, oil production increment by 1463 t, oil steam ratio increase by 0. 7. Superheated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> was put into Kazakstan’s heavy oil reservoir after saturated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> <b>and</b> the average daily oil production was 2 - 4 times that of saturated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff,</b> which improved heavy oil production effectively. The secondary heavy oil thermal recovery by superheated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> applicated in marginal heavy oil reservoirs achieved satisfactory effect.
