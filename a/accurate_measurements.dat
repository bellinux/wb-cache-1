5|$|Pallas {{has been}} {{observed}} occulting stars several times, including the best observed of all asteroid occultation events on 29 May 1983, when careful occultation timing measurements were taken by 140 observers. These resulted in the first <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> of its diameter.|$|E
5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements,</b> Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements.</b> As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} devices {{used to measure}} and {{regulate}} humidity. Calibration standards for the most <b>accurate</b> <b>measurement</b> include the gravimetric hygrometer, chilled mirror hygrometer, and electrolytic hygrometer. The gravimetric method, while the most accurate, is very cumbersome. For fast and very <b>accurate</b> <b>measurement</b> the chilled mirror method is effective.|$|R

5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements.</b>|$|E
5|$|Significant {{progress}} in Big Bang cosmology {{has been made}} since the late 1990s {{as a result of}} advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that {{the expansion of the universe}} appears to be accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, it was not known whether light {{travelled}} instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation {{of the speed of}} light. Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements.</b>|$|E

Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers {{do not seem to}} be very different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant.|$|E
5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> with extreme accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{measured}} deposition temperature {{indicated that}} hassium(VIII) oxide is less volatile than osmium tetroxide, OsO4, and places hassium firmly in group 8. However, the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO4 measured, (−46 ± 2) kJ/mol, {{was significantly lower}} than what was predicted, (−36.7 ± 1.5) kJ/mol, indicating that OsO4 was more volatile than HsO4, contradicting earlier calculations, which implied {{that they should have}} very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO4 is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol. It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals (silicon nitride and silicon dioxide) used for the detector; further research is required, including more <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4.|$|E

5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more <b>accurate</b> <b>measurements</b> made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
