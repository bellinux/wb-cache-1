5000|$|C {{supports}} {{the use of}} pointers, a type of reference that records the <b>address</b> <b>or</b> <b>location</b> of an object or function in memory. Pointers can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function. Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or pointer arithmetic. The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer's type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time. Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled {{by the size of}} the pointed-to data type. Pointers are used for many purposes in C. Text strings are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays of characters. Dynamic memory allocation is performed using pointers. Many data types, such as trees, are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated [...] objects linked together using pointers. Pointers to functions are useful for passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions (such as qsort or bsearch) or as callbacks to be invoked by event handlers.|$|E

Also, each node only needs to store {{the number of times}} it has been visited. Thus, EZ-AG is lightweight in terms of both communication requirements and memory utilization. It also makes rather minimal assumptions of the underlying network. In particular, it does not assume knowledge of node <b>addresses</b> <b>or</b> <b>locations,</b> require a neighborhood discovery service or network topology information, or depend upon any particular routing or transport protocols such as TCP/IP.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the early}} works in crime {{analysis}} aimed to identify hotspots of crime within big regions. These regions could extend as large as states, counties, a group of counties, cities, neighborhoods and police beats. The aim of this approach was to focus on large areas, rather than specific <b>addresses</b> <b>or</b> <b>locations</b> hosting crime events {{as part of a}} larger environment. This is important because not all locations are equal generators of crime and not all provide equal opportunity for offenders to conduct criminal activity. Thus, crime concentrations are smaller groups of crime uniformly or randomly distributed within a hotspot’s geographical domain; this is because not all hotspots have the same crime composition and patterns. In other words, a hotspot can be composed by multiple layers of crime intensity. Thus, each one has its own variations or rhythms of crime distribution. Therefore, it is each hotspot’s composition that dictates what measures need to be employed as crime reduction strategies.|$|R

40|$|MobilityFirst is {{a future}} Internet {{architecture}} with mobility and trustworthiness as central design goals. Mobility {{means that all}} endpoints { devices, services, content, and networks { {{should be able to}} frequently change network attachment points in a seamless manner. Trustworthiness means that the network must be resilient to the presence of a small num-ber of malicious endpoints or network routers. MobilityFirst enhances mobility by cleanly separating names <b>or</b> identiers from <b>addresses</b> <b>or</b> network <b>locations,</b> and enhances secu-rity by representing both in an intrinsically veriable man-ner, relying upon a massively scalable, distributed, global name service to bind names and addresses, and to facilitate services including device-to-service, multicast, anycast, and context-aware communication, content retrieval, and more. A key insight emerging from our experience is that a log-ically centralized global name service can signicantly en-hance mobility and security and transform network-layer functionality. Recognizing and validating this insight is the key contribution of the MobilityFirst architectural effort...|$|R
40|$|Attacks against Internet routing are {{increasing}} {{in number and}} severity. Contributing greatly to these attacks {{is the absence of}} origin authentication: {{there is no way to}} validate claims of <b>address</b> ownership <b>or</b> <b>location.</b> The lack of such services enables not only attacks by malicious entities, but indirectly allow seemingly inconsequential miconfigurations to disrupt large portions of the Internet. This paper considers the semantics, design, and costs of origin authentication in interdomain routing. We formalize the semantics of address delegation and use on the Internet, and develop and characterize broad classes of origin authentication proof systems. We estimate the address delegation graph representing the current use of IPv 4 address space using available routing data. This effort reveals that current address delegation is dense and relatively static: as few as 16 entities perform 80 % of the delegation on the Internet. We conclude by evaluating the proposed services via traced based simulation. Our simulation shows the enhanced proof systems can reduce significantly reduce resource costs associated with origin authentication...|$|R
40|$|Hashing or scatter table storage [3] {{is a very}} {{efficient}} data structure for the dictionary (insert, delete, member) problem. The load factor ff of a table {{is defined as the}} ratio of the number n of records or elements in the table divided by the number m of records the table can hold. The advantage of hashing schemes is that if ff ! 1, the cost of performing any of the dictionary operations can be bounded by a function of ff, the load factor, independent of the values of n and m. This compares favorably with tree-like structures and other key comparison based schemes where the cost of the dictionary operations is ΩΓ/ 17 n). The idea of hashing is to obtain a memory <b>address</b> <b>or</b> table <b>location</b> where an element is stored by applying a function (hash function) to the key of the record. The candidate location provided by the hash function is not affected by {{the presence or absence of}} any other key values in the table. When two elements hash to the same tabl [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Location based social {{networking}} (LBSN) applications {{are part of}} a new suite of emerging {{social networking}} tools that run on the Web 2. 0 platform. LBSN is the convergence between location based services (LBS) and online social networking (OSN). LBSN applications offer users the ability to look up the location of another 2 ̆ 2 friend 2 ̆ 2 remotely using a smart phone, desktop or other device, anytime and anywhere. Users invite their friends to participate in LBSN and there is a process of consent that follows. Friends have the ability to alter their privacy settings to allow their location to be monitored by another at differing levels of accuracy (e. g. suburb, pinpoint at the street <b>address</b> level, <b>or</b> manual <b>location</b> entry). This paper explores the impact of LBSN upon society, especially upon trust between friends. The study used focus groups to collect data, and a qualitative approach towards analysis. The paper concludes that while there are a great many positive uses of LBSN, there are some significant problems with current applications, and that better design is required to ensure that these technologies are not exploited against a user to commit harm...|$|R

40|$|Spatial cluster {{analysis}} is a uniquely interdisciplinary endeavour, {{and so it}} is important to communicate and disseminate ideas, innovations, best practices and challenges across practitioners, applied epidemiology researchers and spatial statisticians. In this research we conducted a scoping review to systematically search peer-reviewed journal databases for research that has employed spatial {{cluster analysis}} methods on individual-level, <b>address</b> <b>location,</b> <b>or</b> x and y coordinate derived data. To illustrate the thematic issues raised by our results, methods were tested using a dataset where known clusters existed. Point pattern methods, spatial clustering and cluster detection tests, and a locally weighted spatial regression model were most commonly used for individual-level, address location data (n = 29). The spatial scan statistic was the most popular method for address location data (n = 19). Six themes were identified relating to the application of spatial cluster analysis methods and subsequent analyses, which we recommend researchers to consider; exploratory analysis, visualization, spatial resolution, aetiology, scale and spatial weights. It is our intention that researchers seeking direction for using spatial cluster analysis methods, consider the caveats and strengths of each approach, but also explore the numerous other methods available for this type of analysis. Applied spatial epidemiology researchers and practitioners should give special consideration to applying multiple tests to a dataset. Future research should focus on developing frameworks for selecting appropriate methods and the corresponding spatial weighting schemes...|$|R
