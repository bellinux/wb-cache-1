It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E
500|$|... "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] is a cover song {{recorded}} by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album Echo (2009). Originally written by Noel Gallagher of rock band Oasis, {{the song was}} produced by Lewis and Steve Robson. [...] Lewis decided to cover the track as she {{is a fan of}} Oasis and rock bands in general, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> liked the song's sentiment. The strings were performed by London Session Orchestra, who were organised and arranged by Will Malone. The musical structure of the song is different from the conventional style which is normally used, as the song's melody does not gain momentum {{until the end of the}} song instead of by the first chorus.|$|E
500|$|Abi {{attempts}} to impregnant herself {{by having a}} one-night stand with Babe's relative, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), following encouragement from Babe to have a one-night stand. Badland explained that Babe regrets encouraging Abi, saying [...] "She got a bit over-enthusiastic and she gave her bad advice. Babe saw herself in Abi <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wanted to help her." [...] Abi's attempt at getting pregnant is unsuccessful so when Abi suffers a fall in The Vic, Babe persuades Abi to fake a miscarriage. This leaves Ben [...] "crushed" [...] when he learns of Abi's miscarriage. This plot twist was criticised by Zoe Clark-Coates, co-founder and CEO of The Mariposa Trust, who said, [...] "To regularly see TV shows using fake miscarriages as light entertainment could make people question genuine losses." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's true," [...] {{asserted}} Crestwick. [...] "I {{was a bit}} of an imbecile, <b>and</b> <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> hard to beat. She says if {{the life}} here's too tough for me I'm to come back and live with them. That's considerate, because in a way she can't want me, though I haven't the least doubt she'd make Carew put up with my company. It decides the question--I'm not going." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{drew her}} nearer to him, and eyed her closely. Even his {{intelligence}} {{discovered that he}} had brought her to bay, <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> meant it! ...|$|R
500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, she {{appeared}} in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} show's 2016 Christmas special, [...] "The Best of Tracey Ullman's Show", Ullman plays a {{workaholic}} Clare Balding. [...] "I like Clare. She was {{captain of the}} volleyball team at school. I watched her present the Olympics <b>and</b> <b>she's</b> incredible. <b>She's</b> <b>really</b> passionate when talking about horses, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> talks <b>really</b> fast... 'Beautiful filly, beautiful filly...' She never stops, you never feel uncomfortable with her, {{she knows how to}} talk to everybody. And I got this feeling that she was like, 'Oh, don't worry, I'll work the Christmas holidays, I can do that show, I'll work Boxing Day as well, nothing like the holidays.' She never stops." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She gained time, as you see. While I {{waited for}} her to {{interfere}} you were marching away, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>really</b> beating the drum." ...|$|R

2500|$|Tricky {{was in a}} brief {{relationship}} with Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk in the 1990s. When asked in mid-2013 {{about the time the}} pair spent together, Tricky stated: [...] "I wasn't good for Björk. I wasn't healthy for her. I feel she was really good to me, she gave me a lot of love <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> was a good person to me. I think she cared about me, right?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{just sort}} of happened," [...] said Amos. [...] "It started with Kels, Tash’s older cousin. Kels has been singing for years and is in {{performing}} arts school in Boston. She has a really big instrument. I thought {{we had to do}} something together that works. ‘Candle: Coventry Carol’ in itself is an ancient song, and I thought it would lend itself to that. And then Tash was thinking she wanted to do a bawdy song. And I said no. She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re not doing that, we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there. And I thought that was important because we all sing together." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Franzen felt {{conflicted}} {{about his}} book The Corrections being chosen {{as a book}} club selection. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being {{in the company of}} other Oprah's Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had [...] "picked some good books, but she's picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> smart <b>and</b> <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> fighting the good fight." [...] Franzen added that his novel was a [...] "hard book for that audience." [...] Franzen also felt conflicted about being selected by Winfrey because he was hoping to attract a male audience.|$|R
6000|$|He {{would not}} be gainsaid, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>really</b> glad to escape {{the crowd in the}} car. He said: [...] "I'm going to take you home to get warm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, uncle, I {{really did}} make a mermaid; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> did come alive, for I saw the figure float away, and then Lorelei appeared," [...] said Fancy, very earnestly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along, dear," [...] said Ruth, [...] "and I'll {{show you}} the house. Don't mind Aunt Lora," [...] she whispered; [...] "she means well, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is splendid with Bill." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} some hours after that these {{ambiguous}} elements evaporated and vanished and loathing came, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> {{began to be}} thoroughly sick and ashamed of the whole disgraceful quarrel and scuffle.|$|E
60|$|Two {{great things}} had Olive to tell, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>really</b> glad that her uncle {{was not at}} home so that she might get at once to the telling.|$|R

6000|$|... 'With submission, my soul,' pleaded Mr Sparkler.

5000|$|According to Kate Beckinsale in The Making of Underworld, by the point-in-time of {{the events}} of the first movie, Selene had been a soldier of the Vampire Clan for so-long, it had {{gotten to the point where}} [...] "Selene's almost {{forgotten}} she's a woman, she's absolutely focused on revenge <b>and</b> killing, <b>and</b> <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> good at it. Then, she meets Michael, she starts to get a... kind of memory of what it's like to be human, and to be with humans. She's not completely human, but she is actually 'human' somewhere underneath there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And as long, dear, as WE {{are not the}} {{subjects}} of this youthful forgetfulness, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> isn't <b>really</b> finding US as stupid as the rancho," [...] replied her husband cheerfully, [...] "I suppose we mustn't complain." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "She is {{the very}} one I want to protect. I don't think that teazing her does any good; it only gives her cross feelings. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> has more right on her side than you think. You might be just as honest and bold if you were less rude and bearish." ...|$|E
60|$|It was too much. She {{did want}} to go so badly, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> couldn't resist any longer.
