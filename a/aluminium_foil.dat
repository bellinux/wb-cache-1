5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil,</b> which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors. This shot was drained of color entirely, and was combined {{with a series of}} blurring and framing effects in post-production to further enhance the intended image—to create the impression of waking from a dream.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil.</b> The mirrors consist of microscopic structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E
40|$|To inhibit {{dendrite}} formation for aluminium electrodeposition in room-temperature {{ionic liquid}} electrolyte, a promising method for electrodeposition of non-dendritic <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> on carbon cathodes is investigated. The effect of current density, deposition time, temperature, and cathode materials on the deposit morphology of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> in AlCl 3 - 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium chloride (AlCl 3 -[Bmim] Cl) ionic liquid electrolyte was also studied. The prepared <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> are compact, bright {{and easy to}} peel off from the carbon electrodes after electrodeposition. The experimental {{results show that the}} high current density and low electrowinning temperature is responsible for the compactness of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils.</b> The intensity of the (200) plane enhances with the increase of current density. Cathodic current efficiencies of the electrodeposition process are from 79 % to 87 %.

5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium {{is almost}} always alloyed, which {{markedly}} improves its mechanical properties, especially when tempered. For example, the common <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> is thick enough {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to determine how the shape of X-ray line profiles from stretched <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> is influenced by increasing levels of induced residual strain. Macroscopic residual strains from 4 % to values close to the breaking point (220 %) were induced by stretching annealed foils beyond the yield point into the plastic deformation region and then releasing the applied stress. X-ray data were collected using a Siemens D 5000 diffractometer fitted with a fine focus Cu X-ray tube and a graphite post-monochromator set for CuKa. In this analysis we have synthesised and fitted the instrument and broadened line profiles using a fundamental parameters approach to profile analysis. Parameters defining the instrument profiles 1 (20), such as the receiving slit width and the slit length, were obtained by fitting the profiles from annealed <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils.</b> The observed broadened profiles B(28) were then fitted as a convolution of a Voigt profile V(28) and the fitted instrument profile 1 (28), B=I*V=I*L*...|$|R

The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased Arabic gum, and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the Darfuri women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to {{a high risk of}} being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered.

25|$|Any object {{containing}} pointed {{metal can}} create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> (though some foil used in microwaves are safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape. Forks {{are a good}} example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This {{has the effect of}} exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3×106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.|$|E
40|$|Various {{microscopic}} techniques {{were used to}} characterize experimental micro- craters in <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> {{to prepare for the}} comprehensive analysis of the cometary and interstellar particle impacts in <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> to be returned by the Stardust mission.

A more detailed structural and compositional study of impactor remnants was then performed using TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), EDS, and electron diffraction methods. The TEM samples were prepared by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) methods. This technique proved to be especially valuable in studying impact crater residues and impact crater morphology.

Chronoamperometric tests were for this purpose performed in a three electrode cell to determine the current responses to variations in the selected operating parameters. Mathematical models accounting for charge transfer and diffusion limitations were implemented to attain fitting of the derived data, leading to an estimation of the number density of active sites.

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, milk-buying {{patterns}} have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) {{during the early}} hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two {{of the main reasons}} for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is {{the same as it was}} in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).|$|E

In 1970 he was awarded the Geelong Print Prize, and in 1971 he won the Comalco Invitation Award for Sculpture for having invented silver <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> print. Some of the other awards he {{received}} include the Maitland Print Prize (1967 and 1970), the Shepparton Print Prize (1970, shared with Jan Senbergs), and a Drawing Prize at the Second International Biennale for Drawing in Yugoslavia (1970). In 1974, following his retrospective exhibit at the Mornington Peninsula Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Australia acquired 279 of Baldessin's etching plates and prints: this set was the first nucleus of the National Gallery's collection of his works. Together with Imants Tillers, Baldessin represented Australia at the XIII São Paulo Art Biennial in 1975, exhibiting the set of etchings Occasional Images from a City Chamber, and the sculptural work Occasional Screens with Seating Arrangement. From 1975 to 1977 Baldessin lived in Paris; during his French sojourn he attended the Lacourière-Frélaut engraving workshop and hung out with Imants Tillers, soon becoming close friends with him.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E
