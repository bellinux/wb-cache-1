5|$|At the {{southern}} end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount. Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E

5|$|For the {{confrontation}} between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell {{decided to take}} inspiration from Bond's fight with Red Grant in From Russia with Love. Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean did all the stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.|$|E
5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. Painting the mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|Moon's {{friendship}} with Entwistle {{led to an}} appearance on Smash Your Head <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> Entwistle's first solo album and the first {{by a member of}} the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album; Jerry Shirley did, with Moon providing percussion. Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> West <b>Walls</b> {{are still}} needed to retain a former river cliff on the River Caldew and were not demolished. They have however been {{considerably}} altered over the years. Comparisons between old engravings and current archaeological evidence suggest <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> has been straightened. Between the bridge and the castle, there were houses built up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> until 1952. Other buildings erected <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> have been largely removed so <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> are visible again. Remaining buildings have been listed because they incorporate wall fragments.|$|R
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.|$|E
5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E

5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall {{for the rest of the}} service.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and directing collaborative Logan. It opens with a sequence of Stefani, as shown {{on the cover of}} the CD single, removing several pieces of clothing and later lying on a bed. After a scene with her in front of a white heart with roses, bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young play basketball while Stefani stands <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Stefani is then shown against a sparkling sky, followed by a scene of the whole band bicycling during Lady Saw's toast. The video closes with a scene of Stefani jumping on a bed in white undergarments and without makeup.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} intense as kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they had nowhere to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to riot in retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E

5|$|The {{two people}} fencing {{take off their}} masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her doppelgänger {{surprised}} to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Different artifacts from the Bond films {{are present in the}} room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E

5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
