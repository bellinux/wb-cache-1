5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games.

Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E

Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
