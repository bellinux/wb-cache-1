The {{final days of}} the campaign were marked by events in support of and opposition to joining the EU, as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb, while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 (some arrests occurred). The Croatian Bishops' Conference called on citizens to vote in the referendum, reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention; they said that the event represents <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> Croatia. In contrast to EU accession opponents' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Markač were released by the ICTY, Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia to vote in the referendum and said that he would vote in favour of joining the EU.|$|E

25|$|One {{view is that}} it {{was only}} a partial success for non-caste Hindus (Avarnas) as they gained access only to the roads on three sides of the temple. The fourth and most {{important}} eastern road remained inaccessible to them. It was really a blow to the Christians and Muslims as they lost their previously enjoyed freedom to have complete access on all the roads around the temple. Now the eastern road was blocked to them. Because of the gates, which remained closed the members of the Devaswam Board and the inmates of the temple who used the eastern road as thoroughfare were denied the opportunity. Anyway, it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the Indian National Congress party to grow in Kerala. Before this agitation, the Congress in Kerala was {{only a limited number of}} Upper Caste and Upper class people of Malabar (which was under British Rule). The Avarnas did not bother about the Congress, as the Congress leaders did not show any enthusiasm for the eradication of social inequalities. But when the party undertook to lead the agitation at Vaikom, the Avarnas underwent a sea of changes. At the exhortation of T. K. Madhavan, they joined the Congress en masse. The Congress swelled from being a class party to a mass party.|$|E

500|$|Like {{one of his}} predecessors, Elpidius, who had rebelled under Irene of Athens, Euphemius {{resolved}} to seek refuge among the Empire's enemies and with a few supporters sailed to Ifriqiya. There he sent a delegation to the Aghlabid court, which pleaded with the Aghlabid emir Ziyadat Allah for an army to help Euphemius conquer Sicily, after which he would pay the Aghlabids an annual tribute. This offer came as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the Aghlabids, who faced long-simmering ethnic tensions between Arab settlers and Berbers, dissension and rebellions within the Arab ruling elite (the jund), and criticism for their preoccupation with worldly concerns, their [...] "un-Islamic" [...] system of taxation and their luxurious lifestyle from the jurists of the Malikite school. Indeed, {{at the time of}} Euphemius' arrival, Ziyadat Allah had just suppressed a dangerous three-year revolt of the jund under Mansur al-Tunbudhi. As Alex Metcalfe writes, [...] "by undertaking a jihad to expand the frontiers of Islam {{at the expense of the}} infidels by conquest – the first major undertaking since the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 – they could silence the criticism of the jurists. At the same time, they could redirect the destructive energies of a restless jund across the Ifriqiyan–Sicilian channel to secure new sources of manpower and wealth".|$|E

500|$|By the 1860s, {{the first}} Swedish railway main lines (...) were {{completed}} {{in the southern part}} of the country, and by 1881 the Northern Main Line had reached Ånge. This, and the opening of the railway line connecting Sundsvall–Östersund–Trondheim (the Central and Meråker Lines) a year later strengthened the plans for a defensive line in the middlemost provinces of Norrland. At the same time, on the other side of the Bothnian Gulf, the Finnish main railway to Oulu had almost been completed, and would soon be of great use for the Russians to transport military personnel and supplies towards the Swedish border in case of war. Combined with the planned Luleå–Boden–Gällivare–Kiruna–Narvik railway stretch (the Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines), this would pose <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the Russians to fulfill their latent wish to seize control of northern Scandinavia and the Atlantic ports on the Norwegian coast.

This was also noticed by the Riksdag member Johan Erik Nyström from Norrbotten's electoral district whoworried about the railway to Ouluput forward a motion about strengthening the Upper Norrland defence in 1885.
