5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E

5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E

5|$|More {{primitive}} relatives such as Noasaurus and Ceratosaurus had longer, mobile {{arms with}} fingers and claws. Paleobiologist Alexander O.

5|$|The breed {{owes its}} {{survival}} {{to a small}} group of enthusiasts, working with the French National Stud. <b>A</b> <b>genetic</b> study performed in 1994 revealed <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> bottleneck in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Québec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of inbreeding, leading the Unité Nationale de Sélection et de Promotion de Race to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998. At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and Belgian horses was suggested to increase genetic diversity using morphologically and historically similar breeds. The French government distributes bonuses to the owners of the best stallions, a program more important to the Poitevin than to other draft breeds because of the significant possibility of extinction.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E

5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
40|$|Assembly {{sequence}} {{planning is}} a combinatorial optimization problem with highly non linear geometric constraints. Most proposed solution methodologies {{are based on}} graph theory and involve complex geometric and physical analyses.

This paper proposes <b>an</b> adaptive <b>genetic</b> algorithm (AGA) for efficiently finding global-optimal or near-global-optimal assembly sequences. The difference between <b>an</b> adaptive <b>genetic</b> algorithm and <b>a</b> classical <b>genetic</b> algorithm is that genetic-operator probabilities for <b>an</b> adaptive <b>genetic</b> algorithm are varied according to certain rules, but genetic-operator probabilities for <b>a</b> classical <b>genetic</b> algorithm are fixed. For our AGA, we build a simulation function to preestimate our GA search process, use our simulation function to calculate optimal genetic-operator probability settings for a given structure, and then use our calculated genetic-operator probability settings to dynamically optimize our AGA search for an optimal assembly sequence. Experimental results show that our adaptive genetic assembly-sequence planner solves combinatorial assembly problems quickly, reliably, and accurately...|$|R
