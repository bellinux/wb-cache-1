40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 During {{ferrochrome}} (FeCr) production, {{three types}} of generic chromium (Cr) containing wastes are generated, i. e. slag, bag filter dust (BFD) and venturi sludge. The loss of these Cr units contributes significantly to the loss in revenue for FeCr producers. In this study, the liberation of Cr units was investigated utilising two case study waste materials, i. e. BFD from a semi-closed submerged arc furnace (SAF) operating on <b>acid</b> <b>slag</b> and the ultrafine fraction of slag (UFS) originating from a smelter operating with both open and closed SAFs on <b>acid</b> <b>slag.</b> A detailed material characterisation was conducted for both case study materials, which included particle size distribution, chemical composition, chemical surface composition and crystalline content. Cr liberation was achieved utilising two methods, i. e. aqueous ozonation and the advanced oxidation method. Various advanced oxidation processes could be applied. However, the advanced oxidation processes considered {{in this study was}} the use of gaseous ozone (O 3) in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Controlling parameters such as the influence of pH, ozonation contact time, waste material solid loading, gaseous O 3 concentration and temperature on Cr liberation were investigated for the aqueous ozonation process. The influence of pH, volume H 2 O 2 added and the method of H 2 O 2 addition were considered for the advanced oxidation process. Results indicated that with aqueous ozonation, limited Cr liberation could be achieved. The maximum Cr liberation achieved was only 4. 2 % for BFD by varying the process controlling parameters. The Cr liberation for UFS was significantly lower than that of the BFD. The difference in the results for the two waste materials was attributed to the difference in characteristics of the materials. The Cr content in BFD was mostly related to chromite and/or altered chromite particles, while the Cr content of the UFS was mostly related to FeCr particles. It is possible that the Cr(III) present in the chromite and/or partially altered chromite might be more susceptible to oxidation to Cr(VI) than the metallic Cr(0) present in the FeCr. During ozonation, aqueous O 3 spontaneously decomposes to form hydroxyl (OH•) radicals, which are very strong oxidants in water. The above-mentioned Cr liberation observed was related to the formation of the OH• radicals during the spontaneous decomposition of aqueous O 3. This was indicated especially by enhanced Cr liberation at higher pH values, which was attributed to the acceleration of the spontaneous decomposition to OH• radicals at higher pH levels. The advanced oxidation method gave significantly higher Cr liberation results for both case study materials considered, achieving Cr liberations of more than 21 %. The advance oxidation processes improve normal oxidation methods. In this study, the H 2 O 2 used in combination with O 3 enhanced the formation of the OH• radicals that are responsible for the oxidation of Cr. The Cr liberation levels achieved are possibly not high enough to be feasible for industrial purposes. However, a further investigation of the advanced oxidation process could optimise the process to yield even higher Cr liberation. Master...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA ground {{blast-furnace}} {{granulated slag}} {{used in the}} production of construction materials and items differs in its chemical composition, dispersion, the quantity of amorphous phase and so on, which leads to the change of properties of the blended cement consisted of CEM I and supplemented with different amount of slag. The chemical and mineralogical composition of portland cement, the conditions of its maturing, activators and others also influence on the properties of the blended cement. The <b>acid</b> <b>slag</b> is not binding in contrast to the basic one, but due to the pozzolanic properties it interacts with the calcium hydroxide to form an additional amount of a low-basic hydrated calcium silicate in a hardened cement paste structure. The strength of the blended cement with increasing dosages of slag varies in different ways - small amount of slag in the cement even increases slightly the compressive and flexural strength in comparison with the blended cement without an additional CEM I. Increasing the dosage of slag in the blended cement, its compressive strength decreases slightly, especially at an early stage, and the flexural strength remains at the same level by increasing the dosage up to 70 - 80 % of blended cement slag mass. Besides the CEM I dilution effect, the increase of the mixture water demand with the increased slag dosage influences the strength of mortar samples of equally and easily workable mixtures. A true water-binder ratio is increased significantly if the content of slag is over 70 %. The conducted {{studies have shown that the}} substitution of CEM I with 70 % of slag is optimal both from the perspective of the impact on the technical characteristics of the resulting rock and from the economic point of view. The rock structure obtained from the blended cement differs in terms of high concentration of amorphized low-basic hydration products and the decrease in its content of Са(ОН) 2. The last is proportional to the number of slag additive and affects significantly the phase composition of the rock and its properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} hearth operation and the factors influencing the total quality of hot metal, especially its carbon and sulphur contents. Regarding the hot metal quality there are many sources of disturbances starting from raw materials, continuing through the blast furnace process and ending the hot metal casting. The carbon content of hot metal {{is an important part of}} the total quality of hot metal. Nearly 80  % of the total reaction energy in the BOF process comes from the oxidation of carbon in hot metal. Therefore, a high and stable carbon content of hot metal is most beneficial. Sulphur in hot metal is known to retard the carbonisation of hot metal. The sulphur content in hot metal is controlled by the sulphur load in the coke and other fuels as well as the slag basicity and low level of unreduced iron oxides. Both carbonisation and desulphurisation are strongly dependent on the hearth operation. To secure a proper hearth operation the hearth coke, the deadman should neither be clogged nor get inactive. Good hearth operation prolongs the campaign life of the hearth lining improving thus the total economy. In this work the factors influencing the hot metal carbon content have been investigated. The carbonisation of solid iron starts in the shaft by CO gas and also by coke carbon when the metal melts down. Hot metal does not get saturated with carbon. The difference between the saturation and actual carbon contents was observed to be around 0. 7  % in average and it increases with increasing sulphur content. The carbon content of hot metal can be maintained on a high level by keeping the sulphur content of hot metal below 0. 05  % which can be attained with a sufficient slag basicity, e. g. CaO / SiO =  1. 2. A progressive vicious circle in blast furnace operation was observed. Problems may start with some disturbance in the hearth operation gradually resulting in low permeability or total clogging of the deadman. The raceways become shorter which leads to a hanging cohesive zone. A hanging cohesive zone transfers insufficiently reduced iron oxides into the slag. Desulphurisation of hot metal weakens due to a higher FeO content in the slag. A high sulphur content in hot metal promotes the precipitation of calcium sulphide. Calcium sulphide together with other compounds with high melting point may clog the hearth further. There are several factors which strengthen vicious circle like a low heat level, an overfilled hearth, too <b>acid</b> <b>slag</b> etc. Different factors influencing the hearth phenomena and start up of the vicious circle including CaS precipitation were observed and analysed in this work. Early warning symptoms of a clogged hearth and methods to identify an inactive deadman were collected. Measures to cure an inactive deadman were developed and practised as well. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion removal is {{key in the}} {{production}} of high quality steel. The inclusions are primarily removed from liquid steel by reacting with a liquid slag phase. For efficient inclusion removal, the inclusions transfer across the steel-slag interface to dissolve in the slag. This transfer process is strongly influenced by interfacial phenomena. In this study, the dynamic wetting (&# 0952;) of a range of slags in the CaO&# 8211;Al 2 O 3 &# 8211;SiO 2 &# 8211;(MgO) system on solid oxides representing inclusion phases (Al 2 O 3, MgAl 2 O 4 and CaO.

30|$|Detecting {{inclusions}} such as <b>acid</b> <b>slags</b> {{in steel}} mill products without causing damage {{is important for}} guaranteeing their quality and performance. Ultrasonic waves are widely used to detect inclusions, and the size and location of the inclusions can be evaluated from the flight time and amplitude of the scattered wave (Sachse 1975; Bifulco & Sachse 1975).

Over the past few decades, many studies on material characterization using ultrasonic waves have been reported. A technique to determine the grain size and homogeneity of materials using backscattered ultrasonic waves was proposed by Willems and Goebbels (Willems & Goebbels 1981). Castagnède et al. showed the decision method to determine the elastic constants in solid using frequency shift information and the velocity of an ultrasonic wave (Castagnède et al. 1990). Luo and Bungey used surface waves to determine the Young modulus and Poisson ratio of concrete materials (Luo & Bungey 1996), and Rogers utilized the phase velocity of Lamb waves for the estimation of the elastic constants in plates (Rogers 1995).|$|R

The results show that basic ladle-type slags exhibit lower σLS with oxide phases examined compared to that of <b>acid</b> tundish-type <b>slags.</b> Also, within the <b>slag</b> types (<b>acid</b> and base), σLS was observed to decrease with increasing slag basicity.

40|$|During the {{refining}} {{of steel}} by basic processes, {{a multitude of}} mineralogical reactions {{take place in the}} refractories with which the furnace is lined. The reactions are caused by an influx of material from the slag and are a function of the composition of the slag and of the refractory. The flow of material from the slag into the refractory resembles the process of metasomatism encountered in nature. The reactions between slags of different composition and magnesiteand chromite-containing refractories could be studied systematically {{as a result of a}} series of four experiments. During each of the experiments four different refractories were subjected to the influence of a slag having a specific composition for a considerable length of time. The experiments were conducted in a rotating furnace at 1700 ° 0 ~ Mineralogical reactions in the refractories used in these experiments can be divided into two main categories, viz. reactions involving the oxides and reactions involving the silicates. The relevant oxides are periclase, the sesquioxides and spinel. Periclase is found to Mndergo reactions like grain growth, resorption and elongation normal to the hot face of the refractory. These reactions are dependent on the composition of the refractory and of the metasomatised components. Reaction between periclase and sesquioxides yield spinel, provided there is no excess of lime. Exsolution of bodies of spinel from periclase is governed by the crystal-chemistry of both minerals. At elevated temperature, spinel, and more specifically chromite, acts as a source of sesquioxides in general, and of ferric oxide in particular. The stability of chromite depends on the molecular ratio between lime and silica of both the refractory and the slag. This ratio determines the amount of sesquioxides present, but not in spinel or in periclase, i. e. in the matrix of the refractory. The postulation of the reactions involving the silicates is possible because of the tendency of the refractory to reach equilibrium with the composition of the slag. The silicates present in <b>acid</b> <b>slags</b> are not in equilibrium with magnesia in the refractory, and consequent reaction yields the minerals monticellite and merwinite. These minerals are not in equilibrium with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories which have high molecular lime/silica ratios and also not with the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories having ver. y low molecular lime/silica ratios. Reaction between metasomatic and autochthonous silicates result in a new set of silicates. The silicates present in basic slags are in equilibrium with magnesia of the refractories as well as with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios. Consequently, no reaction results. Reaction does, however, take place between the silicates supplied by basic slags and the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories. Ultrabasic slags react mildly with magnesite and drastically with chrome-magnesite bricks. The reason is that in the former reaction, only monticellite and merwinite are not in equilibrium with the composition of the melt, but these minerals have a relatively high mobility, and migrate de~per into the refractory. In chromite-containing refractories, however, neither of the minerals chromite, monticellite or forsterite are in equilibrium with the composition of the slag. Reaction results in the formation of an association of minerals in the area of contact between the slag and the refractory which differs completely from the original minerals of the refractory. The conclusion arrived at is that chromite has a beneficial influence on refractories used in contact with less basic slags, because of the textural superiority of chromite-containing refractories over magnesite refractories. In contact with basic slags, however, metasomatism leads to the formation of components which have low melting points and low viscosities. During the refining of steel by basic processes, ultrabasic slags are preferred and magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios are better suited for use in contact with the liquid slag.

Therefore, alumina was removed (or recovered) from bauxite residue by alkali roasting prior to smelting. The sample after alumina removal could be smelted at 1500 °C without the need of adding any flux to obtain a clear slag–metal separation. After smelting, the slag was leached with acids (HCl, H 2 SO 4, or HNO 3). The recovery yields of the rare-earth elements (REEs), except scandium, drastically decreased in the low-alumina slags, compared to the original bauxite residue. These poorer recovery yields are due {{to the formation of}} a perovskite (CaTiO 3) phase, which binds REEs except scandium. CaTiO 3 is a stable phase and does not dissolve in acids under normal conditions. Therefore, slag was quenched to suppress the CaTiO 3 formation.
