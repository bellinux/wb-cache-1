We find that FDI <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>growth</b> are significant determinants of each other. We also find that export <b>growth</b> rate <b>and</b> human capital are statistically significant determinants of both FDI <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>growth.</b> Our findings lead us to conclude that FDI <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>growth</b> have an endogenous relationship.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatocyte <b>and</b> {{keratinocyte}} <b>growth</b> {{factors are}} key growth {{factors in the}} process of alveolar repair. We hypothesized that excessive alveolar destruction observed in lung emphysema involves impaired expression of hepatocyte <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factors or their respective receptors, c-met <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factor receptor. The aim of our study was to compare the expression of hepatocyte <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factors <b>and</b> their receptors in lung samples from 3 groups of patients: emphysema; smokers without emphysema and non-smokers without emphysema. Methods Hepatocyte <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factor proteins were analysed by immunoassay and western blot; mRNA expression was measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Hepatocyte <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factors, c-met <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factor receptor mRNA levels were similar in emphysema and non-emphysema patients. Hepatocyte growth factor mRNA correlated negatively with FEV 1 and the FEV 1 /FVC ratio both in emphysema patients and in smokers with or without emphysema. Hepatocyte <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factor protein concentrations were similar in all patients' groups. Conclusion The expression of hepatocyte <b>and</b> keratinocyte <b>growth</b> factors <b>and</b> their receptors is preserved in patients with lung emphysema as compared to patients without emphysema.
