5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{is usually}} hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, {{but if the}} wall is {{directly}} exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it may become saturated <b>and</b> <b>collapse.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the expanding <b>and</b> <b>collapsing</b> regions by taking two well-known spherically symmetric spacetimes. For this purpose, the general formalism is developed by using Israel junction conditions for arbitrary spacetimes.

5|$|After a {{brief period}} of {{centralisation}} <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Qin dynasty, the area of Hong Kong was consolidated under the Kingdom of Nanyue, founded by general Zhao Tuo in 204 BC. When Nanyue lost the Han-Nanyue War in 111 BC, Hong Kong came under the Jiaozhi commandery of the Han dynasty. Archaeological evidence indicates an increase of population and flourish of salt production.

5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E

The U.S. forces were successful in repelling North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful. During this time, isolated reports and rumors of war crimes committed by both sides began to surface.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} combining blocking <b>and</b> <b>collapsing</b> – two widely used strategies {{for improving the}} accuracy of Gibbs sampling – {{in the context of}} probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We show that combining them is not straight-forward because collapsing (or eliminating variables) introduces new dependencies in the PGM and in computation-limited settings, this may adversely affect blocking. We therefore propose a principled approach for tackling this problem. Specifically, we develop two scoring functions, one each for blocking <b>and</b> <b>collapsing,</b> <b>and</b> formulate the problem of partitioning the variables in the PGM into blocked <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> subsets as simultaneously maximizing both scoring functions (i. e., a multi-objective optimization problem). We propose a dynamic, greedy algorithm for approximately solving this intractable optimization problem. Our dynamic algorithm periodically updates the partitioning into blocked <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> variables by leveraging correlation statistics gathered from the generated samples and enables rapid mixing by blocking together <b>and</b> <b>collapsing</b> highly correlated variables. We demonstrate experimentally the clear benefit of our dynamic approach: as more samples are drawn, our dynamic approach significantly outperforms static graph-based approaches by an order of magnitude in terms of accuracy. ...|$|R

5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes.

5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E

The transition period from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Greece is known as Sub-Mycenaean (c. 1050–1000 BC).|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E

5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot <b>and</b> <b>collapse.</b> Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops, {{hampered}} by supply shortages and massive losses, continually staged attacks on UN forces {{in an attempt}} to penetrate the perimeter <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> the line. However, the UN used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops, equipment, and logistics, and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the North Koreans during the fight. After six weeks, the North Korean force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15. The battle would be the furthest the North Korean troops would advance in the war, as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate.|$|E
