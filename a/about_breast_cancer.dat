25|$|Another {{art form}} has a wider range: the illness {{narrative}} {{has become a}} staple of breast cancer literature and is prominent in women's magazines.

The cure and quest narratives fit neatly with the breast cancer culture. Chaos narratives, which are rarer in stories <b>about</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> oppose it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{integrative}} {{review was}} to compare Latin American literature about risk and knowledge on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Of 47 studies selected, 20 were about knowledge or awareness and 27 <b>about</b> risk of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> English was the dominant language in studies about risk, whereas studies about knowledge were mainly written in Spanish or Portuguese. Studies about knowledge were all cross- sectional, whereas case- control studies dominated authors&# 8217; interest <b>about</b> risk of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Studies <b>about</b> knowledge were mainly focused on early detection {{of the disease and}} the most common study objective was breast self- examination (N = 14). In contrast, few studies <b>about</b> risk of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> focused on early detection (N = 5). Obesity and overweight (N = 14), family history (N = 13), decreased parity (N = 12), and short breastfeeding duration (N = 10) were among the most frequent identified risk factors. Socio- economic factors such as income and educational level had variable effects on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk and affected also knowledge of women about risk factors and early detection. Present results indicated that studies <b>about</b> risk of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> were more often based on a better sound analytical background, compared to studies about knowledge, which were mostly descriptive...|$|R

40|$|Aim This study {{investigated}} anxiety levels before, {{during and after}} mammography in the Waikato <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> screening pilot. Method A sample of 1085 women on the Waikato database were sent survey questionnaires, which included questions about the anxiety experienced. Data from 584 completed questionnaires were obtained. Results Two significant findings were identified. The first was that population-based screening can ultimately reduce anxiety for participants who receive a clear result from their mammogram. The second finding was that levels of worry throughout were related to ethnicity. Maori and Pacific Island women {{reported higher levels of}} worry than New Zealand European and Asian women <b>about</b> developing <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> (p< 0. 001), while awaiting their appointment (p= 0. 041) and results (p= 0. 046).
