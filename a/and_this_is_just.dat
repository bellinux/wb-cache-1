5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the beginning.|$|E
25|$|This was the 65th {{meeting between}} the teams with Nebraska clearly {{in control of the}} series 45–17–2 and 7–3 in the last 10. Nebraska went 8–4 last season and beat Colorado 30–3 in part of the tailspin of Colorado of the 2005 season. Colorado failed to prevent just its third 10-loss season in 117 years of intercollegiate {{football}} (going 1–10 in 1980 and 1984) as well as to end a 13-game losing streak to ranked teams. Nebraska had already captured the Big 12 North Division title and a bowl game yet to be determined. Colorado won’t be going to a bowl for just the fifth time since 1984, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> school’s fourth losing season in that time frame (1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006).|$|E
25|$|Later that night, Victoria {{returns to}} Roni's with a {{contract}} to have Roni sign over the place. Unfortunately, Roni changes her mind and tells Victoria {{that she is not}} selling out. Having been inspired by Jacinda's decision, she tells Victoria that she won't be ordered around by her, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the beginning. At the same time, Rogers examines a picture of Emma Swan in Lucy's book, and learns that his new partner is Detective Weaver. Henry begins work on a new story, and Jacinda returns to her job at Cluck's Chicken. On her way home, Jacinda finds a quarter and uses it to make a wish at the well, causing a hyacinth flower to sprout out of the ground.|$|E

25|$|The format {{followed}} {{that of the}} previous 1970 Match. This time the teams looked closer to equal strength, with average Elo grades being almost identical. Korchnoi had by now swapped sides, following his defection to the west <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one conceivable reason why Moscow (the logical 'home and away' choice for a re-match) was not put forward as a venue (there {{was a great deal}} of antagonism between Korchnoi and the Soviet authorities).|$|R
500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought {{it would be great to}} use a little person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a more literal interpretation of that idea." ...|$|R

500|$|He {{notes that}} a {{readable}} translation cannot always translate an Old English (OE) word the same way; thus eacen is rendered 'stalwart', 'broad', 'huge', and 'mighty', correctly {{in each case}} to fit the context, but losing the clue to the word's special meaning, [...] "not 'large' but 'enlarged'". The word implies, in fact, supernatural or superhuman power, like Beowulf's gift from God of [...] "thirtyfold strength". <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> an example, Tolkien points out, of a minor challenge to the translator.|$|E
500|$|The ounceland system {{seems to}} have become {{widespread}} down the west coast including much of Argyll <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as true {{of most of the}} south west apart from land adjacent to the inner Solway Firth. In Dumfries and Galloway the place name evidence is complex and of mixed Gaelic, Norse and Danish influence, the last most likely stemming from contact with the extensive Danish holdings in northern England. One feature of the area is the number of names with a [...] "kirk" [...] prefix followed by a saint's name such as Kirkoswald. Interpretation of this is not certain but it is also indicative of a mixed Gaelic/Norse population.|$|E

50|$|Chiyohakuhō slowly {{climbed the}} makushita {{division}} and upon taking his first yusho or tournament championship in January 2005 {{with a perfect}} 7-0 record from the rank of Makushita 4 he earned automatic promotion to the elite sekitori ranks. However, he had {{to pull out of}} his debut tournament in the second highest jūryō division with an injury and fell back to makushita. He did not re-establish himself as a sekitori wrestler until May 2007. After six unremarkable tournaments he took the jūryō division championship with a 13-2 record in May 2008, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> enough to earn him promotion to the top makuuchi division at the lowest rank of Maegashira 16 West.|$|R

What I read when I read the season premiere, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|Haley {{said the}} first time he heard his name {{mentioned}} in conjunction with the character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet, which he appreciated, and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller. Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past—that of a child murderer—for about a [...] "minute and a half". Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker, Haley came to the realization quickly {{that at the end of}} the day he is doing a horror film, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a fictional character. Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy just being a [...] "mythical boogeyman", it became [...] "very freeing" [...] for him as an actor.|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What {{do you want me to}} say? Everybody thinks he has the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E

[...] When David tracks Amy down; she blackmails him in return for the truth but David exposes her to Eric. Halfpenny said Amy was hurt by David's deception because she trusted him and despite their problems had a [...] "good relationship". Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because [...] "deep down he really cares about her." [...] The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy [...] "meeting her match." [...] As [...] "nothing is straight forward with Amy", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard. Amy settles into village life until Jared Haynes (Philip Hill-Pearson) arrives and blackmails Amy. An Emmerdale spokesperson {{revealed that}} Amy had an affair with Jared's father and ruined his family. [...] "She’s got herself in a mess <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the start of her problems." [...] Amy steals from Val and Eric to pay Jared off.

2500|$|Finally Kurzweil {{addresses}} {{identity with}} futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone, or gradually turning that same person into a nonbiological entity one surgery at a time. In {{the first case}} {{it is tempting to}} say the clone is not the original person, because the original person still exists. Kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person. He explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is [...] "the ability to be copied, backed up, and re-created" [...] <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> something people will have to get used to. Kurzweil believes identity [...] "is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us" [...] and that humans are not bound to a specific [...] "substrate" [...] like biology.|$|E

Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation.
