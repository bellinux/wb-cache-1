50|$|The most {{significant}} difference between a second party logistics provider and a third-party logistics provider {{is the fact that}} a 3PL provider is always integrated in the customs system. The 2PL is not integrated, in contrast to the 3PL he is only an outsourced logistics provider with no system integration. A 2PL works often on <b>call</b> (e.g. express <b>parcel</b> <b>services)</b> whereas a 3PL is almost every time informed about the workload of the near future. Another point that differs 2 and 3PL is the specification and customizing of services. A 2PL normally only provides standardized services. 3PL’s against it often provide services that are customized and specialized on the needs of their customer. This is possible by the long term contracts that are usual in the third-party logistics market. So there are customized logistics services are needed the contracts in the 3PL segment have to be long term, because customizing always costs money. A cost effectiveness for the third-party logistics provider is only given over longer periods of time with a stable contract and stable profits. In contrast to that second party logistic services can’t be customized, concerning to the fluctuating market with hard competition and a price battle on a low level. And there we have another distinguishing point between 2PL and 3PL: Durability of contracts. 3PL contracts are long term contracts, whereas 2PL contracts are of a low durability, so that the customer is flexible in responding to market and price changes.|$|R
