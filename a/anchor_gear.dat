Erie anchored again in Rockland Harbor {{at the conclusion of}} the runs. Erie returned to the trial course in West Penobscot Bay at 0558 the following morning to perform another 6 standardization runs, this time at 15 and 20 knots. She also teasted her <b>anchor</b> <b>gear</b> at this time. At the conclusion to these tests she sailed to Portsmouth Navy Yard in order to re-fuel, she arrived at 1712. At 0529 on 11 March, Erie got underway and {{proceeded to}} sea for a four-hour endurance and fuel oil consumption rate trial at 15 knots. A further 6 standardization runs at 17.5 and 20 knots were performed after the noon meal and she returned to Rockland Harbor at 1827. On 12 March, Erie spent most of the morning performing standardization runs at 9 and 12 knots followed by another four hour endurance and fuel oil consumption trial then tests of the steering gear and engine reversals while operating at full power, anchoring again in Rockland Harbor at 1842. Erie finished her formal trials on 13 March, with a three-hour endurance and fuel consumption trial at 12 knots, returning to Rockland Harbor later that day.|$|E

Empty pipes, as well as open and closed water-filled pipes, are impacted at different velocities. Results in terms of force-displacement curves are quite similar for the empty and open water-filled pipes, while the closed water-filled pipes react differently {{as a consequence of}} internal pressure build-up during impact.

Further, dynamic impact tests at prescribed velocities were carried out on simply supported full scale X 65 steel pipes.

40|$|In the Gulf of Maine, the {{entanglement}} of humpback {{whales in}} fishing gear {{is a substantial}} source of human-caused mortality. The current mortality and serious injury of humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine is twice the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level set for this population. Researchers and managers are challenged to reduce entanglement to below PBR without extensive information on many important factors. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe entanglement injuries and investigate whether different fishing gear types, particularly pot and net fisheries, resulted in distinctive entanglement patterns of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine. I searched the Center for Coastal Studies' entanglement database for whales that fit the following criteria: the entanglement occurred between 1995 and 2002, the whale was photographed during the disentanglement, and the gear type or line type of the entangling gear was known. Sixteen cases were identified that fit the criteria. Three cases involved entanglements in pot fishery gear, four in net gear, and nine cases with known line type. I qualitatively analyzed photographs from these sixteen cases to describe the injuries and to investigate whether any entanglement patterns could be determined based on gear type in terms of location of entanglement on whale, presence of trailing gear, presence of buoys or high flyers, free swimming versus <b>anchored</b> in <b>gear,</b> disentanglement success, or type of injury. I was unable to find a relationship between entangling gear type and any of the factors assessed.

40|$|Non-native {{invasive}} species {{are a major}} threat to biodiversity, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems are naturally rather isolated from one another. Nonetheless, {{invasive species}} often spread rapidly across water sheds. This spread is to a large extent realized by human activities that provide vectors. For example, recreational boats can carry invasive species propagules as ‘aquatic hitch-hikers’ within and across water sheds. We used invasive gobies in Switzerland as a case study to test the plausibility that recreational boats can serve as vectors for invasive fish and that fish eggs can serve as propagules. We found that the peak season of boat movements across Switzerland and the goby spawning season overlap temporally. It is thus plausible that goby eggs attached to boats, <b>anchors</b> or <b>gear</b> may be transported across watersheds. In experimental trials we found that goby eggs show resistance to physical removal (90 mN attachment strength of individual eggs) and stay attached if exposed to rapid water flow (2. 8 m s- 138 for 1 h). When exposing the eggs to air, we found that hatching success remained high (> 95 %) even after eggs had been out of water for up to 24 h. It is thus plausible that eggs survive during pick up, within water and overland transport by boats. We complemented the experimental plausibility tests with a survey on how decision makers from inside and outside academia rate the feasibility of managing recreational boats as vectors. We found consensus that an installation of a preventive boat vector management is considered an effective and urgent measure. This study advances our understanding of the potential of recreational boats to serve as vectors for invasive vertebrate species, and demonstrates that preventive management of recreational boats is considered feasible by relevant decision makers in- and outside academia...|$|R

This thesis {{is a continuation of}} work carried out in previous master theses on the subject and a part of an ongoing research program at SIMLab (NTNU) and Statoil ASA. Three pipes were deformed quasi-statically with different horizontal loads applied in the stretch bending rig at SIMLab. A deformation rate of 25 mm/min was applied. A visual inspection after bending could not reveal any cracks. An isotropic hardening material model was used as input for the numerical simulations in Abaqus/Explicit by the use of the SIMLab Material Model. A very good fit in the global response could be seen when comparing the numerical simulations with the corresponding experiments. When checking the strain evolution for the critical elements, a plastic hinge could be seen. It could also be seen that the largest strains were smaller in pipes with horizontal load compared to pipes without horizontal load. Digital Image Correlation was utilized to validate the numerical simulations, by comparing strains close to the indentation zone. This gave a reasonably well compliance. </p...|$|R

40|$|While in service, {{pipelines}} may {{from time}} to time be exposed to impact loads from <b>anchors</b> or trawl <b>gear.</b> A lot of parameters influence the behaviour of the pipeline during impact, e. g. the diameter and thickness of the pipeline, the impactor's mass and velocity, and of course the material used. Also potentially influencing the deformation pattern is the presence of surrounding water, which can be a difficult parameter to include experimentally. The pressurised contents of the pipeline can also be an influencing factor. To gain some insight into how the water and possible pressure inside the pipeline affect the global impact behaviour, numerical investigations have been carried out using FSI- techniques available in the explicit finite element code Europlexus. One case was set up for validation against available experimental data, and additional cases examined numerically the effect of including pressure and/or surrounding water. The simulations generally captured the deformation and load levels from the experiments well, and may be assumed to represent the events with reasonable accuracy. Adding internal pressure generally led to a higher peak load, and created a more localised deformation. Submerging the pipe in water seemed to be of minor importance with respect to global and local deformation, but this depended heavily on the FSI conditions. Other parameters than the surrounding water, which for design purposes may be omitted, appear to be more significant to the global and local response. JRC.

40|$|One {{potential}} life-limiting {{mechanism in}} a Hall thruster is {{the erosion of}} the ceramic material comprising the discharge channel. This is especially true for missions that require long thrusting periods and can be problematic for lifetime qualification, especially when attempting to qualify a thruster by analysis rather than a test lasting the full duration of the mission. In addition to lifetime, several analytical and numerical models include electrode erosion as a mechanism contributing to enhanced transport properties. However, there is still a great deal of dispute over the importance of erosion to transport in Hall thrusters. The capability to perform an in-situ measurement of discharge channel erosion is useful in addressing both the lifetime and transport concerns. An in-situ measurement would allow for real-time data regarding the erosion rates at different operating points, providing a quick method for empirically <b>anchoring</b> any analysis <b>geared</b> towards lifetime qualification. Erosion rate data over a thruster s operating envelope would also be useful in the modeling of the detailed physics inside the discharge chamber. There are many different sensors and techniques that have been employed to quantify discharge channel erosion in Hall thrusters. Snapshots of the wear pattern can be obtained at regular shutdown intervals using laser profilometry. Many non-intrusive techniques of varying complexity and sensitivity have been employed to detect the time-varying presence of erosion products in the thruster plume. These include the use quartz crystal microbalances, emission spectroscopy, laser induced flourescence, and cavity ring-down spectroscopy. While these techniques can provide a very accurate picture of the level of eroded material in the thruster plume, it is more difficult to use them to determine the location from which the material was eroded. Furthermore, none of the methods cited provide a true in-situ measure of erosion at the channel surface while the thruster is in operation (i. e. none yield a continuous channel erosion measurement). A recent fundamental sensor development effort has led to a novel regression, erosion, and ablation sensor technology (REAST). The REAST sensor allows for measurement of real-time surface erosion rates at a discrete surface location. The sensor was tested using a linear Hall thruster geometry (see Fig. 1), which served as a means of producing plasma erosion of a ceramic discharge chamber. The mass flow rate, discharge voltage, and applied magnetic field strength could be varied, allowing for erosion measurements over a broad thruster operating envelope. Results are presented demonstrating the ability of the REAST sensor to capture not only the insulator erosion rates but also changes in these rates {{as a function of the}} discharge parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} to provide localized, real-time monitoring of material regression rates in various applications {{has the potential}} to provide a new stream of data for development testing of various components and systems, as well as serving as a monitoring tool in flight applications. These applications include, but are not limited to, the regression of a combusting solid fuel surface, the ablation of the throat in a chemical rocket or the heat shield of an aeroshell, and the monitoring of erosion in long-life plasma thrusters. The rate of regression in the first application is very fast, while the second and third are increasingly slower. A recent fundamental sensor development effort has led to a novel regression, erosion, and ablation sensor technology (REAST). The REAST sensor allows for measurement of real-time surface erosion rates at a discrete surface location. The sensor is optical, using two different, co-located fiber-optics to perform the regression measurement. The disparate optical transmission properties of the two fiber-optics makes it possible to measure the regression rate by monitoring the relative light attenuation through the fibers. As the fibers regress along with the parent material in which they are embedded, the relative light intensities through the two fibers changes, providing a measure of the regression rate. The optical nature of the system makes it relatively easy to use in a variety of harsh, high temperature environments, and it is also unaffected by the presence of electric and magnetic fields. In addition, the sensor could be used to perform optical spectroscopy on the light emitted by a process and collected by fibers, giving localized measurements of various properties. The {{capability to}} perform an in-situ measurement of material regression rates is useful in addressing a variety of physical issues in various applications. An in-situ measurement allows for real-time data regarding the erosion rates, providing a quick method for empirically <b>anchoring</b> any analysis <b>geared</b> towards lifetime qualification. Erosion rate data over an operating envelope could also be useful in the modeling detailed physical processes. The sensor has been embedded in many regressing media for the purposes of proof-of-concept testing. A gross demonstration of its capabilities was performed using a sanding wheel to remove layers of metal. A longer-term demonstration measurement involved the placement of the sensor in a brake pad, monitoring the removal of pad material associated with the normal wear-and-tear of driving. It was used to measure the regression rates of the combustable media in small model rocket motors and road flares. Finally, a test was performed using a sand blaster to remove small amounts of material at a time. This test was aimed at demonstrating the unit's present resolution, and is compared with laser profilometry data obtained simultaneously. At the lowest resolution levels, this unit should be useful in locally quantifying the erosion rates of the channel walls in plasma thrusters. ...|$|R
