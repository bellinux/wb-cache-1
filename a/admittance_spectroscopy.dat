50|$|Drive-level {{capacitance}} profiling (DLCP) {{is a type}} of capacitance-voltage-profiling characterization technique developed {{specifically for}} amorphous and polycrystalline materials, which have more anomalies such as deep levels, interface states, or non-uniformities. Whereas in standard C-V profiles the charge response is assumed to be linear (dQ = CdV), in DLCP profiles the charge response is expected to have significant non-linear behavior (dQ = C0dV + C1(dV)2 + C2(dV)3) due to the significant larger AC-signal amplitude used in the DLCP technique. DLCP can yield, like <b>admittance</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> both the spatial and the energetic distribution of defects. The energetic distribution is obtained by varying the frequency of the AC signal, whereas the spatial distribution is sustained by modifications in the applied DC-bias.|$|E

A large {{number of studies have}} been devoted to investigating structures containing Schottky barriers by the methods of <b>admittance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> [7 – 9]. But {{it should be noted that}} studies of the characteristics of p-i-n structures based on Ge/Si material system by the method of <b>admittance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> are still extremely rare. However, for device applications such as solar cells and photodetectors, p-i-n-structures are very important. In this work, we show the possibility of studying p-i-n-structures based on Si with Ge quantum dots by admittance methods.|$|E
40|$|For CdTe {{solar cells}} copper {{seems to be}} {{necessary}} to achieve best energy conversion efficiencies, whilst it {{is known to be}} the main reason of cell performance degradation due to its tendency to diffuse through the bulk. Some studies have shown a direct connection between defect concentration and copper, but little has been discussed about its relation to the CdTe etching. Within this study many samples with Cu/Au back-contact have been prepared with different etching times and tested applying thermal, luminous and electrical stresses. We have analyzed the aging effects on the cell performance and on the nature and concentration of the defects by means of a variety of characterization techniques, like atomic force microscopy, Raman, current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, drive level capacitance profiling and <b>admittance</b> <b>spectroscopies.</b> Results of the accelerated lifetime tests show that different performance degradation is observed for cells with differently etched absorber.

30|$|Self-assembled {{semiconductor}} {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have been intensively studied over past decades {{due to their}} great importance for both fundamental physics and device applications [1 – 3]. As the efficiency of single-layer QDs is relatively low, vertically aligned multilayer QDs are often adopted for practical applications [3 – 6]. By repeating dot layers separated by spacer layers with a few nanometers in thickness, a more homogeneous size distribution could be achieved, simultaneously with novel physical properties induced by coupling [7, 8]. The coupling effects between the vertically aligned QDs have been investigated by various macroscopic techniques such as photoluminescence (PL) and <b>admittance</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> [6, 8 – 13], which {{are found to be}} strongly dependent on the thickness of the spacer layer. On the other hand, both high-density QDs and QD molecules have attracted a lot of interests for their potential applications [3, 14], where the lateral couplings between adjacent QDs significantly modify the QDs’ properties. The lateral coupling effects have also been studied, mainly by macroscopic techniques such as PL spectroscopies [15, 16]. Due to the large scattering in QDs’ size, separation, or composition distribution, the quantum properties of coupled QDs obtained by the macroscopic methods would be greatly weakened or eliminated by the averaging effects. Up to now {{there are only a few}} microscopic studies performed by STM on InAs [17] and PbSe [18, 19] QD clusters recently. In these studies, current–voltage characteristics were found to vary with the dot number in the cluster, indicating the existence of lateral coupling.|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} electrochemical techniques, differential <b>admittance</b> and photocurrent <b>spectroscopy,</b> for {{the characterization}} of electronic and solid state properties of passive films and corrosion layers are described and critically evaluated. In order to get information on the electronic properties of passive film and corrosion layers {{as well as the}} necessary information to locate the characteristic energy levels of the passive film/electrolyte junction like: flat band potential (Ufb), conduction band edge (EC) or valence band edge (EV), a wide use of Mott-Schottky plots is usually reported in corrosion science and passivity studies. It has been shown, in several papers, that the use of simple M-S theory to get information on the electronic properties and energy levels location at the film/electrolyte interface can be seriously misleading and/or conflicting with the physical basis underlying the M-S theory. A critical appraisal of this approach to the study of very thin and thick anodic passive film grown on base-metals (Cr, Ni, Fe, SS etc [...] ) or on valve metals (Ta, Nb, W etc [...] ) is reported in this work, together with possible alternative approach to overcome some of the mentioned inconsistencies. At this aim the theory of amorphous semiconductor Schottky barrier, introduced several years ago in the study of passive film/electrolyte junction, is reviewed by taking into account some of the more recent results obtained by the present authors. Future developments of the theory appears necessary to get more exact quantitative information on the electronic properties of passive films, specially in the case of very thin film like those formed on base metals and their alloys. 	The second technique described in this chapter, devoted to the physico-chemical characterization of passive film and corrosion layers, is a more recent technique based on the analysis of the photo-electrochemical answer of passive film/electrolyte junction under illumination with photons having suitable energy. Such a technique usually referred to as Photocurrent Spectroscopy (PCS) has been developed {{on the basis of the}} large research effort carried out by several groups in the 1970 ’s and aimed to investigate the possible conversion of solar energy by means of electrochemical cells. In this work the fundamentals of semiconductor/electrolyte junctions under illumination will be highlighted both for crystalline and amorphous materials. The role of amorphous nature and film thickness on the photo-electrochemical answer of passive film/solution interface is reviewed as well the use of PCS for quantitative analysis of the film composition based on a semi-empirical correlation between optical band gap and difference of electronegativity of film constituents previously suggested by the present authors. In this frame the results of PCS studies on valve metal oxides and valve metal mixed oxides will be discussed in order to show the validity of the proposed method. The results of PCS studies aimed to get information on passive film composition and carried out by different authors on base metals (Fe, Cr, Ni) and their alloys, including stainless steel, will be also compared with compositional analysis carried out by well-established surface analysis techniques...|$|R
40|$|Cu(In, Ga) Se 2 -based (CIGS) {{solar cells}} have {{achieved}} efficiencies up to 20 %. Despite these excellent results, {{the understanding of}} the underlying mechanisms and the influence of defects on their performance is still incomplete. The determination of the energetic position of the defects and of their density of states is important. <b>Admittance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is an adequate technique for this. By varying the external voltage during the measurement, the spatial position where the defect distribution is sensed can be varied. However, the application of external biases can lead to metastable effects in the absorber and therefore to defect relaxation and changes in the doping distribution. Hence, it is important to separate between the effects caused by metastable changes and the change in sensing position of the <b>admittance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> measurement.

40|$|Mg-doped GaN {{films have}} been grown on (0 0 0 1) {{sapphire}} using metal organic vapour phase epitaxy. Use of different buffer layer strategies caused the threading dislocation density (TDD) in the GaN {{to be either}} approximately 2 × 109 cm− 2 or 1 × 1010 cm− 2.
