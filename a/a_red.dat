5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with <b>a</b> <b>red</b> cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with <b>a</b> <b>red</b> stripe down the seam and <b>a</b> <b>red</b> lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on <b>a</b> <b>red</b> baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form <b>a</b> <b>red</b> giant. The envelope of <b>a</b> <b>red</b> giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E

The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor.
