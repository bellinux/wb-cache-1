His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict. Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.|$|E
5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business. He played cricket <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Wales – {{the future}} Edward VIII – was keen to {{participate}} in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E

Hynes plays bass guitar when he is not acting.He loves live music and goes to gigs <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> lives with his parents Andrew Hynes and Lisa Hynes and his elder brother Milo and younger sister Lara just outside Oxford.|$|R
5|$|Hedwig Potthast, Himmler's young {{secretary}} {{starting in}} 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left {{her job in}} 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in Mecklenburg and later at Berchtesgaden. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in Gmund with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship {{for the sake of}} her daughter. Working as a nurse for the German Red Cross during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in Military District III (Berlin-Brandenburg). Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed Püppi ("dolly"); he phoned her every few days and visited <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|E
5|$|While {{based at}} Crosby-on-Eden with 59 OTU MacLachlan spent time flying {{other types of}} {{aircraft}} including the Bristol Beaufighter. On 20 August 1942 he was posted to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford for a short time. MacLachlan flew <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could regardless of the activity. He flew as a co-pilot in a Short Stirling heavy bomber and practiced fighter evasion techniques and then proceeded to fly 15 types of aircraft in 11 days. MacLachaln also flew Supermarine Spitfires, acting as an attacking fighter {{as well as the}} American-made Bell P-39 Airacobra. MacLachlan also flew with the No. 1426 Flight RAF which operated captured German aircraft. He flew a Ju 88, M2+MK formerly of Küsten Flieger Gruppe 106 which force-landed at RAF Chivenor in November 1941. Hew flew in a passenger on Heinkel He111 (AW177) 1H+EN of 5./KG 26 which force-landed in Scotland in February 1940. At this time he provided escort to the resident Messerschmitt Bf 110 at the unit as it moved around airfields, although it is unknown if he flew it. By 4 October 1942 he had received notice that he had been selected as an RAF representative to tour the United States lecturing British and American trainee's in United States Army Air Force facilities. MacLachlan left 59 OTU with immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|Hay {{was back}} with Derbyshire in the 1878 season, still beating Hickton to {{the mantle of}} second-choice bowler, though now he had to shake {{competition}} off from John Platts, in the same position. Though he never played <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did during the 1878 season on any further occasions, Hay's round-arm bowling was at times preferred to John Platts' occasional deceptively-layered pace. In the 1879 season Hay put in fewer games for Derbyshire as he was playing for Keighley.|$|E

25|$|Not long {{content with}} life in London, Fraser {{soon began to}} quit the mercantile counter <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to watch the gardeners at work. He befriended William Forsyth who at that time had charge of the Apothecaries' Garden; through that {{acquaintance}} he would have become familiar with his predecessor Mark Catesby's travels, as some of Catesby's specimens from his travels were housed at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and Catesby's writings and engravings on the flora of the Americas were also published by the time Fraser moved to London.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the 1930s Gerard continued to compete in trials and sprint races, and after purchasing a 1½ litre Riley Sprite he also began to participate in circuit racing. Early club races at his East Midlands home circuit Donington Park continued his success, with Gerard taking two victories over cars with much larger engines, as well as ninth in the prestigious Donington TT race. In between running the family business, Gerard continued to compete at Donington <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, driving in the Nuffield Trophy in 1938 and 1939, although without success. With war looming, in 1939 he also took the little Riley down to the Brooklands circuit in Surrey. At that year's Opening Meeting he took a highly creditable third place, and won a Campbell circuit handicap race later in the year.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Loung {{entered the}} ADL Intermediate School, and {{continued}} with English language {{learning and teaching}} (ESL) sessions. Meng and Eang both found employment with IBM on the evening shift, and Loung, now thirteen years old, cared for Maria after school until they returned home late at night. Meng sent money and packages, via the Asian community in Montreal, Canada, to his family in Cambodia <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could throughout the 1980s; some packages either did not arrive, or arrived {{with some of the}} contents missing. In 1985, Eang gave birth to her second daughter, Victoria, and Loung entered Essex Junction High School as a freshman. A few months later, Meng and Eang were sworn in as naturalized citizens of the United States. In early 1986, the Ungs moved, with the help of their sponsors, into their own modest two-story home in a nearby neighborhood, and Loung, now nearly sixteen years old, delighted in having her own personal room.|$|E
5000|$|Fitz Linkhorn barely {{managed to}} make a living pumping out cesspools, but his {{consuming}} vocation was [...] "Born Again" [...] preaching from the courthouse steps in Arroyo; it was a small, mostly Hispanic, and heavily Catholic town in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Fritz denounced all sins except drinking; because, being a drunk himself, he made sure he was both eloquently, and tastefully drunk <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> had two sons, Byron, who was weak and sickly, and Dove.|$|R
5000|$|He {{remained}} a first team regular the following season, until an injury sustained in February 1991 against Everton ruled {{him out for}} the rest of the campaign. For the rest of his Anfield career, Whelan was injured <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> not. <b>He</b> missed much of the 1991-92 season with injury, although returned to score a crucial equaliser against Portsmouth in the FA Cup semi-final, forcing a replay which Liverpool won on penalties. However, although he had recovered from another minor injury in time for the successful Cup final against Sunderland, he didn't feature, his place going to Jan Molby.|$|R
5000|$|Okamura {{designed}} Zone of the Enders {{to tell a}} story through gameplay sequences, {{rather than}} during cutscenes. As such, the staff focused on adding details such as the destroyed buildings to inform the player's objectives. Character designer Nobuyoshi Nishimura expressed difficulties in designing characters who would both fit the mechas and the 3D models. In order {{to take advantage of the}} 3D space, Nishimura sought to move the camera <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> tried not to [...] "go overboard" [...] during cutscenes to emphasize the appeal of the mechas during gameplay. During development of the game, producer Hideo Kojima assisted the team.|$|R
25|$|In June 2012, Henry joined Conference Premier side Luton Town on a free transfer, {{signing a}} two-year {{contract}} with the club. He was announced as club captain for the 2012–13 season. Henry made his Luton debut in the club's opening day 2–2 draw against Gateshead at Kenilworth Road on 11 August 2012, playing the whole match as Luton came from two goals down to salvage a point. He played in 43 games during the 2012–13 campaign, but missed {{the last part of}} the season due to a double hernia. Henry underwent an operation in April 2013 in order to be fit for pre-season training before the 2013–14 season. He later stated he had been carrying the injury for a large part of the season, which inhibited his ability to attack up the right wing <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did at Stevenage. New Luton manager John Still retained Henry as club captain for the 2013–14 season. Henry captained Luton to the Conference Premier title, and was part of a defence that kept a club-record 23 clean sheets.|$|E
500|$|Walters and Segev both noted {{inconsistencies}} between Wiesenthal's {{stories and}} his actual achievements. Segev concluded that Wiesenthal [...] "lied <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did" [...] {{because of his}} storytelling nature and survivor guilt. Daniel Finkelstein described Walters' research in Hunting Evil as impeccable and quoted Ben Barkow: [...] "Accepting that Wiesenthal was a showman and a braggart and, yes, even a liar, can live alongside acknowledging the contribution he made".|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Shelton {{began working}} on If I'm Honest, his tenth studio album, which details his {{personal}} and romantic life following his divorce from musician Miranda Lambert; despite {{the majority of the}} tracks on the album being recent events in his life, he wanted to write a song about partying, even though he admitted to not being able to do it <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> used to. He further discussed his inspiration behind the track to Rolling Stones Beville Dunkerley: ...|$|E

500|$|From {{his time}} in Egypt during the First World War, Clarke {{fell in love with}} the country and <b>he</b> {{returned}} there <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> had a great respect for the inhabitants, writing that they had [...] "the endearing qualities of humour and fortitude". Another particular love was film. In Cairo, during the Second World War, he was a regular at the cinema, a location that suited his photographic memory and preference for working at night; he often conducted meetings there. Films influenced his work in other ways, for instance in the inspiration he took from Northwest Passage to name the US Rangers.|$|R
500|$|Edward the Confessor is {{depicted}} on a throne {{and wearing a}} crown and holding a sceptre in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1066, Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became {{an important part of}} WilliamI's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects. At his death in 1087, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported: [...] " [...] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was in England … He was so stern and relentless … we must not forget the good order he kept in the land".|$|E
500|$|Making {{its first}} {{appearance}} in Halo 2, the Gravemind was introduced to dispel {{the idea that the}} Flood is a mindless virus. The character was designed by a Bungie team, including artists Robert McLees and Juan Ramirez, and slowly developed into a massive creature with tentacles and a frightening level of intelligence. Driven by a desire to spread, the Gravemind is cunning and manipulative; he forges alliances <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tries to consume his allies, tricking the Master Chief into aiding him while infecting the Chief's compatriots at the same time. The character has had a mixed reception by many critics upon his appearance in Halo 2, and reviewers including 1UP.com found his role in Halo 3 confusing and without clear motive. More positively, critic Aaron Sagers used Gravemind {{as an example of a}} [...] "frenemy" [...] — the creature's appearance made the Master Chief's fight against the Flood more personal and more dramatic.|$|E
500|$|Sprigg {{was raised}} on his father's [...] "Swan Ponds" [...] farm in Hampshire County, {{where his father}} {{provided}} a private tutor for his son's primary education. His father owned farms {{on both sides of}} the North Branch Potomac River in Hampshire County, Virginia, and Allegany County, Maryland. On March 7, 1844, the Maryland General Assembly passed an act authorizing Sprigg's father to freely move his slaves across state lines between his farms <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> deemed necessary. His father relocated the family from the Hampshire County farm to Cumberland in 1852. Sprigg continued his education in Cumberland, and, following the completion of his studies there, he moved to Baltimore to study jurisprudence under his uncle John Van Lear McMahon. He studied under his uncle until 1858, when he was admitted to the Maryland bar. Sprigg's practice of law underwent a hiatus during the American Civil War. He was a proponent of states' rights and sympathized with the cause of the Confederate States of America during the war; however, he did not take up arms during the conflict. During the war, his father died in Cumberland in 1864.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} Crowdy,--Crowdy, whose high-flown ideas hardly tallied with the stern realities of his life. Crowdy {{was the leader}} of those who had once held firmly by Protection. Crowdy had been staunchly true to his party since he had a party, though it had been said of him that the adventures of Crowdy in search of a party had been very long and very various. There had been no Goose with a bitterer tongue than Crowdy; but now in these days a spirit of {{quiescence}} had fallen on him; and though <b>he</b> spoke <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> ever, <b>he</b> did not wield so deadly a tomahawk.|$|R
5000|$|... "A happy accident...would take me...to {{and through}} Arizona..." [...] said {{forester}} Bernhard E. Fernow in 1897, writing about his trip with biologist C. Hart Merriam to explore Arizona. Fernow told the National Geographic Society about his delight at the unique environs of Arizona {{and desire to}} return <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> {{was not alone in}} this thinking as heightened awareness of the area brought more and more researchers. Scientific study of northern Arizona had begun in the 1850s with government-sponsored road and railway surveyors who preceded the settlers. The surveyors' reports to Washington, D.C., describing the natural wonders of the Flagstaff area and the Colorado Plateau, prompted other scientists to explore the area.|$|R
60|$|Under this superb canopy we rode for {{a couple}} of hours to our journey's end. The {{mountains}} round about us dark, lonely, and sad; the landscape as we saw it at night (it is not more cheerful in the daytime), the most solemn and forlorn I have ever seen. The feelings of almost terror with which, riding through the night, we approached this awful place, the centre of the world's past and future history, have no need to be noted down here. The recollection of those sensations must remain with a man as long as his memory lasts; and he should think of them <b>as</b> <b>often,</b> perhaps, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> should talk of them little.|$|R
500|$|Walter {{was not a}} holy man, {{although}} he was, as John Gillingham, a historian and biographer of Richard I, says, [...] "one of the most outstanding government ministers in English History". Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later canonised, {{is said to have}} asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> probably should have. Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was {{the driving force behind the}} administrative changes during Richard's reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard's brother John, and it was during John's reign that a number of Walter's administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John's interest in government and administration.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years after}} the release of Ænima, Tool {{announced}} a new album, Systema Encéphale, with a 12-song track list in January 2001. A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse. The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his [...] "dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists", Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he [...] "doesn't cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has in the past". In an interview with [...] NY Rock, Keenan explained, [...] "Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't matter if it is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for [...] "Schism" [...] are nothing more than my interpretation of the music." [...] The album became a worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week, and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for [...] "Schism". In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called [...] "Fallen" [...] with Thirty Seconds to Mars that was released on the band's self-titled debut album.|$|E
500|$|Peel was {{the first}} English bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Australia. At a time when {{international}} matches were relatively rare, his 20 Test matches were a considerable achievement, and it was unusual for a player to tour Australia <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did: he went there four times. His main rival as a spinner and for {{a place in the}} England team was Johnny Briggs; Peel bowled faster, which made him harder to hit. Archie MacLaren, who captained England from the late 1890s and was a team-mate and captain of Briggs, described Peel as [...] "the cleverest bowler of my time". MacLaren stated that Peel thoroughly understood tactics and could spot weaknesses in a batsman's technique. He concluded: [...] "I place Peel first on my list of great left-handed bowlers on account of his wonderful judgement, his diabolical cleverness and his great natural ability." [...] When Rhodes took over the role of left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, there was some debate over who out of Peate, Peel and Rhodes was the best left-arm spinner to play for Yorkshire. Historians regard Peel as part of a long-lasting chain of successful Yorkshire left-arm spinners, preceded by Peate and succeeded by Rhodes.|$|E
60|$|While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of {{the prisons}} {{were in the}} {{adjoining}} dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which <b>he</b> rested, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.|$|R

25|$|Despite being a {{decorated}} pilot, Nungesser was placed {{under house arrest}} {{on more than one}} occasion for flying without permission. He disliked strict military discipline and went to Paris to enjoy its many pleasures (such as alcohol and women) <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> was a leading fighter pilot whose combat exploits against the Germans were widely publicized in France. Nungesser's rugged good looks, flamboyant personality, and appetite for danger, beautiful women, wine, and fast cars made him the embodiment of the stereotypical flying ace. He would sometimes arrive for morning patrol still dressed in the tuxedo he'd worn the night before and even occasionally with a female companion. In contrast to the unsociable but nonetheless top French ace René Fonck, Nungesser was well liked by his comrades.|$|R
