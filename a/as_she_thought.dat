5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} for Ruma Maida {{was written by}} Ayu Utami, her first such work; mainly known for her novels, she had avoided screenplays <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> they were generally too commercially oriented. She wrote the screenplay {{over a period of}} six months beginning in 2008, when Lamp Pictures – which produced the film with Karuna Pictures– requested that she write a story about nationalism; according to the director Teddy Soeriaatmadja, who was brought in while the screenplay was still on its first draft, he and Utami read seven drafts of the screenplay before they agreed on the story. Considering the screenplay a way to encourage the younger generation to study Indonesian history, which she said could be fun, Utami decided to focus on education, diversity, and history.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E

25|$|In 1917 Catt {{received}} a bequest of $900,000 from Mrs. Frank (Miriam) Leslie {{to be used}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> best for the women's suffrage movement. Catt allocated most of the funds to the NAWSA, with $400,000 applied toward upgrading the Woman Citizen.|$|E
25|$|Jim Moray, an English folk singer, {{released}} the album 'Upcetera' in September 2016. It contains the track 'Sounds of Earth' {{in which he}} interweaves {{the stories of the}} production of the Golden Record and the romance between Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. It refers to the recording of an EEG of Druyan <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of Sagan as the sound of someone falling in love.|$|E

25|$|The film {{tells the}} story of two women {{separated}} by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed.|$|E
25|$|During the series, {{the main}} storyline follows Alex Drake in her {{struggle}} {{to return to}} the present day. In order to do this, she believes that preventing the death of her parents, Tim (Andrew Clover) and Caroline Price (Amelia Bullmore), will enable her to return. While watching the death of her parents in the finale of the first series, she discovers that the person she remembers taking her hand as a child was Gene Hunt and not Evan White (Stephen Campbell Moore) as she previously thought. This leads her to question if Hunt is real and not a figment of her imagination <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
25|$|Orlok is a {{fugitive}} on a distant planet, where he learns that a ten billion credit reward {{for the killing}} or kidnapping of Judge Dredd has been advertised by the Government-in-exile of East-Meg One, a band of ex-diplomats and others who survived the thermonuclear destruction of that city by Dredd's hand in 2104. Although {{not interested in the}} reward, he considers it unfitting that Dredd should be killed by anyone but himself, and heads for Earth. Arriving in Mega-City One, he is detected by Anderson, who tries to dissuade him from killing Dredd. Too late, she realises that Orlok has not changed as much <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> and she tries to arrest him, but Orlok overcomes her and takes her prisoner.|$|E

60|$|She was silent, therefore, and dismayed; {{and looked}} <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that her ways and Mary's ways must be different.|$|R

25|$|Harris's site {{attracted}} few visitors, {{and caused}} no concern until March 1998. Klebold gave the web address to Brooks Brown, a former friend of Harris. Brown's mother had filed numerous complaints with the Jefferson County Sheriff's office concerning Harris, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> he was dangerous. The website contained numerous death threats directed against Brown: Klebold {{knew that if}} Brooks accessed the address, he would discover the content and inform his parents, and likely the authorities would be notified. After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. The investigator Michael Guerra was told about the website. When he accessed it, Guerra discovered numerous violent threats directed against the students and teachers of Columbine High School. Other material included blurbs that Harris had written about his general hatred of society, and his desire to kill those who annoyed him.|$|E
25|$|Result: Maria {{suggested}} that Odyssey create a cookbook aimed at professional women; whilst David and Andrew disagreed, everybody else did {{and despite the}} idea being badly received by the focus group, Maria persuaded Sean {{to go with it}} anyway, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that it was better to have a target market. The resulting book, while produced fairly professionally, was strongly criticised due to the cover not even making clear that it was a cookbook. On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of the retailers.|$|E
500|$|McCartney and Ono had {{attempted}} to purchase the catalogue in 1981. They were offered the catalogue for £20million ($40million USD) and proposed the pair would each pay £10million. Ono refused <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it was too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer {{at a press conference}} in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I think we can get it for 5.' So I said, 'Well ok, you know, let's see what we can do.' And we couldn't." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1974 and 1977, respectively, Millett {{published}} two autobiographical books. Flying (1974), a [...] "stream-of-consciousness memoir {{about her}} bisexuality", which explores her {{life after the}} success of Sexual Politics in what was described in The New York Times Book Review {{as an example of}} [...] "dazzling exhibitionism". Millett captured life <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> experienced and lived it, in a style like a documentary film. Sita (1977) explores her sexuality, particularly her lesbian lover who committed suicide and the effect on Millett's personal and private life.|$|E
500|$|Lhermitte and Moqadem {{married on}} September 22, 1990, {{and moved into}} the {{apartment}} of Dr. Michel Schaar, a physician, with whom Moqadem was residing. Schaar had befriended Moqadem's family in Morocco in the 1980s and served as the young man's host in Belgium, and Moqadem considered Schaar as an adoptive father. While Moqadem worked at a convenience store, it was Schaar that was the primary financial provider. [...] Lhermitte did not object to living with Schaar in his apartment <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it would be on a temporary basis.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a song specifically written for Jenkins, titled [...] "Abigail's Song". In the script {{it was written}} that the song was unique and specific to Doctor Who, and composer Murray Gold was contacted to write the song. Jenkins did a demo and then sang the song while filming the actual scene, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it would look more natural. Afterwards she sang the final version and new, lighter arrangement was composed by the National Orchestra of Wales. Selected pieces of music from this special, as composed by Gold, were released on [...] 21 March 2011 by Silva Screen Records.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "working mom", as {{described}} by Paltrow, Elizabeth is the central figure in the detective process. Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Elizabeth was [...] "lucky", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the disease's survivors were being left {{to deal with the}} newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs {{to be used in the}} film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. [...] "I was just another tourist taking pictures", she said, and added, [...] "I did feel a little pressure. When Steven Soderbergh gives you a photo assignment, you had better come back with something decent." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{accepted}} by Greenlight in January 2014, and was released on Steam in August that year. The day {{it was due to}} go live, news broke that actor Robin Williams had died from a suspected suicide. Quinn considered delaying the Steam release, as {{she did not want to}} be seen as taking advantage of Williams' death. She eventually decided to keep to the original release schedule, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that making the game available to those struggling with their own problems was more important than any negative publicity she might receive, writing, [...] "I can’t in good conscience hold back offering someone something that could help them start making real changes in their life for the sake of reducing the risk of offending people or hurting my own reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver, who {{had played}} Ripley {{throughout}} the series, wanted to liberate the character in Alien 3 as {{she did not want}} Ripley to become [...] "a figure of fun" [...] who would continuously [...] "wake up with monsters running around". The possibility of an Alien vs. Predator film was another reason for the character's death, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the concept [...] "sounded awful". However, Weaver was impressed with Whedon's script. She thought that the error during Ripley's cloning process would allow her to further explore the character, since Ripley becoming part human and part Alien would create uncertainty about where her loyalties lay. This was an interesting concept to Weaver, who thought the film brought back the spirit of Alien and Aliens. Weaver received a co-producer credit and was reportedly paid $11million.|$|E
