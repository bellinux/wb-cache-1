To establish the validity of this approach to directed antibody evolution, we used random <b>mutagenesis</b> <b>by</b> error-prone DNA shuffling and off-rate selection to improve the affinity of an anti-fluorescein scFv as a model system. After four rounds of selection of the library of mRNA-displayed scFv mutants, we obtained six different sequences encoding affinity-matured mutants with five consensus mutations. Kinetic analysis of the mutant scFvs revealed that the off-rates have been decreased by more than one order of magnitude and the dissociation constants were improved ∼ 30 -fold. The antigen-specificity was not improved by affinity maturation, but remained {{similar to that of the}} wild type. Although the five consensus mutations of the high-affinity mutants were scattered over the scFv sequence, <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> demonstrated that the critical mutations for improving affinity were the two that lay within the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Thus, mRNA display is expected to be useful for rapid artificial evolution of high-affinity diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies by optimizing their CDRs...|$|R

Signaling of Ephs is initiated in a multistep process {{leading to the}} assembly of higher-order signaling clusters that set off bidirectional signaling in interacting cells. However, the structural and mechanistic details of this assembly remained undefined. Here we present high-resolution structures of the complete EphA 2 ectodomain and complexes with ephrin-A 1 and A 5 as the base unit of an Eph cluster. The structures reveal an elongated architecture with novel Eph/Eph interactions, {{both within and outside}} of the Eph ligand-binding domain, that suggest the molecular mechanism underlying Eph/ephrin clustering.

40|$|AbstractClinical {{isolates}} {{of human}} parainfluenza virus type 1 in our laboratory {{were found to}} induce significantly different degrees of syncytium formation in CV- 1 cells. Sequence analysis of high- and low-fusion strains suggested that the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein {{was responsible for the}} differences in fusion activity. We exploited the strain differences to define the specific amino acid residues of the HN protein which were responsible for the low and high fusion activities The HN proteins of the two low-fusogenic strains 8389 and 45785, and the highly fusogenic strain C 35, were expressed in HeLa T 4 + cells and their fusion promotion activities were compared. When coexpressed with C 35 F, HNs from the low-fusogenic viruses were associated with much lower fusion activity then was C 95 HN, suggesting that the HN proteins modified the fusogenicity of the viruses. To identify the region of the HN protein responsible for this difference, we constructed a series of chimeric HN cDNAs combining 8389 and C 35 sequences. All chimetic HNs that contained C 35 sequence in the central 36 % of the protein exhibited high fusion promotion activity. Further <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> showed that a single Asn-to-Lys substitution at position 242 converted 8389 HN to a highly fusion-promoting molecule. Thus, the globular head of the FIN molecule is involved in fusion promotion activity...|$|R

The {{state of activation}} is also important for the replication of HIV- 1. We evaluated the properties of nef-, vif-, and vpr-minus macrophage-tropic HIV- 1 (JR) CSF in primary CD 4 + Th 1 - or Th 2 -like cell cultures which had been activated through CD 3 molecules {{in the presence of}} interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and IL- 12 (Th 1 -like culture) or IL- 4 (Th 2 -like culture), respectively. In activated Th 1 - or Th 2 -like cultures, replication of nef-minus HIV- 1 (JR-CSF) was markedly lower than that of wild-type HIV- 1. Subsequent <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> showed that (i) the presence of an acidic amino acid-rich domain (amino acid residues 72 to 75) in the Nef protein was critical for the enhancement of viral DNA synthesis, resulting in increased virus growth rate, and (ii) prolines that form part of Src homology 3 binding domain were not essential for viral replication. We also confirmed the importance of sites by using an HIV- 1 -infected animal model, the hu-PBL-SCID mouse system, representing HIV- 1 replication and pathogenesis in activated CD 4 + T cells in vivo.

40|$|Deletion mutants were {{constructed}} from pZEP 12, which contained the intact Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum endoxylanase gene (xynA). Deletion of 1. 75 kb from the N-terminal end of xynA {{resulted in a}} mutant enzyme that retained activity but lost thermostability. Deletion of 1. 05 kb from the C terminus did not alter thermostability or activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of T. saccharolyticum B 6 A-RI endoxylanase XynA was aligned with five other family F beta-glycanases by using the PILEUP program of the Genetics Computer Group package. This multiple alignment of amino acid sequences revealed six highly conserved motifs which included the consensus sequence consisting of a hydrophobic amino acid, Ser or Thr, Glu, a hydrophobic amino acid, Asp, and a hydrophobic amino acid in the catalytic domain. Endoxylanase was inhibited by EDAC [1 -(3 -dimethylamino propenyl) - 3 -ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride], suggesting that Asp and/or Glu was involved in catalysis. Three aspartic acids, two glutamic acids, and one histidine were conserved in all six enzymes aligned. Hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed that two Asp and one Glu occur in the same hydrophobic clusters in T. saccharolyticum B 6 A-RI endoxylanase and two other enzymes belonging to family F beta-glycanases and suggests their involvement in a catalytic triad. These two Asp and one Glu in XynA from T. saccharolyticum were targeted for <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> site-specific <b>mutagenesis.</b> Substitution of Asp- 537 and Asp- 602 by Asn and Glu- 600 by Gln completely destroyed endoxylanase activity.

40|$|Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a pore-forming toxin of the cholesterol-dependent {{cytolysin}} (CDC) {{family and}} a primary virulence factor of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. LLO mediates rupture of phagosomal membranes, thereby releasing bacteria into the growth-permissive host cell cytosol. Several unique features of LLO allow its activity to be precisely regulated {{in order to facilitate}} phagosomal escape, intracellular growth, and cell-to-cell spread. To improve our understanding of the multifaceted contribution of LLO to the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes, we developed a screen that combined saturation mutagenesis and signature tags, termed in vivo <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> saturation <b>mutagenesis</b> and signature tags (IVASS). We generated a library of LLO mutant strains, each harboring a single amino acid substitution and a signature tag, by using the previously described pPL 2 integration vector. The signature tags acted as molecular barcodes, enabling high-throughput, parallel analysis of 40 mutants in a single animal and identification of attenuated mutants by negative selection. Using the IVASS technique we were able to screen over 90 % of the 505 amino acids present in LLO and identified 60 attenuated mutants. Of these, 39 LLO residues were previously uncharacterized and potentially revealed novel functions of the toxin during infection. The mutants that were subsequently analyzed in vivo each conferred a 2 - to 4 -orders of magnitude loss in virulence compared to wild type, thereby validating the screening methods. Phenotypic analysis of the LLO mutant library using common in vitro techniques suggested that the functional contributions of some residues could only have been revealed through in vivo analysis. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology...|$|R
40|$|Trg is {{a member}} of a family of receptors that mediates {{chemotaxis}} by Escherichia coli. Its transmembrane domain is a loose four-helix bundle consisting of two helices from each of the two identical subunits. This domain mediates transmembrane signaling through a conformational change in which the second transmembrane segment (TM 2) is thought to move relative to TM 1, but mutational analysis of TM 2 by cysteine scanning had identified only a few positions at which substitutions perturbed function or induced signaling. Thus, we performed mutational <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> random <b>mutagenesis</b> and screening. Among 42 single-residue substitutions in TM 2 that detectably altered function, 16 had drastic effects on receptor activity. These substitutions defined a helical face of TM 2. This functionally important surface was directed into the protein interior of the transmembrane domain, where TM 2 faces the helices or the other subunit. The functionally perturbing substitutions did not appear to cause general disruption of receptor structure but rather had more specific effects, altering aspects of transmembrane signaling. An in vivo assay of signaling identified some substitutions that reduced and others that induced signaling. These two classes were distributed along adjacent helical faces in a pattern that strongly supports the notion that conformational signaling involves movement between TM 2 and TM 1 and that signaling is optimal when stable interactions are maintained across the interface between the homologous helices in the transmembrane domain. Our mutational analysis also revealed a striking tolerance of the chemoreceptor for substitutions, including charged residues, usually considered to be disruptive of transmembrane segments...|$|R
40|$|The pleckstrin {{homology}} (PH) domain {{is a small}} motif for membrane targeting in the signaling molecules. Phospholipase C (PLC) -γ 1 has two putative PH domains, an NH 2 -terminal and a split PH domain. Here {{we report}} studies on {{the interaction of the}} PH domain of PLC-γ 1 with translational elongation factor (EF) - 1 α, which {{has been shown to be}} a phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase activator. By pull-down of cell extract with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with various domains of PLC-γ 1 followed <b>by</b> peptide sequence <b>analysis,</b> we identified EF- 1 α as a binding partner of a split PH domain of PLC-γ 1. <b>Analysis</b> <b>by</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> of the PH domain revealed that the β 2 -sheet of a split PH domain is critical for the interaction with EF- 1 α. Moreover, Dot-blot assay shows that a split PH domain specifically binds to phosphoinositides including phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2). So the PH domain of PLC-γ 1 binds to both EF- 1 α and PlP 2. The binding affinity of EF- 1 α to the GST·PH domain fusion protein increased in the presence of PIP 2, although PIP 2 does not bind to EF- 1 α directly. This suggests that EF- 1 α may control the binding affinity between the PH domain and PIP 2. PLC-γ 1 is substantially activated in the presence of EF- 1 α with a bell-shaped curve in relation to the molar ratio between them, whereas a double point mutant PLC-γ 1 (Y 509 A/F 510 A) that lost its binding affinity to EF- 1 α shows basal level activity. Taken together, our data show that EF- 1 α plays a direct role in phosphoinositide metabolism of cellular signaling by regulating PLC-γ 1 activity via a split PH domain. close 313...|$|R

However ERα phosphorylation at the previously identified sites does not fully account for these receptor functions. To determine if additional ERα phosphorylation sites exist, COS- 1 cells expressing human ERα were labeled with [32 P]H 3 PO 4 in vivo and ERα tryptic phosphopeptides were isolated to identify phosphorylation sites. Results Previously uncharacterized phosphorylation sites at serines 46 / 47, 282, 294, and 559 were identified by manual Edman degradation and phosphoamino acid <b>analysis</b> and confirmed <b>by</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and phospho-specific antibodies. Antibodies detected phosphorylation of endogenous ERα in MCF- 7, MCF- 7 -LCC 2, and Ishikawa cancer cell lines by immunoblot. Mutation of Ser- 282 and Ser- 559 to alanine (S 282 A, S 559 A) resulted in ligand independent activation of ERα as determined by both ERE-driven reporter gene assays and endogenous pS 2 gene expression in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Mutation of Ser- 46 / 47 or Ser- 294 to alanine markedly reduced estradiol dependent reporter activation. Additionally protein kinase CK 2 {{was identified as a}} kinase that phosphorylated ERα at S 282 and S 559 using motif analysis, in vitro kinase assays, and incubation of cells with CK 2 kinase inhibitor. Conclusion These novel ERα phosphorylation sites represent new means for modulation of ERα activity.

Here, {{we show that}} glucose repression is controlled by DNA sequences that are located upstream of the transcribed region. Recombinant gene constructions, in which the amylase promoter sequences were fused with the transcribed region of the Adh gene, were expressed in transgenic Drosophila larvae. The expression of ADH from the recombinant gene was shown {{to be subject to}} glucose repression. The function of potential regulatory cis-acting elements within the glucose responsive upstream region was examined <b>by</b> deletion <b>analysis</b> and <b>by</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis,</b> coupled with expression assays in transformed larvae. The upstream deletion analysis showed that essential elements, both for overall activity and for glucose repression of the amylase gene, are located within a 109 -bp region upstream of the transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis of these upstream sequences showed that the TATA motif, at position - 31, and a novel 36 -bp element, at position - 109, were necessary for full activity of the amylase promoter. None of the introduced mutations resulted in loss of glucose responsiveness.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the deduced amino acid sequence of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA polymerase reported here suggests that the polymerase structure consists of domains carrying separate biological functions. The HSV- 1 enzyme is known to possess 5 '- 3 '-exonuclease (RNase H), 3 '- 5 '-exonuclease, and DNA polymerase catalytic activities. Sequence analysis suggests an arrangement of these activities into distinct domains resembling the organization of Escherichia coli polymerase I. In order to more precisely define the structure and C-terminal limits of a putative catalytic domain responsible for the DNA polymerization activity of the HSV- 1 enzyme, we have undertaken in vitro mutagenesis and computer modeling studies of the HSV- 1 DNA polymerase gene. Sequence analysis predicts that the major DNA polymerization domain of the HSV- 1 enzyme will be contained between residues 690 and 1100, and we present a three-dimensional model of this region, {{on the basis of}} the X-ray crystallographic structure of the E. coli polymerase I.

The first protocol, termed incorporational (INC) mutagenesis, utilizes high concentrations of BrdUrd in the culture medium to generate a high intracellular ratio of BrdUTP/dCTP.

Genetic studies using reversion analysis at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus were used to determine whether the mechanisms of these two BrdUrd mutagenesis protocols had enough specificity to be distinguishable by their ability to revert various mutants.
