Assistance for {{farmers and ranchers}} who suffered severe losses from the tornadoes was also available by June 3. After {{more than a month}} of being open, emergency shelters were set to be closed on June 18. On June 21, an educational road show made by FEMA visited the hardest hit areas in Oklahoma to urge residents to build storm cellars. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period {{in the wake of the}} tornadoes.

5|$|Continuing westward, Inez made {{landfall}} {{as a small}} hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, {{the storm}} flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. Nationwide, there were about 100deaths and $12million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000people were killed, and 60,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in nearly}} ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September30.

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools.

By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs.
