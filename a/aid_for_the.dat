After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05billion (2001USD, $1.36billion 2012USD).|$|E

Assistance for {{farmers and ranchers}} who suffered severe losses from the tornadoes was also available by June 3. After {{more than a month}} of being open, emergency shelters were set to be closed on June 18. On June 21, an educational road show made by FEMA visited the hardest hit areas in Oklahoma to urge residents to build storm cellars. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period {{in the wake of the}} tornadoes. Most of the applicants lived in Oklahoma and Cleveland counties, 3,800 and 3,757 persons respectively.

The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies.

5|$|Continuing westward, Inez made {{landfall}} {{as a small}} hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, {{the storm}} flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. Nationwide, there were about 100deaths and $12million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000people were killed, and 60,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in nearly}} ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September30.

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools.

By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs.
