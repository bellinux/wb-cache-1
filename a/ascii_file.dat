2500|$|Fallback and auto-detection: [...] UTF-8 {{provided}} {{backwards compatibility}} for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit extended ASCII encodings designed {{prior to the}} adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. [...] Part of the popularity of UTF-8 {{is due to the fact}} that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. [...] A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an extended <b>ASCII</b> <b>file</b> as input can [...] "fall back" [...] or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode Latin-1 Supplement block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. Though it does happen, the 8-bit characters in extended ASCII encodings do not usually have the correct form for UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the 8-bit bytes which introduce multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 continuation bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. [...] To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters. In short, extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and not significantly. [...] These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the HTML5 standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are Windows-1252 characters. [...] The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to [...] "auto-detect" [...] that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.|$|E

40|$|States collect {{survey data}} {{continuously}} {{through the year}} using a standardized questionnaire from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC receives data files from 40 states on an unscheduled basis. Monitoring each state’s data collection by importing multiple <b>ASCII</b> <b>files,</b> converting <b>ASCII</b> <b>files</b> into SAS data sets, and compiling the SAS data sets for processing can be extremely time consuming and challenging for a SAS programmer. In this paper, we discuss a solution to automatically read 1 - 12 <b>ASCII</b> <b>files</b> from 40 state’s folders on a network drive, convert multiple <b>ASCII</b> <b>files</b> to SAS data sets, and merge all of the SAS data sets into one aggregate SAS data set. We used Base SAS, the SAS macro language, and the Microsoft Windows operating system for the entire process. This method {{can be applied to}} other state-based survey data processing to efficiently control survey data quality...|$|R
