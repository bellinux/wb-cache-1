5000|$|At {{the same}} time the land {{operation}} was concluding, a water clearance operation called [...] "Nimbus Moon (Water)" [...] was underway. It continued to run until the end of 1974and, at a much reduced rate, on into 1975. In [...] ""Nimbus Moon (Water)", U.S. Navy EOD divers were to provide both diving and explosives training to Egyptian Navymen. While the Americans were prohibited from actual ordnance operations, they accompanied the Egyptians in the diving boats, serving as on-scene advisors. The canal was searched from bank to bank by an American sonar installed in a Suez Canal Authority pilot boat. Linked with a precise radio navigation system, the sonar made highly accurate charts of the canal bottom. These charts were given to the diving advisors, who directed the Egyptians in systematic investigations of likely ordnance contacts. The ordnance that was discovered, ranging from hand grenades to 907 kg bombs, was usually destroyed in place with explosive charges. Non-ordnance items, from oil drums to tanks, were marked for later removal by Egyptian police divers. Because the canal was slated for future dredging, every piece of refuse of any substantial size had to be removed. The <b>American-Egyptian</b> team completed one full sweep of the canal bottom in late November 1974.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The {{investigation}} of geology, stone implements and pottery presented below {{was performed in}} 2004 during works conducted by mixed <b>american-egyptian</b> mission at Heraconpolis archaeological site. The geological examination documents that the site was located on a dry, big delta of big wadi, coming from west into Nile Valley. This location means that while the site was functioning at phases Nagada II and III mentioned wadi did not conduct water i. e. climate was very dry. The {{investigation of}} present geological phenomena shows continuous growth of salinity of the soils at tested area. The investigation of stone implements discovered at two examined archaeological trenches confirmed the presence of various rocks, chipped flint implements as well as grinders. These objects were discovered at two depths representing various archaeological layers. Examination of pottery showed advanced technologies of preparation of ceramic mass as well as technology of firing. Data obtained from computer analyses confirm differentiation of tested ceramic masses. KEYWORDS: Nile Valley, geology, mineralogy, stone implements, pottery.

30|$|Through an <b>American-Egyptian</b> {{collaboration}} project titled “Cotton IPM {{with emphasis}} on biological control of bollworms” carried out between 1991 and 1994 directed by El-Heneidy, the role of some exotic parasitoid species, the egg parasitoid Trichogrammatoidea bactrae (N.) and the two larval parasitoids Goniozus legneri Gordh and G. pakmanus (G. Gordh & Ellington), in controlling the pink bollworm was evaluated. Mass rearing and releases of these parasitoids took place in two Governorates (Kafr El-Sheikh and Sharkia). Through an Egyptian Histological arthritis severity in recipientproject entitled “Evaluation of exotic parasitoids against the pink bollworm (PBW) P. gossypiella in cotton,” carried out between 1997 and 2000, percentage of infestation with PBW on cotton plants declined by 36 and 55 % (El-Heneidy and Abdel-Hafez 2001). The first two parasitoids have been well established and became already available in the Egyptian agro-ecosystems. Some researchers have {{made significant contributions to}} the aspect of biological control of cotton bollworms by parasitoids: Abd El-Hafez et al. (2002), Mesbah et al. (2003), El-Heneidy et al. (2004), and Hend et al. (2016), as already several mass-rearing units, governmental and private, for Trichogramma spp. have been established and distributed in most of the cotton regions in the country, as well as El-Husseini et al. (2008 a), who successfully applied T. evanescens for controlling pink and spiny bollworms in fields of organic cotton production in Egypt.|$|E
40|$|Tezin basılısı İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi Kütüphanesi'ndedir. This thesis problematizes {{resistance}} to modern imperial power. By addressing the Egyptian military as a functional group, this thesis argues {{the military is}} the indispensable guardian of the Western Matrix of control. Reviewing the Western literature on civil-military relations, the thesis concludes this literature is historically anachronistic, sociologically obsolete, and politically opaque. Beginning with the 2013 coup, this thesis argues we could not understand this coup unless we trace {{it back to the}} late 17 th and 18 th centuries. Thus, this thesis examines the genealogy of the militant functional group since its beginning after the French imperial invasion in 1798 and through four phases. First, modern disciplinary power was implanted in Egypt, and Islam was displaced as a frame of reference, together comprising the weltanschauung upheaval. From that moment Egypt entered its secular age, and its ruling elite became a mere functional group. Second, the British invasion proceeded the French mission by completely detaching Egypt from the Ottoman state and creating Egypt as a territorial space with territorialized institutions (Cromer’s automaton), in which the British created a system of secular benign nationalism. However, although the Cairo Burn signaled the failure of the colonially created state, in the third phase the American Nasser’s coup restored and reinstalled Cromer’s broken automaton, Nasser clung to the colonially created nation state as a structure for social organization, and kept trying to drive Cromer’s automaton by absolute oppression turning the Egyptians into “Misrables”. And fourth, this thesis tackled the American reorientation of Cromer’s automaton, why the secret CIA-Nasser relation turned into a blunt <b>American-Egyptian</b> strategic relation, how Egypt was militarily and economically tied to the US, the American {{role in the development of}} the officers’ republic, how this officers’ economic empire was constructed, and their functional group was established through isolation/seclusion and infiltration/ubiquity.
