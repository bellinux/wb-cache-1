5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to develop during the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming on June28 from a trough of low pressure, Amy gradually attained tropical storm status {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. A rapidly approaching trough caused Amy to turn sharply eastward before the storm took a general northeastward track. On July2, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a barometric pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg). During most of the storm's existence, Amy featured many subtropical characteristics but was not classified as such due to the proximity to land. By July4, the system moved southeast of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical.|$|E

On August 6, 2007, Yao and Ye married in a ceremony attended by close friends and family and closed to the media.

5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if <b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced the displacement of victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy– most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath of coconut plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41towns. Overall, Amy caused $30million in damage, and at least 556fatalities, though the final death toll may have been as high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history. An additional 50,000people were displaced.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon <b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> {{an intense}} and deadly {{tropical}} cyclone that struck {{areas of the}} central Philippines in December1951. Impacting the archipelago during the 1951 eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok, Amy exacerbated {{the effects of the}} volcano, greatly increasing the number of resulting deaths. The fifteenth named storm and fourteenth typhoon within the western Pacific Ocean that year, Amy developed from an area of low pressure near the Kwajalein Atoll on December3. Tracking in a general westward direction, the storm quickly intensified to reach typhoon intensity the next day. However, the typhoon's asymmetricity resulted in a fluctuation of intensity over the following few days. Afterwards, Amy intensified to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg) on December8. Over the ensuing two days, Amy moved over several islands in the central Philippines before emerging in the South China Sea on December11 as the equivalent of a minimal typhoon. Shortly after, the tropical cyclone executed a tight anticyclonic loop while oscillating in strength several times before eventually weakening and dissipating on December17, just east of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|On {{their wedding}} anniversary, Amy disappears without a trace. Therefore over time, Nick {{eventually}} becomes {{a suspect in}} her disappearance.

25|$|According to M. William Phelps, {{author of}} The Devil's Rooming House, {{investigation}} appeared {{to show that}} <b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> buying the arsenic to kill large numbers of rats. However, it appears {{that she did not}} buy all of the arsenic which killed her patients. The doctor and some of the patients had signed off to purchase it. The investigation pursued Dr. King because more evidence was piling up against him, but suspicions were focused back on Amy when someone suggested to clearly check all records of arsenic purchases.|$|E

25|$|Another {{survivor}} of the Satichaura Ghat massacre was Amy Horne, a 17-year-old Anglo-Indian girl. She had fallen from her boat and had been swept downstream during the riverside massacre. Soon after scrambling ashore she met up with Wheeler's youngest daughter, Margaret. The two girls hid in the undergrowth {{for a number of}} hours until they were discovered by a group of rebels. Margaret was taken away on horseback, never to be seen again (it was later rumoured that she survived and was married to a Muslim soldier) and <b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> led to a nearby village where she was taken under the protection of a Muslim rebel leader in exchange for converting to Islam.

25|$|Nick and Sharon {{decided to}} elope. However, {{on their first}} night together, Sharon pulled away from making love to Nick and finally confessed that she was raped by Matt. Nick ran to confront Matt at his apartment, only to {{discover}} Matt lying {{in a pool of}} blood having been shot. Nick's DNA was found on the gun and he was arrested. Victor hired Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and a range of attorneys to free Nick, who had to go to trial for attempted murder. Nick was found guilty and sent to jail, where he spent Christmas of 1995. However, in February 1996 he was acquitted when Amy came forward as the actual shooter after Matt tried to rape her. <b>Amy</b> <b>was</b> in seclusion after recovering from mental trauma.
