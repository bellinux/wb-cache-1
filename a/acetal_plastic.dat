40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{rise in the number of}} product {{liability}} cases involving the failure of toilet water supply line <b>acetal</b> <b>plastic</b> nuts. These nuts can fail in service, causing water leaks that result in significant property and financial losses. This study examines three possible failure modes of <b>acetal</b> <b>plastic</b> toilet water supply nuts. The three failure modes tested were all due to over load failure of the acetal nut and are as follows: (1) Overtightening of the supply line acetal nut, (2) Supply line lateral pull and, (3) Embrittled supply line lateral pull. Additionally, a “hand-tight” torque survey was conducted. The fracture surfaces and characteristics of these failure tests were examined with Stereo Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The failure modes were compared and contrasted to provide guidance in determination of cause in these investigations...|$|E

40|$|The {{optical density}} of smoke liberated by burning seven samples of {{materials}} and six commercial plastic products was studied using different light sources in a modified NBS smoke chamber. Materials included plywood, PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), PF (phenolformaldehyde), PE (polythene), PC (polycarbonate), PP (polypropene) and POM (<b>acetal).</b> The <b>plastic</b> products were a polyvinylchloride pipe, an unplasticized polyvinylchloride pipe, a telephone casing, an insulator, an electrical fitting and floor tiles. Light sources used were a helium-neon laser, a mercury lamp, a sodium lamp and a tungsten filament lamp.

40|$|Abstract Background In peri- or {{intra-articular}} fractures of the tibia or femur, {{the presence}} of short metaphyseal bone fragments may make the application of an Ilizarov external fixator (IEF) challenging. In such cases, {{it may be necessary}} to bridge the adjacent joint in order to ensure stable fixation. The twin-ring (TR) module of circular external fixation is proposed as an alternative method that avoids joint bridging, without compromising stability of fixation. The aim of this study is to present the experimental tests performed to compare the biomechanical characteristics of the single- and TR IEF modules. The clinical application of the TR module in select patients is also presented and the merits of this technique are discussed. Methods In this experimental study, the passive stiffness and stability of the single-ring (SR) and twin-ring (TR) IEF modules were tested under axial and shear loading conditions. In each module, two perpendicular wires on the upper surface and another two wires on the lower surface of the rings were used for fixation of the rings on <b>plastic</b> <b>acetal</b> cylinders simulating long bones. Results In axial loading, the main outcome measure was stiffness and the SR module proved stiffer than the TR. In shear loading, the main outcome measure was stability, the TR module proving more stable than the SR. Discussion The TR configuration, being stiffer in shear loading, may make joint bridging unnecessary when an IEF is applied. If it is still required, TR frames allow for an earlier discontinuation of bridging; either case is in favour of a successful final outcome. Conclusion The application of the TR module has led to satisfactory clinical outcomes and should be considered as an alternative in select trauma patients treated with an IEF. Biomechanically, the TR module possesses features which enhance fracture healing and at the same time obviate the need for bridging adjacent joints, thereby significantly reducing patient morbidity. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} heterogeneous regions on dose deposition of very high-energy electrons (VHEE) using both Geant 4 simulations and experiments performed at the CALIFES facility at CERN. Small air and <b>acetal</b> <b>plastic</b> (bone equivalent) cavities were embedded in a water phantom and irradiated with a 197 MeV electron beam. Experimentally determined transverse dose profiles were acquired using radiation sensitive EBT 3 Gafchromic films embedded in the water phantom at various depths. EBT 3 Gafchromic films {{were found to be}} a suitable dosimeter for relative dose dosimetry of VHEE beams. Simulated and measured results were found to be consistent with each other and the largest discrepancy was found to be no more than 5 %. Dose profiles of VHEE beams were found to be relatively insensitive to embedded high and low density geometries...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{combined}} experimental and simulation study of deformation-induced diffusion in compacted quasi-two-dimensional amorphous granular pillars, in which thermal fluctuations play a negligible role. The pillars, consisting of bidisperse cylindrical <b>acetal</b> <b>plastic</b> particles standing upright on a substrate, are deformed uniaxially and quasistatically by a rigid bar {{moving at a}} constant speed. The plastic flow and particle rearrangements in the pillars are characterized by computing the best-fit affine transformation strain and nonaffine displacement associated with each particle between two stages of deformation. The nonaffine displacement exhibits exponential crossover from ballistic to diffusive behavior {{with respect to the}} cumulative deviatoric strain, indicating that in athermal granular packings, the cumulative deviatoric strain plays the role of time in thermal systems and drives effective particle diffusion. We further study the size-dependent deformation of the granular pillars by simulation, and find that different-sized pillars follow self-similar shape evolution during deformation. In addition, the yield stress of the pillars increases linearly with pillar size. Formation of transient shear lines in the pillars during deformation becomes more evident as pillar size increases. The width of these elementary shear bands is about twice the diameter of a particle, and does not vary with pillar size. University of Pennsylvania.
