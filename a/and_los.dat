25|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} for signed and unsigned integer multiplication and division. These instructions source their operands from two GPRs and write their results {{to a pair}} of 32-bit registers called HI <b>and</b> <b>LO,</b> since they may execute separately from (and concurrently with) the other CPU instructions. For multiplication, the high- and low-order halves of the 64-bit product is written to HI <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> (respectively). For division, the quotient is written to <b>LO</b> <b>and</b> the remainder to HI. To access the results, a pair of instructions (Move from HI <b>and</b> Move from <b>LO)</b> is provided to copy the contents of HI or LO to a GPR. These instructions are interlocked: reads of HI <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> do not proceed past an unfinished arithmetic instruction that will write to HI <b>and</b> <b>LO.</b> Another pair of instructions (Move to HI or Move to LO) copies the contents of a GPR to HI <b>and</b> <b>LO.</b> These instructions are used to restore HI <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> to their original state after exception handling. Instructions that read HI or LO must be separated by two instructions that do not write to HI or LO.|$|R

50|$|Since the Swedish General Strike of 1909 {{the labour}} market had been characterised by {{unregulated}} conflict, with the SAF <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> {{as the main}} actors. A restrictive legal framework was discussed, but was met with critique both from the SAF <b>and</b> <b>LO.</b> After the Social democratic government's bill was rejected in parliament in 1935, negotiations started between the SAF <b>and</b> <b>LO,</b> {{which resulted in the}} Saltsjöbaden Agreement in 1938. Especially the chapters on industrial action were based largely on the previous proposals.|$|R

5|$|Cárdenas Guillén {{was arrested}} in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 2003 and extradited to the United States in 2007. While in prison in Mexico, he {{reportedly}} coordinated the Gulf Cartel <b>and</b> <b>Los</b> Zetas from his prison cell. But with his extradition, Treviño Morales's organization experienced a leadership crisis. La Compañía (The Company), a name {{used to describe the}} Gulf Cartel <b>and</b> <b>Los</b> Zetas as a conglomerate, remained in a loose cooperation until early 2010, when violence erupted between both groups. On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped Víctor Peña Mendoza (alias Concord 3), a leader of Los Zetas and close associate and friend of Treviño Morales. When he was held captive, Peña Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf Cartel, but he refused, earning a beating followed by execution, presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego.|$|E

5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros <b>and</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, <b>and</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E
