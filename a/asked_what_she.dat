The success of Between the Lines (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled Between the Lines.|$|E

In 2002, when <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> hoped to accomplish, she stated, [...] "Awareness of the plight of these people.

500|$|Monroe's screen persona {{centered}} on her blonde {{hair and the}} stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was [...] "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with double entendres {{that came to be}} known as [...] "Monroeisms". For example, when she was <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, [...] "I had the radio on". Having begun her career as a pin-up model, Monroe's hourglass figure was one of her most often noted features. Film scholar Richard Dyer has written that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and in her publicity photos often posed like a pin-up. Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body, earning her the nickname [...] "the girl with the horizontal walk".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E

2500|$|Palin {{is opposed}} to {{abortion}} in almost all cases, including rape and incest, but not if {{the life of the}} mother is endangered. In 2006, while running for governor, Palin was <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would do if her own daughter were raped and became pregnant; she responded that she would [...] "choose life." [...] She and her husband have stated that they have [...] "faith that every baby is created for a good purpose." [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would do as governor if Roe v. Wade were overturned, she responded [...] "it would not be up [...] to unilaterally ban anything. It would be up to the people of Alaska to discuss and decide how we would like our society to reflect our values." [...] Palin personally supported bills to outlaw late-term abortions and to require parental consent for underage abortions in Alaska, but rebuffed religious conservatives who wanted to legislate restrictions on abortion even though she agreed with the bills.|$|E
