40|$|Abstract—Geographic-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing {{has been}} {{discussed}} {{for more than twenty}} years. In this paper, we clarify the purpose of fitting geographic information into <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing, and further propose a new geographic-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing scheme. Our contribution lies in three aspects. First, we classify previous geographic-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing proposals into three categories. Second, we propose a new scheme: ISP-Separated Geographic-Based <b>Addressing</b> <b>and</b> Routing (ISPSG). Third, we evaluate ISPSG through simulation based on real Internet data. The experiment result shows that ISPSG shrinks Default Free Zone routing table size by 69 %- 87 %. Comparing with other proposals, ISPSG is the only one which can support Provider-Independent address, prevent inflation of inter-domain routing table, and support routing policies.

5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and {{multiplayer}} mode. The single-player mode {{consists of a}} single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct IP <b>addresses,</b> <b>and,</b> prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of Ireland, {{counties}} {{form the}} basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal <b>addresses</b> <b>and</b> by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.|$|E
40|$|The {{designers}} of communication networks are {{being challenged by}} {{the emergence of a new}} class of <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing scheme referred to as content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing. This new approach differs from traditional unicast and multicast schemes in that it performs routing based on the data being transported in a message rather than on any specialized <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing information attached to, or otherwise associated with, the message. An example of an application for content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing is an event notification service, which is a general-purpose facility for asynchronously and implicitly conveying information from generators of events to any and all parties expressing interest in those events. In order to implement content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing, we can adopt well-known and successful network architectures and protocols, provided that we understand how to map the core concepts and functionalities of content-based <b>addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing onto [...] ...|$|R

His reputed powers of memorization and recall allowed him to quickly memorize the pages of telephone directories, and recite the names, <b>addresses</b> <b>and</b> numbers therein.

5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing <b>addresses</b> <b>and</b> leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E
