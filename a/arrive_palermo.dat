But, though the Arabs of Palermo had been soothed, the Messinan Greeks had been riled by the past months and a rebellion consequently broke out in that city (on account of the criminal practices of one of Stephen's friends, Odo Quarrel). There, a mob commandeered some ships and sailed to Reggio, there to force the release of Henry of Montescaglioso. After Henry's arrival in Messina, Odo was arrested and brutally executed and all the Frenchman of the city massacred: an inglorious prélude to the more widespread Sicilian Vespers of 1282.

25|$|Prior to the Vespers, Peter III {{constructed}} and outfitted a fleet for war. When the pope {{asked why he}} needed such a great war fleet, Peter stated {{that it would be}} used against the followers of Islam along the northern coast of Africa, because he had legitimate trade interests there and needed to protect them. So when Peter received a request for help from the Sicilians he was conveniently on the north coast of Africa in Tunis, just 200 miles across the sea from the island. At first, Peter feigned indifference to the request of the Sicilians and their plight, but after several days to allow a proper showing of deference made for the pope's consumption, he took advantage of the revolt. Peter ordered his fleet to sail for Sicily, landed at Trapani on 30 August 1282. While he marched towards Palermo, his fleet followed close by the coastal road. Peter III of Aragon's involvement changed the character of the uprising from a local revolt into a European War. Peter <b>arrived</b> at <b>Palermo</b> on September 2 and initially he was received by the populace with indifference, as merely one foreign king replacing another. However, after Pope Martin made plain his orders for the populace to accept Charles, Peter promised the islanders that they would enjoy the ancient privileges they had had under the Norman king, William II of Sicily. Thereafter, he was accepted as a satisfactory second choice and was crowned by acclamation of the people at the cathedral in Palermo on September 4, thus becoming also Peter I of Sicily.|$|R

In the XIX century a lot of researchers of psychology, physics, optics, art and architecture are involved in meticulous research that could explain the reasons of colour, its alteration, the complementary compositions, the diagrams, the optical cones, its applications in the Greek and Roman culture. Thus, high-sounding names such as Thomas Young, James Clerk Maxwell, Wolfgang Goethe, Philipp Otto Runge, Michel Eugene Chevreul, Hermann Von Helmoholtz, Albert Henry Munsell are placed side by researchers of art and architecture as Schinkel, Hirtoff, von Klenze, Labrouste Durand and others. The crisis of Neoclassicism of Winckelmann, {{as a result of the}} new truth of colour of Selinunte Archaeological, contrasts with the study and use of polychromy in arts and architectures and Giuseppe Damiani Almeyda represents the architect that, more than others, in the Sicilian context, elaborates a wide repertoire of design drawings where the use of colour is strongly used consciously and mindfully thanks to the studies that were propagating in the contemporary culture of the time. The analysis of this gallery of drawings, rich and of inestimable beauty, will allow to identify what was the awareness and, therefore, the application idea of the colour in the author's thought, uncovering a cultural thinking of the time that embraces most of the contemporary architecture of the city of Palermo...|$|R

Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4–3 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3–1 to Internazionale in the final. For the 2011–12 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former Chievo boss Stefano Pioli, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows FC Thun in the Europa League third preliminary round. In a somewhat surprise move, Pioli was replaced by under-19 team coach Devis Mangia, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the Rosanero in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long-term deal at the club. A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced Bortolo Mutti. <b>Palermo</b> <b>arrived</b> 16th in that season.|$|R

In response, Hasan notified al-Mansur and asked for reinforcements. An army of 7,000 cavalry and 3,500 infantry was prepared, and under the command of the eunuch Faraj Muhaddad <b>arrived</b> at <b>Palermo</b> in June 951. A year later, in June/July, the two Fatimid commanders sailed from Sicily and invaded Calabria, attacking several towns, including Gerace and Cassano. The Byzantine troops not only failed to confront them, but withdrew to Bari, and the besieged towns preferred to ransom themselves than suffer the consequences of a sack. After Cassano, the Fatimids withdrew to their winter quarters at Messina, although al-Mansur had commanded them to remain in Italy. The Caliph sharply rebuked the commanders and ordered them to return to the Italian mainland, but this did not happen until the next spring. On 7 May 952, Hasan defeated the Byzantine army under Malakenos and Paschalios at Gerace. He then laid siege to the town and sacked Petracucca. Following the defeat at Gerace, Constantine VII sent an envoy, John Pilatos, who arranged a truce with Hasan, followed by a treaty concluded on 7 September before al-Mansur. Not only did the Byzantines agree to resume payment of tribute, but before leaving Calabria, Hasan erected a mosque at Reggio and had the Byzantines swear to respect the Muslims' right to worship and call the prayer there, and that any Muslim prisoner who sought refuge there would be set free. The treaty also stipulated that [...] "as much as a single stone" [...] were removed from it, all churches in Sicily and Ifriqiya would be razed. Following the death of al-Mansur on 19 March 953, Hasan returned to Ifriqiya to present himself to the new ruler, al-Mu'izz. There he remained thereafter, retaining his position as one of the chief commanders, and as head of the Kalbid family. His post as governor in Sicily passed to his son Ahmad. This dynastic succession heralded the beginning of Kalbid rule over Sicily as Fatimid viceroys, which lasted until the civil strife and the political fragmentation of the island in the 1030s.|$|R
