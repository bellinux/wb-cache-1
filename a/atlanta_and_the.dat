However, these efforts ultimately proved to be futile. The frogs thrived in these facilities but never mated. The last female died in 2009 in the Atlanta Botanical Garden.|$|E

5|$|The fall of <b>Atlanta</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} the overall Atlanta Campaign were {{extensively}} covered by Northern newspapers, and were a boon to Northern morale and to President Lincoln's political standing. The 1864 election was between General George B. McClellan and Abraham Lincoln. McClellan ran a conflicted campaign - McClellan was a Unionist who advocated continuing the war until {{the defeat of the}} Confederacy, but the Democratic platform included calls for negotiations with the Confederacy on the subject of a potential truce. The capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated showed that a successful conclusion of the war was in sight, weakening support for a truce. Lincoln was reelected by a comfortable margin, with 212 out of 233 electoral votes.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{team member}} was Amanda Carter, aged 48, who {{was coming back}} for a fourth Paralympic games having competed in the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, the 1996 Summer Paralympics in <b>Atlanta</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, at which she had been sidelined by a {{crippling}} elbow injury. She returned to the Gliders' lineup in 2009. The youngest, who had not even been born when Carter had played in Barcelona, was 19-year-old Amber Merritt. British-born Merritt was originally a swimmer, but had been recruited into basketball by the Paralympic Hall of Fame coach Frank Ponta. Merritt had averaged 20 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the Gliders' World Challenge series against Japan, Germany and China in Sydney in July 2012, including a game against Germany in which she scored 21 points and eight rebounds. Another young player from whom much was hoped was Cobi Crispin, who had been named Australian Women’s Wheelchair Basketball International Player of the Year in 2011, and had since posted impressive performances in the May 2012 Paralympic World Cup in Manchester and the Gliders World Challenge.|$|E

25|$|The Union's key {{strategist}} and tactician in the West was Ulysses S.

Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the Third Battle of Chattanooga, driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to <b>Atlanta</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heart of the Confederacy.|$|E
25|$|Despite listing 12 grapplers {{that she}} would work with, Wolfe used his {{influence}} to get her frozen from NWA members. The result was that her run in the Southeast with Cowboy Luttrall and Paul Jones in 1954 fizzled. Adding insult to injury, Burke wrestled Wolfe’s daughter-in-law June Byers. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in <b>Atlanta</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> match was a shoot. By having the local commission in his corner, Wolfe slid a friendly referee into the match. Despite giving up the first fall {{with the intention of}} competing stronger in the second, Burke never had the opportunity. Officials called the match, and the second fall never had a finish.|$|E
25|$|In his {{successful}} Tullahoma Campaign {{in the summer}} of 1863, Rosecrans moved southeast from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, outmaneuvering Bragg and forcing him to abandon Middle Tennessee and withdraw to the city of Chattanooga, suffering only 569 Union casualties along the way. General-in-chief Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck and President Abraham Lincoln were insistent that Rosecrans move quickly to take Chattanooga. Seizing the city would open the door for the Union to advance toward <b>Atlanta</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heartland of the South. Chattanooga was a vital rail hub (with lines going north toward Nashville and Knoxville and south toward Atlanta), and an important manufacturing center for the production of iron and coke, located on the navigable Tennessee River. Situated between Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Raccoon Mountain, and Stringer's Ridge, Chattanooga occupied an important, defensible position.|$|E

25|$|Many {{groups and}} leaders, {{including}} prominent Protestant ministers such as Reinhold Niebuhr in Detroit, {{spoke out against}} the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish Anti-Defamation League was formed in the early 20th century in response to attacks on Jewish Americans, including the lynching of Leo Frank in <b>Atlanta,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Klan's campaign to prohibit private schools (which was chiefly aimed at Catholic parochial schools). Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan's secrecy. After one civic group in Indiana began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid {{decline in the number}} of Klan members. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People launched public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly.|$|E
25|$|The musical dramatizes the 1913 {{trial of}} Jewish factory manager Leo Frank, {{who was accused}} and convicted of raping and murdering a thirteen-year-old employee, Mary Phagan. The trial, sensationalized by the media, aroused antisemitic {{tensions}} in <b>Atlanta</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Georgia. When Frank's death sentence was commuted {{to life in prison}} by the departing Governor of Georgia, John M. Slaton due to his detailed review of over 10,000 pages of testimony and possible problems with the trial, Leo Frank was transferred to a prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where a lynching party seized and kidnapped him. Frank was taken to Phagan's hometown of Marietta, Georgia, and he was hanged from an oak tree. The events surrounding the investigation and trial led to two groups emerging: the revival of the defunct KKK and the birth of the Jewish Civil Rights organization, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).|$|E
