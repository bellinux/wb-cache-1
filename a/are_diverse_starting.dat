It is an acute systemic infection caused by Salmonella typhi. The clinical symptoms of the disease <b>are</b> extremely <b>diverse,</b> <b>starting</b> from the mild form to severe ones with the most feared complication being perforation within the small intestine. Therefore, {{it is important to}} perform isolation, characterization, and grouping of S. typhi strains from the blood culture in order to determined definitely diagnosis and the different phenotypic characteristics in the community. Isolation was done in selective and differential media: BacT/ALERT FA culture media, Selenite Cystine Broth, Chromocult Coliform Agar, MacConkey Agar, andSalmonella Shigella Agar. The typical colony of Salmonella was confirmed on Triple Sugar Iron Agar, Urea agar, and L-Lysinedecarboxylation media.

40|$|Background and Objective: Candidiasis is {{a common}} {{opportunistic}} infection in HIV-infected patients. The spectrum of Candida infection <b>is</b> <b>diverse,</b> <b>starting</b> from asymptomatic colonization to pathogenicforms. The low absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor {{for the development of}} Oropharyngeal Candidiasis and current guidelines suggest increased risk once CD 4 + T lymphocyte counts fall below 200 cells/μL. Gradual emergence of non-albicans Candida species as a cause of refractory mucosal and invasive Candidiasis, particularly in patients with advanced immunosuppression and problem of resistance to azoles and other antifungal agents in the Candida species is a point of concern. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out over a period of 2 years (2010 - 2011) on patients suffering from AIDS for the presence of Candida infection. After thorough clinical examination relevant specimens were collected and processed specifically to ascertain Candida infection. Speciation of Candida isolates and antifungal sensitivity testing was also done. The CD 4 cell counts of all the patients were estimated and correlated with the presence (or absence) of candidiasis. Results: Out of a total of 165 HIV positive patients, a definitive diagnosis of candidiasis was made in 80 patients. Candida albicans was the most common yeast isolated. Patients with candidiasis had CD 4 counts less than 200 cells/mm 3. Maximum resistance was seen with fluconazole while no resistance was seen with voriconazole. Conclusion: The most common opportunistic fungal infection in HIV positive patients is candidiasis, affecting the mucocutaneous system mainly but the invasive form is also common. Resistance to azoles and other antifungal agents in the Candida species is a point of concern...|$|R

Jocelyn's interest {{in protecting the}} marine environment prompted her to undertake a Ph.D. investigating pollutant impacts on water quality and plankton ecology. Soon after, {{she moved to the}} United Kingdom to travel and take up a postdoctoral position at the University of Plymouth. It was here that Jocelyn gained skills in developing catchment models and decision support systems to help identify and quantify sources of diffuse pollution. The modelling approaches that she developed were subsequently used for the European Commission Sixth Framework Programme on European Lifestyles and impacts on Marine Ecosystems (ELME). The objective of ELME was to integrate existing knowledge of environmental state changes, sectoral pressures and social and economic drivers into a common modelling platform to inform decisions and policies in the United Kingdom and Europe.|$|R

However, he was rapidly turned off by the academicism of the teaching. He preferred to spend his time in the National Museums of Paris where he took many notes and made many sketches and drawings. In 1908, he received a grant from the City of Paris to attend the Ecole des Arts Décoratifs. At that school he received a solid technical formation and trained his eye and his hand while searching for his own style. After he sold his first canvases, he went on a journey to the south of France, which proved to be a form of revelation whose enchantment would last all his life.|$|R

40|$|The {{actions and}} {{biological}} {{effects of radiation}} <b>are</b> <b>diverse</b> and complex, <b>starting</b> from the early stages when radiation energy is deposited into the biological systems and DNA damage is induced, and continuing into the late stages when the actual health effects appear. To understand these processes comprehensively, knowledge from {{a broad range of}} fields will be needed, including physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. Ultimate biological consequences of radiation exposure depend not only on the doses, dose rates, fractionation, source and quality of radiation, but also on other factors, such as age, lifestyles, environments, tissue oxygen concentration, and genetic backgrounds that determine the repair capacity for DNA damages in each individual. Responses to the DNA damages are activated upon induction of any type of the DNA damages by radiological and non-radiological causes, and {{play a critical role in}} preventing clinically detectable adverse effects due to the DNA damages. Hereditary defects in the DNA damage responses lead to high-risk groups for radiation-induced diseases, including cancer, and in such "radiosensitive" populations, even low-dose radiation exposure can cause severe health effects. Further genetic and molecular biological approaches are needed to identify all the high-risk groups for radiation-induced diseases and to develop effective therapies for these conditions based on the radiosensitivity of each individual...|$|R
