5|$|Researchers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cleveland</b> Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Danny Greene and his {{childhood}} friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cleveland</b> docks. Meanwhile, the members are exploited by corrupt union boss, Jerry Merke {{and the leadership}} of the ILA union urges Greene to run against him. Meanwhile, Sneperger can't pay a gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia Capo John Nardi. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the union leader out of his office, and is later elected union president. He improves the working conditions at the docks while continuing his dealings with Nardi.|$|E

The Browns scored three touchdowns in the first quarter, first on an {{interception}} return by Cliff Lewis and then {{on a pair of}} passes from quarterback Otto Graham to Dean Sensanbaugher and Mac Speedie.
