40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{implement}} indirect calorimetry method to study energy metabolism of an air-breathing neotropical fish, #Hoplosternum littorale$. A closed respirometer was designed to measure the gas exchanges of this air-breathing fish in both aerial and aquatic media. The accuracy and {{the validity of the}} method were tested. The energy expenditure of fish fasted for 10 days and the involvement of energy-yielding body stores were calculated from the measurements of O 2 uptake, CO 2 output, and the nitrogen excretion of fasted <b>Atipas.</b> The average energy expenditure was 1. 58 kJ/kg/hr and endogenous lipids were the main energy purveyor.

5000|$|Tubal's {{sons are}} given {{different}} names in rabbinic sources. In Pseudo-Philo (written c. AD 70), his son's names are Phanatonova and Eteva, {{and they were}} given the land of [...] "Pheed". The later mediaeval Chronicles of Jerahmeel gives these sons' names as Fantonya and <b>Atipa,</b> and says they subdued [...] "Pahath"; elsewhere these chronicles include information derived from Jerome, identifying Tubal's descendants with Iberia and Hispania. In still another place, the Chronicles of Jerahmeel reproduces a more detailed legend taken from the earlier Josippon (c. 950): Tubal's descendants, it says, camped in Tuscany and built a city called [...] "Sabino", while the Kittim built [...] "Posomanga" [...] in neighboring Campania, with the Tiber river as the frontier between the two peoples. However, they soon went to war following the rape of the Sabines by the Kittim. This war was ended when the Kittim showed the descendants of Tubal their mutual progeny. A shorter, more garbled version of this story from Yosippon {{is also found in}} the later Book of Jasher, known from c. 1625, which additionally names Tubal's sons as Ariphi, Kesed and Taari.|$|E
40|$|Indirect {{calorimetry}} {{method was}} used to measure postprandial utilization of energy substrates by <b>atipa,</b> #Hoplosternum littorale$ (#Callichthyidae$, Siluriform). A model was adjusted to the data on respiratory exchanges and nitrogen excretion for this purpose. As for other fish species, protein was actively catabolized after feeding during the 60 hr measurement time. As long as carbohydrates were available, <b>atipa</b> was also able to use these substrates for its energy metabolism. A gradual increase of contribution of lipids was then noticed. Over a 24 hr period following the food intake, a 30 g fish catabolized 90 mg of proteins and 43 mg of carbohydrates. At the same time, the results led to a synthesis of 3. 7 mg of fat. An estimation of the increase of the global metabolism associated to food intake was obtained from integration of the exponential terms of the models. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|<b>Atipa</b> (#Hoplosternum littorale$), a {{tropical}} fish from South Africa, was starved for 50 days. Changes in whole body composition (dry matter, proteins, amino acids, minerals, fats, and energy) were studied {{in order to}} assess the utilization of such nutrients for routine metabolism. The intensity of catabolism decreased with the duration of the fast. During the first ten days the daily losses amounted to 0. 55 g. 0. 29 g. and 0. 14 g. respectively for fresh body weight, dry water, and proteins per 100 g initial body weight. During the following forty days, daily losses were on average half of the previous values. There was remarkable conservation of certain nutrients including mineral and lipid reserves and amino acids. There were two very distinct phases in energy utilization. Lipids {{played an important role in}} energy supply during the first phase but, in the long term, routine energy requirements are met mainly by proteins mobilization. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
