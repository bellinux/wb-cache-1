5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter <b>a</b> <b>axis</b> and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E

2500|$|The chital is {{the sole}} member of the genus Axis and is {{classified}} under the family Cervidae (deer). The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Earlier, Hyelaphus – comprising the Bawean deer (H. kuhli), the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis [...] ) and the hog deer (H. porcinus) – was considered a subgenus of Axis. However Hyelaphus has now been elevated to generic status a 2004 phylogenetic study showed that Hyelaphus {{is closer to the}} genus Rusa than Axis. The study showed that Axis is paraphyletic, and distant from Hyelaphus in the phylogenetic tree. The chital forms a clade with Rucervus duvaucelii (barasinga) and R. schomburgki (Schomburgk's deer). The chital diverged from the Rucervus lineage in the early Pliocene (five million years ago). A 2002 study shows that Axis shansius, followed by A. lyra, is the earliest ancestor in the <b>A.</b> <b>axis</b> lineage. Axis is no longer considered a subgenus of Cervus.|$|E

A one-way (resp. two-way) infinite path {{of which}} every finite subpath is a shortest path {{is called a}} halfaxis (resp. <b>an</b> <b>axis).</b> The following are proved: (1) Given any vertex x and any end e of Γ, there exists a halfaxis belonging to e which originates at x (thus sharpening a classical resut of D.

Verlagsgesellschaft, Leipzig, 1936); (2) every pair of distinct ends of Γ contains a pair of halfaxes whose union is <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> of Γ; (3) if H is a halfaxis and y is a vertex not on H, then some halfaxis originating at y meets H. If Γ is vertex-transitive, we prove: (4) every vertex lies on <b>an</b> <b>axis,</b> and (5) the complement of every axis has no finite component. We investigate vertex-transitive graphs having the following property: if <b>A</b> is <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> and y is a vertex not on A, then there exists <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> through y disjoint from A.

To better understand this issue, we studied suicide completers without <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> I diagnosis and compared them, on measures of psychopathology other than axis I, to normal controls and suicide cases with axis I psychopathology. METHODS: 168 suicide cases were examined {{by way of a}} psychological autopsy with the best possible informant. Sixteen cases did not meet criteria for <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> I diagnosis; each of these cases was then age and gender matched to 52 suicide completers with <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> I disorder and 110 normal controls. RESULTS:Fourteen of sixteen suicide cases without <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> I diagnosis had detectable abnormalities that were more similar to the axis I diagnosed suicide group than to a living group. Both suicide groups were similar in the total number of past suicide attempts, the total number of individuals with <b>an</b> <b>axis</b> II disorder, and similar scores on measures of impulsive-aggressive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS:These findings suggest that most of the individuals who committed suicide and appeared psychiatrically normal after a psychological autopsy may probably have an underlying psychiatric process that the psychological autopsy method, as commonly carried out, failed to detect...|$|R
