In order to obtain AIC, it suffices to get a log likelihood function and the maximum likelihood estimator. However, we can not generally derive AIC for discretely observed diffusion processes since the transition densities of diffusion processes do not commonly have explicit forms. This paper presents AIC type of information criterion for discretely observed ergodic diffusion processes. The information criterion is constructed by using an approximate log likelihood function and an <b>asymptotically</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>estimator.</b> The approximate log likelihood function {{is based on a}} result of Dacunha-Castelle and Florens-Zmirou (1986).

40|$|We {{consider}} the sparse high-dimensional linear regression model Y=Xb+ϵ where b is a sparse vector.

We propose a prior distribution for b such that the marginal posterior distribution of an individual coordinate b_i is asymptotically normal centered around an <b>asymptotically</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>estimator,</b> under the truth. Such a result gives Bayesian credible intervals that match with the confidence intervals obtained from an <b>asymptotically</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>estimator</b> for b_i.
