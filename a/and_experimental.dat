5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical <b>and</b> <b>experimental</b> physics.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine {{also offers}} the Doctor of Philosophy degree to train {{students}} as biomedical researchers and scientists. The PhD {{is available in}} six fields offered by the basic science departments: pharmacology and toxicology, molecular and cell biology, immunology, molecular pathogenesis, systems biology, <b>and</b> <b>experimental</b> and molecular medicine. Research and teaching positions at DMS and its centers and institutes are available to PhD candidates.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its time}} of development, Arena is {{in certain areas}} a {{relatively}} modern browser; because it functioned as a testbed, it saw the implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream, e.g. CSS.

5|$|The set was Haydn's first {{complete}} set of quartets since the Opus 33 set of 1781. While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption, the Opus 50 set is more serious <b>and</b> <b>experimental.</b> It is {{perhaps because of the}} Opus 50's intellectual character that other sets among Haydn's mature quartets have received more attention from performers.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Solos {{was voted}} {{one of the}} best albums of 1974 by NME critics. AllMusic called it a {{landmark}} album because of its innovative <b>and</b> <b>experimental</b> approach to guitar playing. It also attracted the attention of Brian Eno, resulting in Frith's playing guitar on two of Eno's albums, and spawned two follow-up albums, Guitar Solos 2 (1976) and Guitar Solos 3 (1979). Guitar Solos was remastered and released on CD on Frith's own record label, Fred Records, in 2002.|$|E

Baryon resonance particles are excited baryon states with short half lives and higher masses.

For the strongly decaying particles, the JP values {{are considered to be}} part of the names, as is the mass for all resonances.|$|E
