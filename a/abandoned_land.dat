5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} re-construct the {{demography}} of early Medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 inhabitants in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland.

The examination of burial sites for this period like that at Hallowhill, St Andrews indicate a life expectancy of only 26-9. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to many developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children for women. This would have meant that there were a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed. This have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop. From the formation of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land, suggest that population may have grown from half a million to a million.

25|$|To {{the north}} of the Franks, climatic {{conditions}} on the coast improved, and during the Migration Period the <b>abandoned</b> <b>land</b> was resettled again, mostly by Saxons, but also by the closely related Angles, Jutes and ancient Frisii. Many moved on to England and {{came to be known as}} Anglo-Saxons, but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians and their language as Frisian, named after the land that was once inhabited by Frisii. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast, and it is still the language most closely related to English among the living languages of continental Europe. By the seventh century a Frisian Kingdom (650–734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Utrecht as its centre of power, while Dorestad was a flourishing trading place. Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the Battle of the Boarn, the Frisians were defeated after a series of wars. With the approval of the Franks, the Anglo-Saxon missionary Willibrord converted the Frisian people to Christianity. He established the Archdiocese of Utrecht and became bishop of the Frisians. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum, in 754.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{known as}} the Three kingdoms period, the Wei and Jin eras, which {{followed}} {{the collapse of the}} Han Dynasty, saw large-scale warfare envelop China {{for the first time in}} more than 150 years. The death toll and subsequent economic damage were significant. Powerful aristocratic landowners offered shelter to displaced peasants, using their increased authority to reclaim privileges abolished during the Qin and Han. These refugees were no longer taxable by the state. During the Jin, the taxable population was 20 million; during the Han it had been 57 million. [...] Most of North China was unified by Cao Cao, who founded the Wei Dynasty (220–265), and the Jin reunified the remainder of China in 280. The centralised state weakened after losing the tax revenue of those under the protection of large landowners. Nevertheless, the economy recovered slightly under the policies of Cao Cao, who nationalised <b>abandoned</b> <b>land</b> and ordered peasants to encourage peasants to work on them, as well as re-instituting the hated iron monopoly, which would continue under Jin and the Southern Dynasties.

2500|$|Land Reform: In South Vietnam, {{especially}} in Mekong Delta, landholdings {{in rural areas}} were concentrated in small number of rich landlord families. Thus, it was urgent to implement land reform in South Vietnam. Diệm had two attempts to control {{the excesses of the}} land tenancy system by promulgating the Ordinance 2 on 28 January 1955 to reduce land rent between 15–25 percent of the average harvest and the Ordinance 7 on 5 February 1955 {{to protect the rights of}} tenants on new and <b>abandoned</b> <b>land</b> and enhancing cultivation. In October 1956, with the urge from Wolf Ladejinsky, Diệm's personal adviser on agrarian reform, Diệm promulgated a more serious ordinance on the land reform, in which he proclaimed a [...] "land to the tiller" [...] program to put a relatively high 100 hectares limit on rice land and 15 hectares for ancestral worship. However, this measure had no real effect because many landlords evaded the redistribution by transferring the property to the name of family members. Besides, during the 1946–54 war against the French Union forces, the Việt Minh had gained control of parts of southern Vietnam, initiated land reform, confiscated landlords' land and distributed it to the peasants. Additionally, the ceiling limit was more than 30 times that allowed in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and the 370,000 acres (1,500km2) of the Catholic Church's landownings in Vietnam were exempted. [...] The political, social, and economic influences of the land reform was minimal. From 1957 to 1963, only 50 percent of expropriated land was redistributed, and only 100,000 out of approximately one million tenant farmers in South Vietnam benefited from the reform.|$|E
2500|$|Poles {{arriving}} in America frequently had {{years of experience}} working in agriculture and gained a reputation as skilled farmers in the United States. Polish immigrants traveled to the Northern United States intentionally with hopes of working in industrial trades. Stereotypes casting them as [...] "farm people" [...] and economic necessities in many cases predetermined their careers, which continued them in agricultural roles. Polish immigrants to Massachusetts and Connecticut came seeking jobs in New England's mills, but the local American population in Connecticut River Valley was actively seeking those jobs and effectively opened agricultural opportunities for them. In New England, Poles came and used land that had been abandoned by Yankee farmers. Poles had even higher crop yields than the local Americans because of their labor-intensive efforts and willingness to try lands previously disregarded as worthless. Poles succeeded rapidly; in Northampton in 1905, Poles were 4.9% {{of the population and}} owned 5.2% of the farmland. By 1930, they made up 7.1% of the town and owned 89.2% of the farmland. The Polish farmers' success is due to their large families, where children helped in agriculture, and their long hours of work, as many spent hours clearing <b>abandoned</b> <b>land</b> after a full day's work. Louis Adamic in A Nation of Nations wrote that Poles [...] "restored hundreds of thousands of apparently hopeless acres to productivity". Lenders viewed Polish immigrants as low credit risks because of their thrift, work ethic, and honesty. Polish immigrants were said to embody [...] "immigrant Puritanism", demonstrating economic puritanism better than the original New Englanders.

30|$|<b>Abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> covered 39 % of {{the study}} area and not less than 72 % of these were {{affected}} by grass fires, happening mainly between 1998 and 2014. Man causes the ignition of the field layer accidentally, but the area over which the fire spreads is determined by climatic factors and the presence of flammable material (dry grass and litter) for burning. High March temperatures and low precipitation values in April increase the inflammability of dry grasses which are abundant on the former fields. As a result, burnt areas are steadily expanding in <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> where trees are scarce. On <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> that were either affected or unaffected by fires, two different plant communities developed, respectively: grassy vegetation mainly dominated by Calamagrostis epigeios and young forest of pioneer trees with high crown coverage.

40|$|Colonization of <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> by woody {{vegetation}} {{may be a}} great opportunity for ecosystem recovery given the current and future trend of land abandonment. This may help to reverse the generalized condition of ecosystem degradation of developed countries which is an urgent need. However, ecosystem recovery in <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> can be seriously limited by biotic and abiotic factors. Indentify such factors and determine the relevant spatial scales at which they operate will help to understand natural patterns of colonization of <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> and may be useful to guide restoration activities. We used Spanish juniper remnant woodlands and old fields recently colonized by the species to assess the variation in post-dispersal seed predation and environmental suitability to plant recruitment. These biotic and abiotic factors are two of the most limiting for vegetation recovery in <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands,</b> at the regional and local spatial scale. We found that recruitment was controlled by factors operating at different spatial scales in a hierarchical manner along different stages of the process. The regional scale was determinant for post-dispersal seed predation and seedling abundance which was, in turn, controlled by environmental suitability at the local spatial scale. Post-dispersal seed removal was higher in old fields than in mature woodlands, hence increasing seed limitation, a pervasive constraint for plant recruitment in <b>abandoned</b> <b>lands.</b> Environmental suitability for plant recruitment did not decrease as a result of previous farming uses at the regional scale, a common pattern in areas not subjected to intensive farming practices. <b>Abandoned</b> <b>lands</b> in Mediterranean areas seem to have a strong potential for ecosystem recovery being the biotic factors (e. g. seed availability) more limiting than the abiotic ones when non-intensive farming practices have been performed. This together with predictions of increase in land abandonment in low productive areas makes old fields especially relevant from an ecosystem recovery perspective. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.
