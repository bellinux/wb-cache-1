5|$|Alan Kotok {{was born}} in 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised as an only child in Vineland, New Jersey. During his childhood, he played with tools in his father's {{hardware}} store and learned model railroading. He was a precocious child, skipping two grades at high school, and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aged 16. Although his interest in computers began at Vineland High School, his first practical experience of computing came at MIT; there he developed <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of working late at night when more computer time was available.|$|E

A case of a small tiger snake being eaten has also been reported.

5|$|Jerry Orbach as Lumière – The kind-hearted but rebellious valet of the Beast's, who {{has been}} {{transformed}} into a candlestick. He has <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of disobeying his master's strict rules, sometimes causing tension between them, but the Beast often turns to him for advice. He is depicted as flirtatious, as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle. A running gag throughout the movie is Lumière burning Cogsworth. Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumière.|$|E

He made <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.|$|E

5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one.

5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy is considerable. She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E

Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{eventually}} bowled England out for 441, {{leaving them}} {{a target of}} 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.|$|E
5|$|Browne {{learned to}} ride a bicycle {{at the age of}} four, but did not enter his first formal cycling {{competition}} until the age of 16, when he joined the Hawthorne Amateur Cycling Club. Browne made <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of riding to training with his ordinary bike with heavy wheels to the club, carrying the lighter racing tyres on his back and changing his tyres upon his arrival. He earned extra money to fund a bicycle upgrade by working as a newspaper boy. There was little formal coaching at the club, and the cyclists learned by individual application and by watching and copying others. Browne and his club-mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Led Zeppelin {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E
40|$|This paper envisages whether <b>an</b> {{external}} <b>habit</b> {{effect can}} produce indeterminate equilibrium paths thereby generating endogenous investment fluctuations. In an otherwise standard {{optimal growth model}} with leisure, we find that <b>an</b> external <b>habit</b> effect can cause endogenous investment fluctuations if there is <b>a</b> proper <b>habit</b> effect together with a proper intertemporal elasticity of substitution. In a calibrated version of the model, we find that endogenous investment fluctuations are plausible when the habit effect is negative with the "catching up with the Joneses"effect. catching up with the Joneses, habit, indeterminacy, one-sector growth model...|$|R

Set some time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on aiding the character Lucia in defeating Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and seeks to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping, but the gate closes behind him and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads even deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher had <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, {{and that he was}} easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
