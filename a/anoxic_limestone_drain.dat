40|$|Passive {{treatment}} of mine water uses {{chemical and biological}} processes to decrease metal concentrations and neutralize acidity. Compared to conventional chemical treatment, passive methods generally require more land area, but use less costly reagents, and require less operational attention and maintenance. Currently, the three most common types of passive technologies are aerobic ponds and wetlands, <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drains</b> (ALDs), and reducing and alkalinity-producing systems (RAPS). Aerobic wetlands promote mixed oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, and are effective when the raw mine water is net alkaline. <b>Anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drains</b> generate bicarbonate alkalinity {{and can be used}} to convert water that is net acidic into netalkaline water for treatment in aerobic ponds and wetlands. RAPS promote reducing conditions and limestone dissolution. They extend the concept of ALDs by pre-treating the water before it contacts the limestone, to eliminate dissolved oxygen and reduce dissolved ferric iron to ferrous iron. These systems can generally be used to treat more acidic water than ALDs, and can better treat water with significant aluminum concentrations. In passive treatment systems, rates of metal and acidity removal and alkalinity generation have been developed empirically. Aerobic wetlands remove iron from alkaline water at rates of 10 to 20 g m & 2 d & 1. <b>Anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drains</b> add 150 to 300 mg/L of alkalinity in about 15 hours of contact, imparting 5 to 20 mg/L of alkalinity per hour of contact. Reducing and alkalinityproducing systems add 15 to 60 g m & 2 d & 1 of alkalinity, depending on influent water quality and contact time. Selection and sizing criteria for the design of passive treatment systems are presented in this report...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} pilot-scale tests were {{conducted}} with a continuous system composed of a stirring tank reactor, settling tank, and sand filter. In order to treat acidic drainage from a Pb-Zn mine containing high levels of heavy metals, the potential use of coal-mine drainage sludge (CMDS) was examined. The pilot-scale tests showed that CMDS could effectively neutralize the acidic drainage due to its high alkalinity production. A previous study revealed that calcite and goethite contained in CMDS contributed to dissolutive coprecipitation and complexation with heavy metals. The continuous system not only has high removal efficiencies (97. 2 - 99. 8), but also large total rate constants (K total, 0. 21 - 10. 18 h - 1) for all heavy metals.

Passive treatment methods can be grouped into about nine categories, including aerobic and anaerobic wetlands, ponds, <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drains</b> (ALD), ALD-wetland systems, open limestone channels (OLC), vertical flow wetlands (VFW), and limestone and slag leach beds (LSB and SLB). We evaluated the performance of these methods by studying 137 treatment units in the midwest and eastern U. S.

Performance was normalized according to construction cost, projected service life and tons of acid load treated and dimensioned as $/tons of acid load treated/year. These costs were then compared to those of chemical treatment. Sites that achieved acid load reductions at costs below those of chemical treatment were considered successful. The results indicated a high success rate for several passive treatment methods (SLB, LSB, ALD, and OLC), while others were not so successful. While it appears that passive systems are effective for AMD treatment, improved reliability and efficiency are needed.

40|$|Bellvue Mine is an {{abandoned}} coal mine on the West Coast of the South Island which discharges severe acid mine drainage (AMD) into the nearby Cannel Creek. This site {{is unique in}} that iron is in a ferrous or reduced form {{at the mouth of}} the mine, but due to the slope of the site, the AMD becomes aerated and subsequently the iron oxidises into ferric form as it moves downstream. Research was conducted to examine the geochemistry of the AMD at the site and investigate the performance of selected passive treatment systems at this site, with a view to informing decisions for passive treatment at other comparable mines on the West Coast. A range of small-scale trial passive remediation systems were installed, including an <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> (ALD), a bioreactor, and two mussel shell reactors. Results from the trials showed that the mussel shell reactor treating oxidised water was the most effective at reducing the concentration of dissolved metals in the AMD.

40|$|The Williams Brothers Mine {{is located}} in Mariposa County, California. Surface waters from the site drain into the south fork of the Merced River and the San Joaquin River Basin. The mine was {{developed}} in the 1980 s and mined intermittently until 1996. In 1998, concerns of acidic drainage at the site arose. Effluent sampling by Engineering Remediation Resources Group (ERRG) found acid mine drainage (AMD) characterized by a pH of 3. 9, sulphate concentrations of 100 mg/L and low metal concentrations of 0. 074, 4. 60, 1. 23, 0. 047 and 0. 133 mg/L for Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn, respectively.

40|$|Acidic {{drainage}} {{from the}} inactive Copper Bluff mine cascades {{down a steep}} embankment into the Trinity River, on the Hoopa Valley Reservation in northern California. The Copper Bluff mine produced about 100, 000 tons of sulfide-bearing copper-zinc-gold-silver ore during 1957 – 1962. This report summarizes {{the results of a}} water-resources investigation begun by the U. S. Geological Survey in 1994 with the overall objective of gathering sufficient geochemical, hydrologic, and geologic information so that a sound remediation strategy for the Copper Bluff mine could be selected and implemented by the Hoopa Valley Tribe. This study had the following specific objectives: (1) monitor {{the quality and quantity of}} the mine discharge, (2) determine seasonal variability of metal concentrations and loads, (3) map and sample the underground mine workings to determine sources of flow and suitability of mine plugging options, and (4) analyze the likely consequences of various remediation and treatment options. Analysis of weekly water samples of adit discharge over parts of two wet seasons (January to July 1995 and October 1995 to May 1996) shows that dissolved copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations (in samples filtered with 0. 20 -micrometer membranes) varied systematically in a seasonal pattern. Metal concentrations increased dramatically in response to the first increase in discharge, or first flush, early in the wet season. The value of Zn/Cu in the adit discharge exhibited systematic seasonal variations; an annual Zn/Cu cycle was observed, beginning with values between 3 and 5 during the main part of the wet season, rising to values between 6 and 10 during the period of lowest discharge late in the dry season, and then dropping dramatically to values less than 3 during the firstflush period. Values of pH were fairly constant in the range of 3. 1 to 3. 8 throughout the wet season and into the beginning of the dry season, but rose to values between 4. 5 and 5. 6 during the period of lowest discharge, from October to early December 1995. Underground reconnaissance was conducted once during dry-season conditions (September 1995) and twice during wet-season conditions (March 1995 and March 1996). The main tunnel was accessed to a distance of about 600 feet from the portal entrance. Water samples were collected at nine locations along the floor of the main tunnel and from several ore shoots to evaluate the contributions of water and dissolved constituents from different portions of the mine. Values of pH ranged from 2. 5 to 6. 4 at different underground locations, concentrations of copper ranged from 0. 020 to 44 mg/L (milligram per liter), zinc from 6. 3 to 160 mg/L, and cadmium from 0. 010 to 0. 47 mg/L. Discharge from the ore shoots ranged from less than 1 gallon per minute to more than 30 gallons per minute and was always a small component of the total mine flow compared with the tunnel floor drainage. During March 1996, the main flow originated in the northernmost portion of the underground workings (inaccessible) and mixed with an unknown quantity of water upwelling from flooded lower workings. High-water marks observed on the tunnel walls indicate that past blockages impounded more than 100, 000 gallons of water. Sudden release of a large volume of metal-rich water could have serious effects on fish and other aquatic resources in the Trinity River. Because of the hydrogeologic setting, mine plugging is not likely to offer an effective longterm solution to the problem of acid mine drainage at the Copper Bluff mine. The underground workings are close to a state highway and underlie a 500 -foot-high bluff with highly fractured rocks that seep during the wet season. Total plugging likely would result in additional uncontrolled seepage and could potentially destabilize the highway. Partial plugging to restrict flow during periods of highest discharge may provide benefits in terms of reduced risk of catastrophic release without the additional risks associated with total plugging. Passive water treatment methods such as wetlands or <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drains</b> are unlikely to succeed at the Copper Bluff mine because of the lack of available space. A covered conveyance for the discharge directly from the mine portal to the Trinity River is a low-cost remedial alternative that would not reduce metal loadings to the Trinity River, but would reduce pathways of metal exposure to humans and wildlife. Lime neutralization or innovative, active water treatment methods such as bioreactors represent high-cost remedial alternatives that likely would be successful if sufficient resources were available for adequate design, testing, construction, long-term maintenance, and sludge disposal...|$|R

Coupled with data on the average flow rate and acidity concentration of the tested AMD, the cubitainer rate data can be used to estimate the long-term performance and minimum effective size of a limestone bed in an <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> (ALD) or comparable system.

40|$|The {{principles}} of limestone drain {{systems that are}} commonly used to passively remediate acid rock drainage have been adapted and modified for remediation of acidic and metal-rich drainage that is produced from broad scale agricultural land use of regions underlain by Acid Sulfate Soils (ASS). The acidic drainage water from sugar cane fields in an ASS catchment was collected from an open drain, filtered to reduce the transport of large particulates, and passed vertically through a polyethylene tank, which was filled with limestone aggregates (less than or equal 75 mm). This Closed Tank Reactor (CTR) uses the {{principles of}} oxic and <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> systems {{that are designed to}} increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and thereby the alkalinity produced from the dissolution of limestone by metal-laden influent. During a non-continuous 70 day monitoring period, the discharge from the CTR had higher pH, lower acidity and lower metal concentrations compared to the inflow. Under average flow conditions (9 lpm), similar proportions of incoming dissolved aluminium and iron (61 % and 56 % respectively) were retained within the CTR. Two perforated pipes in the base of the CTR were used to flush precipitates from the system under rapid flow conditions (> 50 lpm). The flushing was effective in removing approximately 10 % of accumulated iron but only about 0. 3 % of accumulated aluminium from the CTR. Accumulation of aluminium inside the CTR is likely to present operational problems in attempts to apply such technology to many coastal acid sulfate soil drains. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|A {{variety of}} passive and semi-passive {{treatment}} systems were constructed {{by state and}} local agencies to neutralize acidic mine drainage (AMD) and reduce the transport of dissolved metals in the upper Swatara Creek Basin in the Southern Anthracite Coalfield in eastern Pennsylvania. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} selected treatment systems installed during 1995 – 2001, the US Geological Survey collected water-quality data at upstream and downstream locations relative to each system eight or more times annually for a minimum of 3 years at each site during 1996 – 2007. Performance was normalized among treatment types by dividing the acid load removed {{by the size of the}} treatment system. For the limestone sand, open limestone channel, oxic limestone drain, <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> (ALD), and limestone diversion well treatment systems, the size was indicated by the total mass of limestone; for the aerobic wetland systems, the size was indicated by the total surface area of ponds and wetlands. Additionally, the approximate cost per tonne of acid treated over an assumed service life of 20 years was computed. On the basis of these performance metrics, the limestone sand, ALD, oxic limestone drain, and limestone diversion wells had similar ranges of acid-removal efficiency and cost efficiency. However, the open limestone channel had lower removal efficiency and higher cost per ton of acid treated. The wetlands effectively attenuated metals transport but were relatively expensive considering metrics that evaluated acid removal and cost efficiency. Although the water-quality data indicated that all treatments reduced the acidity load from AMD, the ALD was most effective at producing near-neutral pH and attenuating acidity and dissolved metals. The diversion wells were effective at removing acidity and increasing pH of downstream water and exhibited unique potential to treat moderate to high flows associated with storm flow conditions...|$|E

40|$|Mining {{activity}} {{has been the}} main support for the economy in Folldal, Hedmark, during {{more than two centuries}} due to the extraction of copper, zinc and sulfur that rebounded in the industrial and social development of the region. The depletion of the ore lead to a new direction in the activity of the village, turning into the tourism associated with the visit of the old mine and its protection to keep the original buildings, galleries and mine tailings. However, the exposure and subsequent oxidation of the mine wastes produces acid mine drainage, which is discharging into the river Folla with high concentrations of heavy metals that are toxic and trigger serious environmental damage. The absence of life in the Folla river downstream of Folldal center has been manifested by authorities and there are projects ongoing trying to find a solution and restore the aquatic conditions in Folla. Therefore, this study assesses the impact of acid mine drainage in the groundwater environment and its possible contribution to Folla river. The groundwater flow and quality was investigated integrating field data with the numerical models MODFLOW and PHREEQC in order to simulate the hydrological and geochemical observations and the effectiveness of a limestone drain as a possible remediation solution. The groundwater level in the study area shows variations, ± 1 m, through the hydrological year due to arid winters and humid summers. The hydrogeological numerical model reproduces these changes with a mean error of 1. 4 m. Heavy metals in groundwater present a concentration trend versus depth. Groundwater in the mine tailings up to 6 m deep is heavily polluted, 20 µg/L Cd, 250 µg/L Co, 1500 µg/L Cu; while at 10 m depth is HCO 32 - rich and has very low concentration of heavy metals, 0. 02 µg/L Cd, 1. 31 µg/L, Co 3 µg/L Cu. The combination of water balance and hydrochemistry indicates that currently the groundwater input of sulfate, copper and zinc into the river Folla procedding from the Folldal mine area is 2000 t/yr, 9 t/yr and 16 t/yr, respectively. This represents the 30 % of the total yearly contamination transport in Folla.

40|$|M. Sc. Water is {{essential}} to life on our planet (Miller, 1999) because no living organism can survive without it (Kupchella & Hyland, 1993). Thus there is a demand for clean, unpolluted water to be in substantial supply. There is growing awareness worldwide of the environmental legacy of coal mining activities that have been undertaken with little {{concern for the environment}} (EMCBC, 2001). Coal mining by its nature consumes, diverts and can seriously pollute water resources (Miller, 1999). Acid mine drainage is a major problem on coalmines throughout the world (Kupchella & Hyland, 1993), and South Witbank Colliery, the main focus of this study, is no exception. Various studies that have been undertaken at South Witbank Colliery have shown that the water decanting from the mine is highly acidic (pH 2 – pH 4), and as such cannot be released into the natural watercourse (streams). Some form of water treatment to nullify or neutralise the acid levels of the mine water is necessary. Currently a temporary liming plant is being utilised to treat the water and to reduce its acidity levels to between pH 5. 0 – pH 9. 5, however, this plant is seen as a limited treatment option as it does not guarantee that the acidic nature of the water will be sufficiently nullified. This study endeavours to identify and analyse a variety of permanent, long-term water treatment methods relevant to acid mine water mitigation at South Witbank Colliery. Four long-term water treatment methods, namely artificial wetlands, anoxic limestone drains, transfer of water to a water treatment plant, and construction of a permanent liming facility at South Witbank Colliery, were identified and discussed. Artificial wetland technology has not been proven for treatment on such variable pollutant loads as present in the South Witbank Colliery mine water decant. A constraint to this technology also lies in its necessity for large surface area requirements, which is restricted due to site subsidence and sinkhole formation (as a result of shallow mining). This technology is also known to increase water evaporation rates, which may result in additional water removal from an already stressed resource. The <b>anoxic</b> <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> water treatment technology is considered unsuitable for the study area, ultimately due to it having more a pre-treatment functionality than a total treatment one. It is also limited due to its ability to address only certain water quality variables. If considered for use in a partnership with other acid mine drainage water treatment technologies, its use might be more viable than when considered as a stand-alone treatment technology. Transferring of the acid mine drainage water decant from South Witbank Colliery to a water treatment plant is a feasible option. The Brugspruit Water Pollution Control Works, operated by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, is the most likely option. The water treatment would become the responsibility of DWAF, thereby ensuring that the treated water is compliant with specified water quality standards and requirements. The attractiveness of this option is that it minimizes the short and long term water management requirements for South Witbank Colliery, but is ultimately dependant on a formal contract being negotiated between the relevant parties. Construction of a permanent liming facility at South Witbank Colliery is possible and, in comparison to the current temporary liming plant, is likely to treat the water adequately so as to comply with specified water quality standards and requirements. A permanent facility would allow for more water to be treated than is currently possible at the temporary liming plant. Due to this option being based on proven technology increases its feasibility in terms of use at South Witbank Colliery. Given that water is a scarce resource in South Africa, the implementation of these water treatment options is dependent on the acceptability of each option by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. Of the four treatment options identified the latter two, namely transfer of water to a water treatment facility and construction of a permanent liming plant, are considered to be the most suitable solutions for the treatment of acid mine drainage at South Witbank Colliery...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Acid mine {{drainage}} with a pH in {{the range}} of about 2. 5 - 4 and containing radionuclides (mainly uranium and radium), heavy metals (copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, nickel, cobalt, iron, manganese), arsenic and sulphates as main pollutants were treated by means of a pilot-scale passive system consisting of an alkalizing <b>limestone</b> <b>drain,</b> a permeable reactive barrier for microbial sulphate reduction and biosorption, and a natural wetland, connected in a series. An efficient removal of the pollutants was achieved by this system, even during the cold winter months at temperatures close to 0 ˚C. Iron was removed mainly as hydroxides in the alkalizing drain and as sulphide in the permeable barrier. Uranium, non-ferrous metals and arsenic were removed mainly in the barrier {{as a result of the}} activity of the indigenous sulphate-reducing bacteria. Manganese was removed mainly as MnO 2 after the prior bacterial oxidation of the Mn 2 + ions to the tetravalent state...|$|R

This structure was the location where the body of the deceased queen would have been taken to be purified before being embalmed. The debris filling this chamber contained many fragments of stone vessels, potsherds and flint instruments. The floor is the opening of a <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> which runs downwards under the ground for a distance of 7-20 m., emptying into a large, rectangular basin. The drain is covered by arched sections of the same material, the whole forming an almost circular stone pipe.

The waters had a pH in the range of about 2. 5 – 4. 0 and contained radionuclides (U, Ra), heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn), arsenic and sulphates in concentrations usually much higher than the relevant permissible levels for waters intended for use in agriculture and/or industry. The water flow rate through the multibarrier varied in a large range (approximately from 1 to 17 m 3 / 24 h), reflecting water residence times of about 300 – 18 hours. An efficient removal of pollutants was achieved by the multibarrier during different climatic seasons, even during cold winter days at external air and water temperatures close to 0 oC. However, some essential changes in the composition and properties of the multibarrier arose during the 28 months since the start of its operation...|$|R

Untreated wastewater has harmful effects on the environment. Household wastewater or sewage may has disease-causing bacteria, infectious viruses, and household chemicals. If too much untreated sewage is released to the environment, dissolved oxygen level may drop and some species of fishes and other aquatic life may die. There are many methods and techniques involved in treating domestic wastewater.

40|$|Abstract. Limestone is {{commonly}} used for neutralization of acid mine drainage (AMD). Its main advantages are its lower price, sustained generation of alkalinity and production of low sludge volumes. Nevertheless, armouring of limestone by ferric hydroxides {{is a problem in}} oxic <b>limestone</b> <b>drains</b> and in active limestone treatment systems, reducing the efficiency of the process. Due to these disadvantages, there is a permanent search for cheaper and more effective neutralization agents. Many alkaline industrial wastes are gaining importance in the treatment of AMD. The possibilities to use two different industrial by-products, red mud from a bauxite exploitation and low grade magnesium hydroxide from a magnesite mine, as neutralizing and bacterial inhibiting agents, and the comparison with conventional limestone treatment has been studied in this paper. An AMD from Rio Tinto mine site with an initial pH of 2. 4 and a ferric concentration of 1 g/L was used. Comparative test were done percolating the AMD in a continuous form with a peristaltic pump through three different columns filled with limestone, red mud and low grade magnesite, during one month and in same conditions of flow rate and amount of each compound used to fill the columns. The evolution of pH, iron and heavy metals, sulphates and microbial populations in the percolate were monitored at different times...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{two-stage}} passive treatment {{approach was}} assessed at a bench-scale level using two Colorado Mining Influenced Waters (MIWs). The first-stage was a <b>limestone</b> <b>drain</b> {{with the purpose}} of removing iron and aluminum and mitigating the potential effects of mineral acidity. The second stage was a sulfate reducing bioreactor composed solely of 50 % corn stover and 50 % walnut shells by volume. The primary difference in the two MIWs was the concentration of zinc 5 - 7 mg/L for the National Tunnel Adit drainage (NTA) vs. 65 - 75 mg/L for the Silver Cycle Adit drainage (SCA). The limestone pretreatment columns reduced the zinc in the NTA MIW to 1 - 2 mg/L and the SCA MIW to 38 - 56 mg/L. The two SCA biocolumns had similar zinc removal but different sulfate removal with time. The sulfate reduction rate (SRR) for the SCA columns peaked at day 50 but at 0. 5 mol S/m 3 /d for column 1 and 0. 3 mol S/m 3 /d for column 2. Average SRR after day 50 was 0. 24 and 0. 13 mol S/m 3 /d for columns 1 and 2, respectively. The NTA columns (3 and 4) sustained an averaged SRR of 0. 3 mol S/m 3 /d for days 30 - 130. The effluent zinc after startup from the two systems were < 0. 1 mg/L and < 2 mg/...|$|R
