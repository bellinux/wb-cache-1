5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> {{clinical practice}} guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. For {{people with an}} international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E

5|$|Hand grenade, {{explosive}}: Before explosive grenades, incendiary grenades {{were used}} by the Eastern Roman Empire, incorporating Greek fire. Early prototypes to the modern explosive grenade, according to British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham, appear in the military book, Wujing Zongyao ("Compilation of Military Classics"), by 1044. During the Song Dynasty, weapons known as Zhen Tian Lei were created when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers and thrown at the enemy. Further descriptions and illustrations of early Chinese hand grenades <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> the Huolongjing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E
5|$|The Stretford Pageant is {{an annual}} Rose Queen festival {{held on the}} last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a {{procession}} of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> the park {{on the day of}} the pageant, such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.|$|E

5|$|The first live {{coverage}} of a Belgian sporting event occurred on 3May 1931, when journalist Gust De Muynck commentated on the football game between Belgium and the Netherlands on radio. Later, football broadcasts were also televised. As 60 per cent of Belgians speak Dutch and 40 per cent French, commentaries for the national team matches <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> both languages. The games are not broadcast in German—Belgium's third official language. During Belgium's tournament appearances in the 1980s and the early 1990s, Rik De Saedeleer crowned himself the nation's most famous football commentator with his emotional and humorous reports.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, largely {{recorded}} in Iceland from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, numerous tales {{and information about}} Thor <b>are</b> <b>provided.</b> <b>In</b> these sources, Thor bears at least fourteen names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif, is the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa, and is generally described as fierce eyed, red haired and red bearded. With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, {{and he is the}} stepfather of the god Ullr. The same sources list Thor as the son of the god Odin and the personified earth, Jörð, and by way of Odin, Thor has numerous brothers. Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (that he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the mountain-crushing hammer, Mjölnir, wears the belt Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. Thor's exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr—and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.|$|E

5|$|Security on the Delhi Metro {{is handled}} by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who have been {{guarding}} the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007. Closed-circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations, and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms. Over 3500 CISF personnel have been deployed to deal with law and order issues in the system, in addition to metal detectors, X-ray baggage inspection systems, and dog squads which are used to secure the system. About 5,200 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cover every nook and corner of each Metro station. Each of the underground stations has about 45 to 50 cameras installed while the elevated stations have about 16 to 20 cameras each. The monitoring of these cameras {{is done by the}} CISF, which is in charge of security of the Metro, as well as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Intercoms <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> each train car for emergency communication between the passengers and the train operator. Periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness of security agencies in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> <b>in</b> diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific {{ball of the}} fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E
