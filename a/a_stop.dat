5|$|Twenty-two {{amino acids}} are {{naturally}} incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, {{are incorporated into}} proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> codon. Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> codon in other organisms. This UAG codon {{is followed by a}} PYLIS downstream sequence.|$|E
30|$|If W = {W_t}_t≥ 0 is a {{measurable}} process and τ is <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> time, then {W_τ∧ t}_t≥ 0 is called <b>a</b> <b>stopped</b> process of W.|$|R
3000|$|Shift to the SQP The GA creates generations by {{selecting}} and reproducing parents until <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> criterion is met. One of the <b>stopping</b> criteria is <b>a</b> specified {{maximum number of}} generations. Another stopping strategy involves population convergence criteria. After satisfying <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> criterion, the algorithm shifts to the SQP method. The search will continue until <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> criterion is satisfied.|$|R
50|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{in particular}} {{in the study of}} stochastic processes, <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> time (also Markov time) is a specific type of “random time”: a random variable whose value is interpreted as the time at which a given stochastic process exhibits a certain behavior of interest. <b>A</b> <b>stopping</b> time is often defined by <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> rule, <b>a</b> mechanism for deciding whether to continue or <b>stop</b> <b>a</b> process {{on the basis of the}} present position and past events, and which will almost always lead to <b>a</b> decision to <b>stop</b> at some finite time.|$|R
5|$|After the Internationals broke up, Costello {{returned}} to Australia to visit {{friends and relatives}} and to recuperate after many years on the road. On {{his way back to}} the United States, Costello had <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> over in Detroit, Michigan, where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together for the rest of Costello’s life.|$|E
5|$|Aqil's victory entrenched {{his rule}} over Galilee and {{afterward}} he established stronger {{relations with the}} Europeans. After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced themselves from the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations {{with a grain of}} salt. In September 1858, Aqil was residing in Nazareth and decided not to intervene and put <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> to tribal clashes in the Jezreel Valley.|$|E
5|$|BoltBus {{expanded}} to the West Coast in May 2012 with a route in the Pacific Northwest (between Vancouver, BC, Seattle, and Portland). Service was expanded again in October 2013 with a route {{between the two}} largest metropolitan areas in California, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area (San Jose & Oakland). <b>A</b> <b>stop</b> {{in the city of}} San Francisco was added in December 2013 along with a new route between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.|$|E
40|$|Optional {{increasing}} paths {{passing through}} <b>a</b> given <b>stopping</b> point are studied. A {{characterization of the}} two extreme optional increasing paths is obtained. The past of <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> point is defined, and {{a description of the}} largest stopping point smaller than two given stopping points is given. <b>A</b> <b>stopping</b> procedure is naturally associated with this notion of infimum. Stopped martingales and stopped filtrations are studied. "Local martingales" are defined and studied along horizontal and vertical lines. A nontrivial example of "local martingale" is given.

25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>a</b> <b>stopped</b> {{martingale}} {{leads to a}} series of important theorems, including, for example, the optional stopping theorem which states that, under certain conditions, the expected value of a martingale at <b>a</b> <b>stopping</b> time is equal to its initial value.|$|R
5|$|Following Mark Warner's {{withdrawal}} from the race in October, Bayh looked to gain {{the most in the}} field of candidates. He immediately began to call former Warner supporters, hoping they would support his campaign. During a visit to New Albany, Indiana, the candidate called for the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to be enacted. Later in the month, he made <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> in Nevada to discuss senior issues with Nevada's gubernatorial candidate Dina Titus.|$|E
5|$|From 1891 to 1937, the Rainier Valley {{was served}} by the Rainier Avenue Electric Railway, an {{interurban}} railway on Rainier Avenue that traveled to Downtown Seattle, including <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> at McClellan Street {{in the vicinity of}} the modern light rail station. A failed rapid transit proposal published in 1928 by the Seattle Traffic Research Commission recommended that a future southern extension on Rainier Avenue terminate at either McClellan or Winthrop streets in Mount Baker.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Bus Lines offers limited {{intercity}} service from <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> on Water Street. Current service {{consists of two}} daily buses in each direction operating along the I-95 corridor, with transfers available to other routes in Boston, New Haven, and New York City. Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus (which no longer serves New London) previously used the former baggage and express office.|$|E

5|$|Greyhound {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{operators}} of Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach service even though the two companies are competitors in some markets. Amtrak issues rail passengers a ticket for a regularly scheduled Greyhound route that connects with their train, often with buses making <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> at the train station. These Thruway Motorcoach routes allow Amtrak to serve passengers in areas without rail service and offer passengers in areas with rail service a wider selection of destinations.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E
5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It would include <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> at Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There {{it would turn}} south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E

Occasional Great Western Railway intercity services between London and Weston-super-Mare or Taunton and Exeter also pass through non-stop.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, state {{officials}} {{released a report}} detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Four sites were analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. Niantic had previously been <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> on the Clamdigger. As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy, $750,000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic. A study will be undertaken to analyze the corridor capacity impacts that the station would bring.|$|E

5|$|In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded {{through the}} streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station prior to its {{embarkation}} for the Middle East. The battalion's voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden. The ship made <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> at Perth, where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rail service, several CTA bus routes stop at Pulaski. The 53A South Pulaski runs {{north and south}} on Pulaski Road from the station during most daytime hours. The 62 Archer, which runs 24 hours a day/7 days a week, also serves the Pulaski station through <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> on nearby Archer Avenue. The major Chicago streets Pulaski Road, 51st Street, and Archer Avenue are also accessible from the Pulaski station.|$|E
