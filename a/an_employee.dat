5|$|If <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> {{does make}} such a disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, {{providing}} that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E

The study results indicate that perceived interactional justice enlarges the breadth of <b>an</b> <b>employee’s</b> role definitions. In addition, the positive impact of interactional justice on <b>an</b> <b>employee’s</b> role definition is strong when a supervisor-subordinate dyad comprises different genders...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between employee development and their organization satisfaction, {{in an effort to}} more fully understand how employee development contributes to an agency’s success. In order to examine the empirical relationship, this study uses the 2004, 2006, and 2008 Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS) data. Based on the empirical results from the ordinary least squares regression, this study finds that all dimensions of employee development have positive and significant relationships with <b>an</b> <b>employee’s</b> perceived organization satisfaction. One of the interesting findings from the regression analysis is that the positive effect of having electronic access to learning and training programs on <b>an</b> <b>employee’s</b> perceived organization satisfaction is the lowest among those eight dimensions of employee development. Conversely, the positive effect of having a real opportunity to improve <b>an</b> <b>employee’s</b> skills on <b>an</b> <b>employee’s</b> perceived organization satisfaction is higher than effects of any other dimensions of employee development...|$|R
