After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president.

Two of the men died in prison, but the third, Milan Rajić, was returned to the NDH in early 1942 through the intervention of the German occupation forces in France, where he was later killed allegedly on Pavelić's orders.|$|E
5|$|President Richard Nixon {{reestablished}} the AMSA program <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office,</b> {{keeping with}} his administration's flexible response strategy {{that required a}} broad range of options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.|$|E

These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an ABM system as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office,</b> Mulkey {{resigned}} {{the seat}} effective December 17, 1918, and McNary was then reappointed to the Senate on December 12, 1918, and took office on December 18, {{instead of taking}} office in January, when his term {{he was elected to}} would have started. Mulkey resigned in order to give McNary a slight seniority edge over other new members of the Senate. In 1920, former adversary Stanfield defeated incumbent Democrat George Earle Chamberlain for Oregon's other Senate seat, making McNary the state's senior senator. McNary won re-election four times, in 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1942, serving in Washington, D.C., until his death.|$|E
5|$|Van Buren {{soon became}} a major target of {{criticism}} from the Whigs following the Panic of 1837. Seeking to run a non-controversial and less ideological war hero who could defeat Van Buren based on popularity, a unified Whig Party nominated Harrison over party founder Henry Clay and fellow general Winfield Scott. John Tyler of Virginia was selected as his running mate, and Harrison and Tyler defeated Van Buren in the 1840 election. At the time, he was the oldest president ever elected. However, Harrison died of pneumonia in April 1841, a month <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office.</b> Tyler then assumed the presidency, setting a major precedent.|$|E

Bc. Jiří Trunda ABSTRAKT The changeover of kindergarten culture <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> the <b>office</b> by a new director This bachelor project deals with problems of the alteration in the school culture after assuming the office of Director. The theoretical part is based on scientific literature, which explains a culture of the school, its diagnostics, the evaluation and consequent changes. The research part tries to investigate the actual situation of the school culture in the specific institution. It attempts to identify problematic factors of school culture using analysis of data {{and find out how}} to initiate a convenient process leading to alteration of school culture. The question was if it is necessary to involve employees in the process or leave this difficult task on a director. The answer to the question "How to change a school culture" is certainly very difficult, because of different conditions in each school, different people working in the school and last but not least different values and attitudes, which they share. The goal of the project was to find general methods and instruments, which a new director can use to change [...] ...|$|R

5|$|When Nixon took office, about 300 American {{soldiers}} were dying each week in Vietnam, {{and the war}} was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests against the war ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office,</b> Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and {{he was determined to}} end the war quickly. He sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office,</b> Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E
5|$|Because Helm died so soon <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office,</b> {{a special}} {{election}} {{for the remainder of}} his term was set for August 1868. Democrats held a convention in Frankfort on February 22, 1868 and nominated Stevenson to finish out Helm's term. R. Tarvin Baker, formerly Stevenson's opponent in the election for lieutenant governor, was the choice of the Republicans. The Republicans faced many disadvantages, including the national party's persecution of President Johnson and a lack of local organization in many Kentucky counties. Despite Stevenson's shortcomings as a public speaker, he was elected in a landslide—115,560 to 26,605. At the time, it was the largest majority obtained by any candidate in a Kentucky election.|$|E

5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office.</b> During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain had disliked what he {{considered}} to be an overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office,</b> Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>office</b> in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E

Catholic emancipation had now become an open question in the cabinet, and Wellesley's acceptance of the viceroyalty was believed in Ireland to herald the immediate settlement of the Catholic claims but they would remain unfulfilled.

Lord Liverpool died without having grappled with the problem.
