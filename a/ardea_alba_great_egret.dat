40|$|Canadian and U. S. federal {{wildlife}} agencies completed four decadal surveys, {{spanning the}} years 1977 to 2009, to census colonial waterbirds breeding on the Great Lakes and adjoining bodies of water. In this paper, we reports abundance, distribution, and general population trends of three species: Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), <b>Great</b> <b>Egret</b> (<b>Ardea</b> <b>alba),</b> and <b>Great</b> Blue Heron (Ardea herodias). Estimates of nest numbers ranged from approximately 4000 - 6100 for the Black-crowned Night-Heron, 250 - 1900 for the <b>Great</b> <b>Egret,</b> and 3800 - 6400 for the Great Blue Heron. Average annual rates {{of change in}} nest numbers between the first (1977) and fourth (2008) census were â' 1 % for the Black-crowned Night-Heron, + 23 % for the <b>Great</b> <b>Egret,</b> and â' 0. 27 % for the Great Blue Heron. Across the 30 -year census, Black-crowned Night-Heron estimates decreased in U. S. (â' 57 %) but increased (+ 18 %) in Canadian waters, <b>Great</b> <b>Egret</b> nests increased 1381 % in Canadian waters with a smaller, but still substantial {{increase in the number}} of nests at U. S. colonies (+ 613 %), and Great Blue Heron numbers increased 148 % in Canadian waters and 713 % in U. S. waters. Although a single factor cannot be clearly linked to changes observed in each species' distribution, hydrological variation, habitat succession, nest competition with Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and land use changes likely all contributed. Management activities should support both breeding and foraging conditions including restoration of early successional habitats and anticipate continued northward expansions in the distributions of these waterbirds...|$|R

40|$|Aeromonas hydrophila is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, facultative, {{anaerobic}} bacterium that is {{ubiquitous in}} freshwater and slightly brackish aquatic environments and infects fish, humans, reptiles, and birds.

The epidemiology of this disease has not been determined. Given that A. hydrophila infects birds, we hypothesized that fish-eating birds may serve as a reservoir for VAH and spread the pathogen by flying to uninfected ponds. <b>Great</b> <b>Egrets</b> (<b>Ardea</b> <b>alba)</b> were used in this transmission model because these wading birds frequently prey on farmed catfish. <b>Great</b> <b>Egrets</b> that were fed VAH-infected catfish shed VAH in feces demonstrating their potential to spread VAH...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Clinostomum Leidy, 1856, colloquially known as yellow grubs, are {{cosmopolitan}} parasites of piscivorous birds, freshwater snails, fish and amphibians. In the southeastern United States, piscivorous birds present a continuous challenge for producers of farm-raised catfish. Ciconiiform birds are common hosts of Clinostomum spp. in North America and are endemic on most commercial catfish operations. The <b>great</b> <b>egret</b> <b>Ardea</b> <b>alba</b> L. is an avian predator often found foraging on commercial catfish operations, but to date the trematode fauna of <b>great</b> <b>egrets</b> preying on catfish ponds remains mostly understudied.

40|$|Several {{species of}} {{fish-eating}} birds are commonly observed near aquaculture {{facilities in the}} southern United States. An understanding {{of the relationships between}} these birds and specific commodities is needed to interpret and manage bird impacts to aquacultural production. We conducted two foraging experiments to evaluate the preference o f <b>Great</b> <b>Egrets</b> (<b>Ardea</b> <b>alba)</b> for three specific size classes of Channel Catfish (Zctalurus punctatus). During six no-choice feeding trials, egrets consumed significantly more small (7. 5 - 10 cm) fingerlings than medium (13 - 18 cm) or large (23 - 23 cm) catfish. Egrets captured 19 large catfish, and ingested only two, even when no other fish were available. During two-choice trials, <b>Great</b> <b>Egrets</b> significantly preferred small fingerlings to medium-sized fish, and medium-sized catfish to large fish. Handling time was directly related to the size of catfish ingested. Handling time was inversely related to the number of catfish ingested from each size class, particularly when <b>Great</b> <b>Egrets</b> were given a choice between two catfish size classes. Thus, we infer that the ease of capture and physical defenses (e. g., catfish spines) associated with particular foods affect <b>Great</b> <b>Egret</b> foraging preferences. Management of <b>Great</b> <b>Egret</b> impacts to aquacultural production should focus on dispersing egrets from ponds containing small (3 ̆c 18 cm) Channel Catfish, rather than generalized dispersal at all ponds on all farms.
