After {{studying}} at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist in Blake Place {{was built}} by John Brown in 1843. Elim Pentecostal Church on Church Street was a public house after being used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> {{and is now a}} shop.

5|$|The Harrisburg Mitchell-Carnegie Library, {{located on}} Church Street {{south of the}} square and built with a grant from Andrew Carnegie, was built in 1908 and {{opened to the public}} in 1909. The {{building}} served the community until 2000 when the library was moved to a new building on north Main Street. During the 1937 flood, the library was used as a makeshift hospital until the water boiler burst. The building now serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} mostly used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Catholic <b>Church,</b> {{except for the}} time between World War II and the Croatian War of Independence when it was also used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Orthodox <b>Church.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Basilica of Saint Andoche, {{famous for}} its carved capitals {{depicting}} biblical stories and religious teachings, was founded <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abbey <b>church</b> in the 6th century.

Its {{imposing}} gatehouse tower was rebuilt in 1534; (its ground floor and some further foundation still remain). Malmedy began to flourish particularly in the 16th century {{with the development of}} tannery; in 1544 there were only 216 houses with a thousand inhabitants, but that more than tripled by 1635.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007 {{there are}} five church {{buildings}} in the Sycamore Historic District. When it was nominated to join the National Register there were seven church buildings within the district. One of those included is a residential structure that was utilized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> {{when it was first}} constructed; the Arthur Stark House was once home to the Sycamore Universalist Church congregation. In the time since its listing, two churches have been destroyed or demolished. The Evangelical Church of St. John was destroyed by fire in 2004 and the United Methodist Church in Sycamore is no longer extant, replaced by a modern office building. The extant churches are the Old Congregational Church, First Baptist Church, St. Peter's Church, the Universalist Church/Stark House and St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|During the {{periodic}} renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed {{additions to the}} mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets and the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and the Dome of the Rock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church,</b> but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but the mosque remains under {{the administration of the}} Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.|$|E
50|$|The large {{church was}} {{completed}} {{only in the}} middle of the 16th century. From 1580 to 1815 it was the home of a Protestant community. In 1815 it was returned to the Roman Catholics, first <b>as</b> <b>a</b> garrison <b>church,</b> then since 1842 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parish <b>church.</b>|$|R

5|$|His early {{major works}} for the voice {{included}} The Masque at Kenilworth (1864); an oratorio, The Prodigal Son (1869); and a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea (1871). He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music {{for a number of}} Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{at the age}} of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was {{admitted}} to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.|$|E
5|$|In 1857 he {{returned}} to architecture and entered into a business partnership with his sister Susannah's new husband, Isaac Luck. Mountfort's career received a fillip when he was commissioned to design the St John's Anglican church at Waikouaiti in Otago. A small timber structure in the Gothic style, it was completed on 19 December 1858 on land donated by the ex-whaler Johnny Jones. It is still in use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church,</b> the oldest such structure in southern New Zealand. Now {{within the boundaries of}} the city of Dunedin its simple pit-sawn timber interior successfully conjures a sense of spirituality.|$|E

5|$|The Leicester Square Theatre {{is based}} in nearby Leicester Place. It was {{constructed}} in 1955 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church,</b> before becoming the Notre Dame Hall, then the Cavern in the Town, a popular live music venue in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it was renamed back to the Notre Dame Hall, where the Sex Pistols played one of their first gigs at the club on 15 November 1976. It was converted into a theatre in 2002 as The Venue, and refurbished as the Leicester Square Theatre in 2008. In 2014, it began a production of a musical based on Oscar Wilde's De Profundis.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} Tiratur built a square-planned gavit (narthex) west of Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) in 1648. It functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> {{during the}} 19th century, called Surb Gevorg. To {{the west of}} the narthex was a 17th-century three-arched open-air porch; to the north was Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross); while to the south was the 17th-century Church of Surb Sion. Urartian cuneiform inscriptions were used as lintels on their western entrances.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built {{along the banks}} of the Loboc River. The coral stone church follows a {{cruciform}} plan, with a sunken pyramidal roof on its crossing. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> built by the Jesuits, exterior walls of the church have the Jesuit insignia and icons of an angel's wing and head. Major renovations were undertaken by Augustinian priest Father Aquilino Bon, including the addition of a portico to the façade (1863–1866) and re-roofing with tiles (1873). Father José Sánchez, OAR, added stone buttresses to the walls (1891–1893) and side porticoes (1895–1896). Because of frequent flooding, its wooden flooring was changed to cement tiles in 1895 and was elevated in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} originated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Methodist <b>church,</b> {{which was}} built in 1872-73. In the 1880s additions were made to it, including a tower with a broach spire. [...] The church was damaged during the First World War, and was renovated in 1925. It failed to flourish, and closed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Methodist <b>church</b> in 1950.|$|R

5|$|The glass {{industry}} in Hebron was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wooden {{church building}} was moved again in 1909 and extended in 1928 {{for use as}} a community hall. It had a kitchen extension added in 1955 and a kindergarten room in 1958. The split paling cladding was replaced with weatherboards in the 1900s. The roof was replaced with iron, probably in 1914 when the brick church was also re-roofed in iron. The interior paling lining of the old wooden church was covered with pine sheeting in the late 1930s. This building has been used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> for seven years, more than sixty years as a meeting room and community centre and more than seventy years as a day and Sunday school. After the school moved to a new building in 1929 the old building remained in use as a Sunday school.|$|E
5|$|Van der Paele {{may have}} kept the panel in his private {{chambers}} or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> altar. He donated it to the church either in 1436 or on his death in 1443; it remained there until the church was demolished in 1779. Most likely the work was situated in the nave as an accompaniment to an altar for Saints Peter and Paul and used for memorial masses for van der Paele and his family. It was installed on the main altar after the Iconoclasm of 1566.|$|E
