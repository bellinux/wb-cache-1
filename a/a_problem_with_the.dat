5|$|On 18 January, <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{computers}} aboard Mir developed {{shortly before}} fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket {{was scheduled to}} commence, about {{five and a half}} hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the computer and the station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed.|$|E

5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aerodynamics of the radiators and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|While {{performing}} a test run prior to the park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck {{near the top of}} the lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in {{at the last minute}} to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming out behind his teammate, driving {{over the white}} pit exit line in the process. This handed him a five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being stationary for more than 13 seconds due to <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came out behind Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado was racing Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado almost lost the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{received}} {{a request to}} reopen {{the investigation into the}} accident. The request was made by L. J. Coon, a retired pilot from New England who felt that the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate. Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fuel system, as well as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. <b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E

5|$|On 29 March 1944, Duke of York and {{the bulk}} of the Home Fleet left Scapa Flow to provide a support force for Convoy JW 58. The ship {{operated}} in the Arctic and as cover for carriers conducting the Goodwood series of air strikes on Tirpitz in mid to late August. In September, when she was overhauled and partially modernized at Liverpool, radar equipment and additional anti-aircraft guns were added. She was then ordered to join the British Pacific Fleet and sailed in company with her sister-ship Anson on 25 April 1945. <b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ship's electrical circuitry delayed her while she was at Malta and, as a result, she did not reach Sydney until 29 July, by which time it too late for her to take any meaningful part in hostilities against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E

5|$|The game series {{features}} {{many types}} of Tyrants {{as the result of}} several different experiments. Following the discovery of the Progenitor virus, the Umbrella Corporation’s founders become eager to create a Bio-Organic Weapon (BOW) that is both powerful and capable of following orders. Prior to the events of Resident Evil Zero, Umbrella used the Progenitor virus to create the Tyrant virus (T-virus), which they believe can be used to manufacture powerful organisms. <b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> virus’ compatibility with humans set the project back, as only humans with a very rare genetic makeup are capable of mutating into potent and manageable life forms. Umbrella eventually overcame this setback by resorting to using clones of Sergei Vladimir, one of their executives who happens to be genetically compatible.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Kansas Anderson {{continued}} horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862 Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected that the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront William C. Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day he traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. William Anderson buried his father, and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing {{that he would be}} lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.|$|E

5|$|When {{the plans}} for the British {{airborne}} operations were being discussed, Lieutenant-Colonel George Chatterton, the commander of No. 2 Wing, Glider Pilot Regiment, brought up <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> only glider then in theatre, the American Waco CG-4, known in British service as the Hadrian: its small size. The Waco's capacity was only two pilots and thirteen troops, and for cargo either a jeep or an artillery gun but not both together. The plan for Operation Ladbroke involved a coup de main assault on the Ponte Grande Bridge by the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. Using the Horsa glider, which could carry twenty-seven troops or a jeep and gun together, they could deliver a larger force at the bridge during the initial assault. Chatterton decided he needed around forty Horsas, as well as the American Wacos, for the British missions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race on Sunday, Hamilton got away slowly but was able to keep both Pérez and Räikkönen behind him while Rosberg {{retained}} the lead. Further back, Fernando Alonso made contact with Felipe Nasr and then crashed into Pastor Maldonado, who was forced to retire. Alonso needed to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive-through penalty, dropping him {{to the end of the}} field. Meanwhile, Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel made up places, sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after the first lap. Valtteri Bottas on the other hand lost positions, finding himself in tenth. Rosberg soon built a lead of over one second, giving Hamilton no chance to deploy DRS for an overtake manoeuvre. By lap 5, both Kvyat and Nasr had come into the pits for the harder compound tyre, followed by Ricciardo, Massa and Pérez one lap later. On lap seven, both Hülkenberg and Sainz Jr. made pit stops. While Hülkenberg was able to stay ahead of Massa, Sainz's stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tyre change. Another two laps later, Valtteri Bottas pitted and was sent out into the path of Button, damaging his front wing, which he needed to replace the following lap. He also received a five-second penalty to be served at his next scheduled stop. The leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven, with the order now being Rosberg ahead of Vettel, who was yet to stop, Hamilton, and Räikkönen. Romain Grosjean, who started on the harder tyres just as Vettel, was up to sixth.|$|E
5|$|By August 1977, discussions {{had been}} held with the main cast from The Original Series, {{as well as some}} of the actors who had played {{recurring}} characters. While none had been signed at the time, Roddenberry expressed confidence that they could do so with the exception of Leonard Nimoy, who had stated that he would not return to television. However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II was only for the pilot and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes that followed, which he rejected. Nimoy and Roddenberry were not on good terms, following a legal suit launched by the actor against Paramount over merchandising rights featuring his likeness; Roddenberry had refused to support Nimoy in the case. There was also <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> return of William Shatner: owing to the pay he was to receive for the pilot and the first thirteen episodes, the network wanted a contingency plan to replace him afterwards. Shatner was aware at the time that the plan was either to reduce his appearances after the initial episodes and reduce his ongoing fees, or to kill off the character permanently if he refused the pay cut. Negotiations began with Shatner on June 10, but it was not until September 12 that his return was announced.|$|E
