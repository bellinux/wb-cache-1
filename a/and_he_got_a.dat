5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lovely ovation {{from their}} supporters {{and it was}} the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} of Meyer's cricket career began after his return to England to set up Millfield School in Somerset. From the 1936 season, he {{appeared}} in Somerset matches, almost always those {{in the second half}} of the season when the school term had ended and, with rare exceptions, those played at home. In these games, he played as an all-rounder, his batting having improved significantly since his Cambridge days. Against Lancashire at Taunton in the last match of the 1936 season, he rescued Somerset from likely defeat with his maiden century, an undefeated 202, scored in 225 minutes. There is no doubt of the innings' merit– Somerset were still 48 behind with half their second innings wickets gone– but there is an oft-repeated story that the double century was obtained by an offer to contribute to the Lancashire beneficiary's fund. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> second century the following year against Sussex. As a bowler, he managed at least one five-wicket innings haul in each of the four seasons running up to the Second World War, though his bowling was an increasingly idiosyncratic mixture of spin and swing. In the war, he served in the Royal Air Force.|$|E
500|$|Tony McCoy (Don't Push It, 3rd): [...] "He ran a great {{race and}} all {{credit to the}} horse. He was off the bridle a little bit early <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little bit low {{at a couple of}} fences late on which was energy-sapping." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tuncay {{returned}} from injury {{for the game}} at Anfield and scored after 9 minutes, but a terrible error from Arca gifted Fernando Torres a goal after 28 minutes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> second a minute later. He completed his hat-trick in the second half. Downing got a goal back late in the game, but Aliadière was then sent off. This 2–3 defeat was Boro's first in all competitions since the New Year's Day fixture against Everton. Aliadière's red card was appealed against after the game, but it was dismissed and the disciplinary committee extended the ban by one game to four games as they branded the appeal [...] "frivolous", a decision which angered chairman Steve Gibson and Keith Lamb.|$|E
2500|$|... "Through some slip-up in the {{apparatus}} in Moscow, {{which was supposed}} to be bureaucratically airtight, this document of Trotsky came into the translating room of the Comintern. It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in my lap, translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones's {{performance}} as Edward R. Rooney in the 1986 film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, {{made him a}} cultural icon. Rooney, self-important and obsessed with catching the chronically truant Ferris Bueller, {{became a symbol of}} pomposity and authoritarian hatefulness. In a movie review, the New York Times characterized Jones' performance [...] "fine cartoon like ferocity", wherein his character [...] "gets scratched, bitten, attacked by ferocious dogs and covered with mud while pursuing his weaker, but craftier, prey, and emerges each time bruised but undaunted, thinking up some new (and futile) plan." [...] The review likened Jones' role as akin to that of Wile E. Coyote as a character who is fated to be unable to catch The Road Runner (Ferris Bueller). Jones expressed concern about being remembered more for this role than his Emperor Joseph II in 1984's Amadeus. He said of the movie's premise, [...] "What's amazing about Ferris Bueller, is that we're asked to, and do, sympathise with a kid whose only complaint in life is that his sister got a car for her birthday <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> computer." ...|$|E

5000|$|In February 2012, Barnsley and Port Vale {{teammate}} Marc Richards described [...] Shuker as [...] "small, nippy, tricky <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> quality right foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me, <b>he's</b> only twenty-nine.... <b>And</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> {{house in}} Cavendish Square {{and a house}} in the country. He must be very well-to-do; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> belongs to the Junior Carlton and two other clubs.... <b>And</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sister who's married to Lord Edward Lake.' Mrs Gray closed the book and held it with a finger to mark the place, like a Bible. 'It's very sad to think of the {{dissipation}} of so many members of the aristocracy. It sets such a bad example to the lower classes.' ...|$|R

5000|$|... "He {{comes from}} a very privileged but strange {{upbringing}} <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bad reputation. <b>He's</b> the ultimate opportunist and happily inhabits a very sinful, very troublesome life. He's a schemer." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} for JazzTimes Chris Kelsey says [...] "Dickey {{has a huge}} jazz {{percussion}} vocabulary. He swings in about as many ways as is possible, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> fine touch <b>and</b> big ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Paul Hathaway, my secretary. He's sensible, but too young. Stop! I don't {{know about}} that. There's no legal age necessary, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> awfully old head on him," [...] said the Mayor thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|But for {{the anxieties}} that oppressed me, I should have only {{perceived}} the humorous side of old Toller's outbreak of temper. He had chosen his time badly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> serious reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{notion of}} the old man's; he made me study languages. It's his {{ambition}} to ship the Walthew manufactures all over the world, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> footing in Cuba some time ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho!" [...] quoth the outraged officer, {{suddenly}} becoming human. His {{left hand}} removed {{itself from the}} belt, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> businesslike grip on his adversary's collar. [...] "Will you come along with me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think, Fred. Brassy never struck me as that sort of a fellow. <b>He's</b> loud-mouthed <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> big opinion of himself, and all that, but I never put him down as being crooked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{somebody}} moving below; and if the skipper sees you, you’re done. He’s <b>a</b> regular Tartar, <b>and</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> brother what’s a sergeant-major in the army. He’d give you up d’rectly if he spotted you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>he's</b> <b>a</b> sailor, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> feeling heart," [...] said Rosamond; [...] "and if {{he stands}} one look of Jenny, why, I'll disown {{him for the}} {{brother-in-law}} I take him for. By the bye, is not Raymond to know?" ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then his}} eye fell upon the {{lanterns}} and {{the can of}} kerosene oil which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> clever idea from those commonplace things.|$|E
6000|$|... "They know better," [...] {{answered}} Mrs Keswick, with a grim smile. [...] "I {{went away}} once before, and Uncle Isham hunted me up, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lesson that he'll never forget. When I {{want them to}} know where I am, I'll tell them." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{came home}} and took tea, then Mr. Granger and Elizabeth made {{ready to go to}} evening service. To Geoffrey's dismay Beatrice did the same. He had looked forward to a quiet walk with her--really this was not to be borne. Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, she was ready the first, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> word with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Teddy. [...] "By the week. Whatever he is, you can't {{get rid of}} {{him under}} the week. <b>And</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lot of luggage coming to-morrow, so he says. Let's hope it won't be stones in boxes, Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There he is now," [...] {{said the}} gratified Barker, [...] "just abreast {{of us on}} the cut-off. He started just after we did, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> horse that could have brought him into Boomville hours ago. It's just his kindness." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It wasn't {{long before}} I begin to notice {{a change in}} Jerry.

This suited Gentleman just right. What he didn't know about Woman wasn't knowledge.|$|E
60|$|Cartwright's {{face was}} inscrutable, but Lister saw the others' {{interest}} was keen. Mrs. Cartwright's {{eyes were fixed}} on him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> hint of suspense. Although Grace was very quiet, a touch of color had come to her skin, as if she felt humiliated. Mortimer's pose was stiff and his control over done. Then Cartwright turned to his step-daughter.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, {{the king}} and the princess were {{watching}} at {{the window to see}} what would Jack do {{when he got to the}} field.

[...] "There is no lie in what Jack said," [...] said the king then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Mrs. Kenton agreed. [...] "I don't {{see how she}} can {{endure the}} sight of him. He's {{handsome}} enough," [...] she added, with a woman's subjective logic.

6000|$|... ‘Let him be!’ {{said this}} man in a {{suppressed}} voice, as they struggled together on the grass. ‘Fair play! His is the build of a girl to mine, <b>and</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> weight strapped to his back besides. Let him alone. I’ll manage him.’ ...|$|R
50|$|Nearly 40 years later, when Tata Oil Mills did {{a program}} Mortal Men Immortal Melodies to {{celebrate}} {{fifty years of}} talkies in India, they invited him to re-render the song.
