5|$|Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by {{his fellow}} boys, and {{throughout}} his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> he could find. He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it. This labor {{would be used to}} good effect by Horatio Alger, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.|$|E

A 1911 version starred Marguerite Snow, a British-produced version appeared in 1916 and in 1917 Valeska Suratt appeared in a production for Fox which is lost. In 1925 a silent film of She, starring Betty Blythe, was produced with the active participation of Rider Haggard, who wrote the intertitles. The film combines elements from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> in the series.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript {{to his friend}} (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 {{on the recommendation of}} Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E

5|$|The {{first book}} printed in France, Epistolae ("Letters"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was {{published}} in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been {{the centre of the}} French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, several coming from the provinces, and the foundation of the Académie française. In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons, and was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux, and Beaumarchais.|$|E
