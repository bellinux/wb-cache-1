50|$|On February 7, 2005 Chief Blaine Commandant of the Wahta Mohawks, the Honourable Andy Scott, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and the Honourable Michael Bryant, Ontario Minister Responsible for Native Affairs {{announced}} {{the settlement of}} a land claim dating back to 1918. The settlement consisted of approximately $9.7 million in financial compensation plus 8,300 acres (3,300 hectares) of provincial Crown land, which Canada has agreed to set aside as reserve land, subject to the terms and conditions of its <b>Additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>Reserves</b> Policy. The lands {{to be transferred to}} the First Nation under the settlement are located adjacent to the existing Wahta Mohawk Territory (the Gibson Reserve). All property owners rights of access to their land, along with public roads and public access to nearby lakes, are protected under the settlement. All affected interests were consulted extensively during the negotiation process. The settlement of this claim allowed the continuation of upgrading Highway 400 to 4 lanes, giving cottagers on Gibson Lake easier access to the lake.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} price incentives {{on the availability of}} petroleum. Expected sustained higher crude oil prices to domestic producers constitute an incentive to increase both exploratory drilling and secondary and tertiary recovery of oil as well as production out of reserves. Reserve-production ratios tend to fall under high prices. Equalization of the domestic price to the real world price would make the U. S. self sufficient within a six year period. Constant prices result in no new <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> after a five year period and very low production levels. Imports reach sixty-five percent of domestic consumption.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of the national accounts treating as assets depletable resources extracted for sale, the paper examines three issues: 1. whether treating natural resources as assets when they are used requires symmetrical accounting when they enter economic reserves; 2. at what stage between existence in nature and extraction entry to reserves could be counted; and 3. how {{the value of the}} in-ground natural resource component could be determined. It suggests treating natural resources entering reserves as “imports” from the environmental account added to the capital account, registering <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> at a stage involved in economic activities, and valuing reserves by procedures related to market price. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{estimates}} of limited oil resources as constituting a constraint {{on the future}} of oil, lack validity. The issue is unimportant for the oil market for 50 years. Similarly, fears for the adequacy of annual <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> are unfounded: the world is running into oil, not out of it. By contrast, the geography of reserves development is important. Twothirds of reserves are in the Middle East, but 85 % of these are irrelevant to global production to 2010, given the potential in OECD and non-OPEC developing countries, and the maintenance of the current oil price. Thus, demand for Middle East oil will remain frustratingly modest. Efforts to expand production, necessarily in cooperation with major oil corporations, will regenerate fears elsewhere for supply security and create prospects for regionalising global oil around the three groupings of OECD countries, to which the non-Middle East OPEC members will adhere. ...|$|E
40|$|Reserve {{growth is}} {{recognized}} as {{a major component of}} <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> in most oil provinces around the world, particularly in mature provinces. It takes place {{as a result of the}} discovery of new pools/reservoirs and extensions of known pools within existing fields, improved knowledge of reservoirs over time leading to a change in estimates of original oil-in-place, and improvement in recovery factor through the application of new technology, such as enhanced oil recovery methods, horizontal/multilateral drilling, and 4 D seismic. A reserve growth study was conducted on oil pools in Alberta, Canada, with the following objectives: 1) evaluate historical oil reserve data in order to assess the potential for future reserve growth; 2) develop reserve growth models/ functions to help forecast hydrocarbon volumes; 3) study reserve growth sensitivity to various parameters (for example, pool size, porosity, and oil gravity); and 4) compare reserve growth in oil pools and fields in Alberta with those from other large petroleum provinces around the world. The reported known recoverable oil exclusive of Athabasca oil sands in Alberta increased from 4. 5 billion barrels of oil (BBO) in 1960 to 17 BBO in 2005. Some of the pools that were included in the existing database were excluded from the present study for lack of adequate data. Therefore, the known recoverable oil increased from 4. 2 to 13. 9 BBO over the period from 1960 through 2005, with new discoveries contributing 3. 7 BBO and reserve growth adding 6 BBO. Thi...|$|E

40|$|The US Geological Survey recognizes {{six major}} plays for nonassociated gas in Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous low-permeability strata of the Uinta Basin, Utah. For {{purposes}} of this study, plays without gas/water contacts are separated from those with such contacts. Continuous-saturation accumulations are essentially single fields, so large in areal extent and so heterogeneous that their development cannot be properly modeled as field growth. Fields developed in gas-saturated plays are not restricted to structural or stratigraphic traps and they are developed in any structural position where permeability conduits occur such as that provided by natural open fractures. Other fields in the basin have gas/water contacts and the rocks are water-bearing away from structural culmination`s. The plays can be assigned to two groups. Group 1 plays are those in which gas/water contacts are rare to absent and the strata are gas saturated. Group 2 plays contain reservoirs in which both gas-saturated strata and rocks with gas/water contacts seem to coexist. Most units in the basin that have received a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) designation as tight are in the main producing areas and are within Group 1 plays. Some rocks in Group 2 plays may not meet FERC requirements as tight reservoirs. However, we suggest that in the Uinta Basin that the extent of low-permeability rocks, and therefore resources, extends well {{beyond the limits of}} current FERC designated boundaries for tight reservoirs. Potential additions to gas reserves from gas-saturated tight reservoirs in the Tertiary Wasatch Formation and Cretaceous Mesaverde Group in the Uinta Basin, Utah is 10 TCF. If the potential <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> in strata in which both gas-saturated and free water-bearing rocks exist are added to those of Group 1 plays, the volume is 13 TCF...|$|E
