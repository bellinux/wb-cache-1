40|$|Bacteria <b>adhering</b> to {{surfaces}} exhibit nanoscopic vibrations {{that depend}} on the viscoelasticity of the bond. The quantification of the nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria <b>adhering</b> to surfaces provides new opportunities {{to better understand the}} properties of the bond through which bacteria <b>adhere</b> and the mechanisms by which they resist detachment. Often, however, bacteria do not <b>adhere</b> to bare surfaces but to adsorbed protein films, on which adhesion involves highly specific ligand receptor binding next to nonspecific DLVO interaction forces. Here we determine the contribution of adsorbed salivary protein and fibronectin films to vibrations exhibited by <b>adhering</b> streptococci and staphylococci, respectively. The streptococcal strain used has the ability to <b>adhere</b> to adsorbed salivary proteins films through antigen I/II ligand receptor binding, while the staphylococcal strain used <b>adheres</b> to adsorbed fibronectin films through a proteinaceous ligand receptor bond. In the absence of ligand receptor binding, electrostatic interactions had a large impact on vibration amplitudes of <b>adhering</b> bacteria on glass. On an adsorbed salivary protein film, vibration amplitudes of <b>adhering</b> streptococci depended on the film softness as determined by QCM-D and were reduced after film fixation using glutaraldehyde. On a relatively stiff fibronectin film, cross-linking the film in glutaraldehyde hardly reduced its softness, and accordingly fibronectin film softness did not contribute to vibration amplitudes of <b>adhering</b> staphylococci. However, fixation of the staphylococcus fibronectin bond further decreased vibration amplitudes, while fixation of the streptococcus bond hardly impacted vibration amplitudes. Summarizing, this study shows that both the softness of adsorbed protein films and the properties of the bond between an <b>adhering</b> bacterium and an adsorbed protein film {{play an important role in}} bacterial vibration amplitudes. These nanoscopic vibrations reflect the viscoelasticity of the bacterial bond with a substratum and play important roles in bacterial adhesion, detachment and susceptibility to antimicrobials...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBecause {{inhibition}} of integrin signaling induces apoptosis, we investigated whether keratinocytes expressing β 1 and α 6 β 4 integrins (enriched for stem cells) are protected from cell death. Keratinocytes rapidly <b>adhering</b> to type IV collagen expressed {{highest levels of}} β 1 and α 6 β 4 and of the anti-apoptotic stem cell marker p 63. Apoptotic cells were significantly higher in slowly <b>adhering</b> than in rapidly <b>adhering</b> keratinocytes.

Bax and Bad proteins were higher in slowly <b>adhering</b> than in rapidly <b>adhering</b> cells.

After addition of anti-β 1 integrin, the apoptotic rate was significantly higher in HaCaT cells not expressing Bcl- 2 than in controls. These results indicate that keratinocytes enriched for stem cells are protected from apoptosis via β 1 integrin, in a Bcl- 2 dependent manner...|$|R

40|$|The oral {{microbiome}} {{consists of}} a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an <b>adhering</b> microbiome (the biofilm <b>adhering</b> to oral hard and soft tissues). Here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and <b>adhering</b> oral microbiome on teeth {{can be related to}} the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. The relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. Analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the <b>adhering</b> oral microbiome. Next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. Species that were found predominantly in the <b>adhering</b> microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (- 0. 60 to - 1. 05 nN) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (- 0. 40 to - 0. 55 nN).
