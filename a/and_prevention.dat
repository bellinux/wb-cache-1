40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} is a behavior disorder characterized by recurrent, intense thoughts and repetitive ritualistic acts. Treatments for {{obsessive compulsive disorder}} typically consist of either exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> or pharmacotherapy. particularly benzodiazepines. Combinations of {{these two types of}} treatment could lead to three possible outcomes. First, the combination of exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> benzodiazepines may show no better results than exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> alone. Second, combination therapy may result in a better effect than exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> alone [...] the drug will decrease anxiety during exposure without increasing the relapse rate after treatment. Third, combination therapy could have worse effects than exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> alone by increasing the rate of relapse through state-dependent learning [...] Iearning occurring during the drugged state does not transfer to the non-drugged state. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of the combination of exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> with the benzodiazepine alprazolam using a single-subject design. This design alternated between exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> plus alprazolam <b>and</b> exposure <b>and</b> response <b>prevention</b> alone.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{systematic}} literature review over 12 peer reviewed articles regarding the topiccyberbullying. The {{purpose of this study}} is to summarise and critically discuss different interventions <b>and</b> <b>preventions</b> used to tackle cyberbullying in school environments. Interventions <b>and</b> <b>preventions</b> will be analysed from a relational perspective. The articles are sorted and discussed in four relevant categories. These are: Netiquette, building relationships, Learning through role models, antibullying programs. The study found that the foundation of most successful interventions against cyberbullying is healthy relationships between students and school staff. The result showed that based on meaningful relationships, successful interventions <b>and</b> <b>preventions</b> can be formed and used in school. It is important to acknowledge that not a single intervention can solve a complex problem like cyberbullying, but instead there is a need for a combination of different interventions and more knowledge about the phenomena cyberbullying...|$|R
5|$|Insurance {{coverage}} helps save lives, {{by encouraging}} early detection <b>and</b> <b>prevention</b> of dangerous medical conditions. According to a 2014 study, the ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013.

Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).
