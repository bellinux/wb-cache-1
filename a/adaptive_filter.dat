5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiberâ€“Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Filter</b> model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{different}} implementation methods, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>filtering</b> modes of data transmission system {{can be divided into}} analog <b>adaptive</b> <b>filtering</b> and digital <b>adaptive</b> <b>filtering.</b> Analog <b>adaptive</b> <b>filtering</b> technology is to add an analog filter at the front end of demodulator to adapt channel amplitude and group delay characteristic.
