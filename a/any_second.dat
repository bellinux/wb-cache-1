Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats.

The MDC declared that Tsvangirai won a narrow majority in the first round and initially refused to participate in <b>any</b> <b>second</b> round. ZANU-PF has said that Mugabe will participate in a second round; the party alleged that some electoral officials, in connection with the MDC, fraudulently reduced Mugabe's score, and as a result a recount was conducted.|$|E

With respect to major end-of-season awards, the new field contained one Cy Young Award winner (Pat Hentgen), one MVP (Larkin) and one Rookie of the Year (Eric Karros). Alomar won ten Gold Gloves {{at second base}} (the most for <b>any</b> <b>second</b> baseman). Robin Ventura received six at third base.

Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart <b>any</b> <b>second.</b> There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E

Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And I never had <b>any</b> <b>second</b> thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at <b>any</b> <b>second,</b> firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
500|$|Pre-production {{began at}} Cinecittà Studios around October 1957. The MGM Art Department {{produced}} more than 15,000 sketches and drawings of costumes, sets, props, and other items needed for the film (8,000 alone for the costumes); photostatted each item; and cross-referenced and catalogued them {{for use by the}} production design team and fabricators. More than a million props were ultimately manufactured. Construction of miniatures for the entrance of Quintus Arrius into Rome and for the sea battle were under way by the end of November 1957. MGM location scouts arrived in Rome to identify shooting locations in August 1957. Location shooting in Africa was actively under consideration, and in mid-January 1958, MGM said that filming in North Africa (later revealed to be Libya) would begin on March 1, 1958, and that 200 camels and 2,500 horses had already been procured for the studio's use there. The production was then scheduled to move to Rome on April 1, where Andrew Marton had been hired as second unit director and 72 horses were being trained for the chariot race sequence. However, the Libyan government canceled the production's film permit for religious reasons on March 11, 1958, just a week before filming was to have begun. It is unclear whether <b>any</b> <b>second</b> unit filming took place in Israel. A June 8, 1958, reported in The New York Times said second unit director Andrew Martin had roamed [...] "up and down the countryside" [...] filming footage. However, the American Film Institute claims the filming permit was revoked in Israel for religious reasons as well (although when is not clear), and no footage from the planned location shooting near Jerusalem appeared in the film.|$|E
