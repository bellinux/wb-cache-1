5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration.</b> The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E
5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustrations</b> on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers {{to boost the}} {{manpower}} of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this set off a violent reaction against the nation's 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.|$|R
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the STO, the program that required large number of young Frenchmen to work in factories for the German war industry, {{in exchange for the}} return of older and sick French prisoners of war in Germany, greatly increased the resentment of the French population against the Germans. Most Parisians, however, only expressed their <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustrations</b> in private, while the police of Paris, under German control, received every day hundreds of anonymous denunciations by Parisians against other Parisians.|$|R

Consequently, Damon's <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustrations</b> with his personal life come to the surface, and something's got to give.|$|R
25|$|Though Na Woon-gyu {{has been}} {{described}} as short, and with a toad-like face which suited him for the peasant roles he often played, the <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> he was able to project on the screen suited the situation and mood of the Korean people at the time.

The correspondence shows that Wilder sometimes adamantly refused to accept some of Lane's suggestions, {{and at other times}} gratefully accepted them. Lane's diaries show reactions to time spent on the project ranging from <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> over financial loss from lack of her own work to elation at the success of the books and the prestige and income they brought to Wilder.|$|E
25|$|A {{month after}} the rampage, {{the parents of the}} {{stabbing}} victims expressed <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> about multiple aspects of the case, including the failure of police to take preventive action before the attack, the limited amount of information that the authorities had released about their children's murders, more public interest in Rodger than in the victims, and perceived emphasis {{on the rights of the}} mentally ill over the rights of victims. On March 2, 2015, the families of the three stabbing victims filed a federal lawsuit against the county, the sheriff's department, the apartment building and the property management. The wrongful death suit alleged that the defendants failed to recognize warning signs and take action to prevent the tragedy.|$|E

25|$|Drug addiction, alcoholism, {{a mental}} disability, bio-chemical changes and PTSD can all {{lead to a}} person {{committing}} an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills {{on how to handle}} oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a negative way. Prolonged or intense <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> contributes to physical conditions such as headaches, digestive problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression. Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness, or depression.|$|E

Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother Christian Clarke (John Partridge) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration,</b> he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality.

In the days that follow, while looking at the {{underside}} of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they {{will find a way to}} move on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping in the backseat, Edward stops the car at an intersection. Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station, implying he is about to leave their car and turn himself in.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Alan Ball {{resolved}} {{to move into}} the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and Cybill. He joined the United Talent Agency, where his representative, Andrew Cannava, suggested he write a spec script to [...] "reintroduce [...] to the town as a screenwriter". Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava: two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty, which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s. Despite the story's lack of an easily marketable concept, Cannava selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion. While developing the script, Ball created another television sitcom, Oh, Grow Up. He channeled his <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> at having to accede to network demands on that show—and during his tenures on Grace Under Fire and Cybill—into writing American Beauty.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} portrays Travers as being emotionally moved during {{the premiere of}} Mary Poppins—overlaid with images of her childhood, which is implied to be {{attributed}} to her feelings about her father—co-screenwriter Kelly Marcel and several critics note that in real life, Travers' show of emotion was actually a result of <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> over the final product. Reportedly, Travers felt that in the end, the film betrayed the artistic integrity of her work and story's characters. Resentful over what she considered poor treatment {{at the hands of}} Walt Disney, Travers vowed to never permit Disney to adapt her other novels for any purpose. Travers' last will bans all American adaptation of her works to any form of media. According to the Chicago Tribune, Disney was [...] "indulging in a little revisionist history with an upbeat spin", adding, [...] "the truth was always complicated" [...] and that Travers subsequently viewed the film multiple times.|$|E

5000|$|Although hip hop in France {{has been}} greatly {{influenced}} by American hip hop culture, the lyrics remain typically in French. [...] Other than English, other language influences are based on oral traditions such as African griots, [...] "talk over" [...] of Jamaica and the blues. French music lyrics typically feature puns, play on words and suggestive phonetic combinations. Such artists as Boby Lapointe often use alliterations, onomatopoeia and puns or double entendre lyrics. The dialect of choice for many hip hop artists in France is verlan {{which is based on}} the inverse of original French words. In some cases artists rap in several different languages on a track including Arabic, French and English. The purpose of the lyrics, no matter the language, is [...] "to popularize <b>and</b> vent the <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustrations</b> of many disadvantaged and sometimes mistreated individuals, and to defend the cause of the poorest and least socially integrated segment of French society".|$|R

500|$|Bigelow was {{motivated}} to start work on Strange Days shortly {{after a series}} of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, [...] "I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> and economic disparity in which we live." [...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1985 Larkin {{instructed}} his companion Monica Jones to burn his diaries. His instructions did not cover other writings, therefore the Coleman material remained in the archives of the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin had worked as chief librarian since 1955. The existence of these papers was first made public in 1992, when Larkin's Selected Letters was published. In the following year extensive extracts from the Coleman works appeared in Motion's biography of Larkin, and became the subject of literary analysis by M. W. Rowe, in his 1999 essay [...] "Unreal Girls: Lesbian Fantasy in Early Larkin". Rowe saw Larkin's adoption of a female persona as an outlet, compensating for his sexual awkwardness and lack of success with Oxford women. The punishment scenes, in which women punish women, were a means of subduing Larkin's feelings of <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration</b> with his personal sexual failures. [...] More significantly, according to Rowe, Larkin's invention of Coleman was the catalyst which broke the writing block that had afflicted him for most of his Oxford years. The few months of her creative life in 1943 were, Larkin later acknowledged, the prelude to [...] "the intensest time of my life"; in the three subsequent years his poetry collection The North Ship and his novels Jill and A Girl in Winter were published.|$|E
500|$|Because of women's {{expanded}} {{roles in}} the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities, many women today face the [...] "double burden" [...] of home and work responsibilities. Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, {{even when they are}} working full-time jobs. This breeds <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> <b>frustration,</b> as women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers. There have been said to be more reasons, other than gender roles, as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women. Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's. Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not. Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities. In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and {{women between the ages of}} 25-54, women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women. As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift. The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.|$|E
