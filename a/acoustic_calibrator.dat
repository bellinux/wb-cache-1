40|$|The paper {{presents}} the {{accuracy and precision}} associated with realization of primary standard of sound using the reciprocity method. An experimental determination of the front cavity volume on Universal Measuring Machine has lead to reaffirmation of measurement uncertainty in pressure sensitivity determination to 0. 04 - 0. 15 dB in frequency range 31. 5 Hz to 25 kHz. The reduced measurement uncertainty has also been validated {{from the results of}} the recent APMP Key comparison and also by comparison to the manufacturer's value for LS 2 P microphones. The use of optical method for measuring the front cavity volume has refined the measurement methodology followed with adaptation of a self reliant, traceable and systematic measurement procedure in comparison to the earlier use of nominal values for sensitivity fitting exercise conducted on MP. EXE program. Consequently, the measurement uncertainty associated with the calibration of working standard microphones, multifunction <b>acoustic</b> <b>calibrator</b> and A-weighted sound pressure level measurements is also reduced...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and {{objectives}} Although exposure to audible noise has been examined in many publications, {{the sources of}} infrasound in agriculture have not been fully examined and presented. The study presents the assessment of exposure to infrasound from many sources at workplaces in agriculture with examples of possible ergonomic and health consequences caused by such exposure. Material and Methods Workers’-perceived infrasonic noise levels were examined for 118 examples of moving and stationary agricultural machines (modern and old cab-type tractors, old tractors without cabins, small tractors, grinders, chargers, forage mixers, grain cleaners, conveyors, bark sorters and combine-harvesters). Measurements of infrasound were taken {{with the use of}} class 1 instruments (digital sound analyzer DSA- 50 digital and <b>acoustic</b> <b>calibrator).</b> Noise level measurements were performed in accordance with PN-Z- 01338 : 2010, PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 and ISO 9612 : 2009. Results and conclusions The most intense sources of infrasound in the study were modern and old large size types agricultural machinery (tractors, chargers and combined-harvesters, and stationary forage mixers with ventilation). The G-weighted infrasound levels were significant and at many analyzed workplaces stayed within or exceeded the occupational exposure limit (L G eq, 8 h = 102 dB) when the duration of exposure is longer than 22 min. / 8 -hours working day (most noisy – modern cab-type tractors), 46 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – old type cab-tractors), 73 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – old tractors without cabins), 86 min. / 8 -hours working day (most noisy – combine-harvesters) and 156 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – stationary forage mixers with ventilation). All measured machines generated infrasonic noise exceeded the value L G eq, Te = 86 dB (occupational exposure limit for workplaces requiring maintained mental concentration). A very important harmful factor is infrasound exposure for pregnant women and adolescents at workplaces in agriculture. Very valuable work can be technical limiting exposure to infrasound from new and used agricultural machinery. The technical limitation of infrasound caused by both old and new agricultural machinery can be invaluable from the work point of view...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new {{principle}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>calibrators</b> design, {{based on the}} use of a microprocessor in the control loop of the calibrator, is presented. The mechanical and functional features of the calibrator using this principle are briefly described, and its technical specification is given. The applied algorithms of digital regulation loop and the coherent sampling of the reference signal are described in details. The carried-out experiments are presented as well as the results of the tests. The strong and the weak points of the selected solution in the relation to the traditional analogue techniques are pointed out.

40|$|A calibrator, {{referred}} to as the spider design, can be used to calibrate probes incorporating multiple acoustic sensing elements. The application is an acoustic energy density probe, although the calibrator can be used for other types of <b>acoustic</b> probes. The <b>calibrator</b> relies on the use of acoustic waveguide technology to produce the same acoustic field at each of the sensing elements. As a result, the sensing elements can be separated from each other, but still calibrated through use of the acoustic waveguides. Standard calibration techniques involve placement of an individual microphone into a small cavity with a known, uniform pressure to perform the calibration. If a cavity is manufactured with sufficient size to insert the energy density probe, it has been found that a uniform pressure field can only be created at very low frequencies, due {{to the size of the}} probe. The size of the energy density probe prevents one from having the same pressure at each microphone in a cavity, due to the wave effects. The "spider" design probe is effective in calibrating multiple microphones separated from each other. The spider design ensures that the same wave effects exist for each microphone, each with an indivdual sound path. The calibrator s speaker is mounted at one end of a 14 -cm-long and 4. 1 -cm diameter small plane-wave tube. This length was chosen so that the first evanescent cross mode of the plane-wave tube would be attenuated by about 90 dB, thus leaving just the plane wave at the termination plane of the tube. The tube terminates with a small, acrylic plate with five holes placed symmetrically about the axis of the speaker. Four ports are included for the four microphones on the probe. The fifth port is included for the pre-calibrated reference microphone. The ports in the acrylic plate are in turn connected to the probe sensing elements via flexible PVC tubes. These five tubes are the same length, so the acoustic wave effects are the same in each tube. The flexible nature of the tubes allows them to be positioned so that each tube terminates at one of the microphones of the energy density probe, which is mounted in the acrylic structure, or the calibrated reference microphone. Tests performed verify that the pressure did not vary due to bends in the tubes. The results of these tests indicate that the average sound pressure level in the tubes varied by only 0. 03 dB as the tubes were bent to various angles. The current calibrator design is effective up to a frequency of approximately 4. 5 kHz. This upper design frequency is largely due to the diameter of the plane-wave tubes...|$|R
40|$|In last years, several {{research}} teams pointed {{their attention on}} the application of active noise control systems (ANC) inside the cabs of agricultural tractor, {{with the purpose of}} reducing the driver exposition to noise, that is only partially controlled by the frame of the cab. This paper reports the results of a first experience that aimed at verifying the applicability of an ANC on a medium-high power, tracked tractor without cab. The tested tractor was a Fiat Allis 150 A, equipped with rear power take off, used in the execution of deep primary tillage in compact soils. It is a tracked tractor without cab, with maximum power of 108. 8 kW at 1840 min– 1 of the engine. The ANC consists of a control unit box based on a digital signal processor (DPS), two microphones, two speakers and a power amplifier. The instrumentation used in noise data collecting and processing consisted of a multichannel signal analyzer (Sinus - Soundbook), a ½” microphone capsule and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>calibrator,</b> both Bruel & Kjaer. The study aimed at evaluating the behaviour of the ANC by means of tests carried out under repeatable conditions, characterized by pre-defined engine speed values. Three replications have been made for each engine speed. The sampling time was 30 s. Two series of tests were performed in order to compare the results observed with the ANC on and off. The engine speed adopted in the study ranged from 600 min– 1, up to 2000 min– 1 (maximum speed) with steps of 100 min– 1. The ANC proved to be effective in the interval of speed between 1400 and 1700 min– 1, where the samplings have been intensified, adopting steps of 50 min– 1. In such an interval, the attenuation observed with the ANC system on appeared evident both as weighed A sound pressure level (from 1. 29 up to 2. 46 dB(A)) and linear (from 4. 54 up to 8. 53 dB). The best performance has been observed at the engine speed of 1550 min– 1, with attenuations, respectively of 2. 46 dB(A) and 7. 67 dB. Outside of the engine speed interval 1400 - 1700 min– 1, the attenuations always resulted lower than 1 dB(A) for the weighed A sound pressure level and between 0. 66 and 7. 72 dB...|$|E
