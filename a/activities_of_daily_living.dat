5|$|The {{presence}} of pain depends {{mainly on the}} location of the cancer and the stage of the disease.

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E

Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with {{an increased risk of}} early death.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} depression and <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> <b>of</b> patients with rheumatoid arthri-tis by their gender. Methods: The subjects for this study were 184 patients registered in S University Hospital. and the period of data collection was from May 1, 2012 to August 20, 2012. The data were analyzed with t-test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and Pearson's correlation. Results: For depression, there were significant differences by mar-riage and religion in male patients and by education in female patients. For <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living,</b> there were significant differ-ences by marriage, age and education in female patients. Depression was negatively correlated with <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Conclusion: Managing depression and <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> were important for both male and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} cross-regional {{validity of}} the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) with a specific focus on valid use with Middle Europeans. Design: Descriptive cross-regional validation study. Participants: A total of 1346 participants from Middle Europe and 144, 143 participants from North America, UK/Ireland, the Nordic Countries, other Europe, Australia/New Zealand and Asia, {{between the ages of}} 3 and 103 years, in good health and with a variety of diagnoses, were selected from the AMPS database. Methods: Many-facet Rasch analysis was used to analyse participant raw data, and effect sizes were used to evaluate for differential item functioning. Evaluation for differential test functioning was also implemented. Results: None <b>of</b> the 20 <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> process items, and only one <b>of</b> the <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> motor items demonstrated differential item functioning. The <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> motor item Aligns exceeded the significant effect size criterion of +/- 0. 55 logit, but the significant differential item functioning did not lead to differential test functioning (i. e. all measures fell within the 95 % confidence bands). Conclusion: This study provides further evidence of {{validity of the}} AMPS when used to evaluate quality <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> tasks performance across world regions. The AMPS measures can be used as objective indices <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> ability in rehabilitation settings and in international collaborative research related to <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> task performance...|$|R

5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to perform a systematic review on training outcomes influencing physical fitness, <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> performance, and quality-of-life in institutionalized older people. We reviewed 27 studies on older people (age, â‰¥ 70 yrs) in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. Our ultimate goal was to propose criteria for an evidence-based exercise protocol aimed at improving physical fitness, <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> performance, and quality-of-life of frail institutionalized older people. The interventions, described in the reviewed studies that showed strong or very strong effect sizes were used to form an exercise prescription. The conclusion is that there is firm evidence for training effects on physical fitness, functional performance, <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> performance, and quality-of-life. The training should contain a combination of progressive resistance training, balance training, and functional training. The proposed intensity is moderate to high, assessed on a 0 - 10 scale for muscle strengthening activities. The training frequency was three times a week, and the total duration was at least 10 wks.

40|$|Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis Disease is {{the most}} common {{neurological}} demyelinization disorder in young adults that leads to their disability. Because of the side effects of treatment drugs, it seems that another method should be used. Correct nutrition is one of these methods. The aim of this research was to determine the effects <b>of</b> nutrition on <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> in MS patients referring to the Iranian MS society in 2010. Methods: In this quasi- experimental study (before and after investigation), 40 MS patients were selected on basis of purposive and accessible sampling method. The data was collected via questionnaires. The intervention comprised of correct nutrition algorithm education for 12 weeks. All questionnaires were filled before and after the intervention by subjects and then pre/post intervention data was analyzed with SPSS 16 software. Statistical tests included Student paired and T tests. Results: The statistical analysis showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between mean score <b>of</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> <b>of</b> MS patients before and after intervention(P< 0. 001), thus confirming the hypothesis of the study.
