5|$|The family Bovidae {{is placed}} in the order <b>Artiodactyla</b> (which {{includes}} the even-toed ungulates). It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the ungulates, and 300 known extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans and {{artiodactyls}} now {{are classified}} under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still {{referred to as}} <b>Artiodactyla,</b> which includes both whales and hippopotamuses. The hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are members}} of the infraorder Cetacea, which are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the order <b>Artiodactyla</b> (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{common eland}} was first {{described}} in 1766 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas. It {{belongs to the}} order <b>Artiodactyla,</b> family Bovidae and subfamily Bovinae. Common elands are sometimes {{considered part of the}} genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but are usually categorized as Taurotragus, along with the giant eland (T. derbianus).|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (<b>Artiodactyla).</b> Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order <b>Artiodactyla,</b> which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order <b>Artiodactyla,</b> the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor of deer.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order <b>Artiodactyla.</b> Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as <b>Artiodactyla</b> (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
25|$|Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) {{are closer}} to Carnivora and bats than to <b>Artiodactyla</b> (even-toed ungulates).|$|E
25|$|Rila Monastery Nature Park is {{inhabited}} by 202 vertebrate species. There are 52 species of mammals. The number of bats species is 15, or 50% {{of the diversity}} in Bulgaria and 45% in Europe. There are 20 species of small mammals: 9 Insectivora, 1 Lagomorpha and 13 Rodentia. Of them the European snow vole is a relict. The large mammals include 13 Carnivora and 4 <b>Artiodactyla</b> species. The most typical mammals in the park are the grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, brown bear, European badger, European polecat, European otter, European pine marten, beech marten, wildcat, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} living mammals, the more {{striking}} of Owen's contributions {{relate to the}} monotremes, marsupials and the anthropoid apes. He {{was also the first}} to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed (Perissodactyla) and the even-toed (<b>Artiodactyla),</b> while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by Charles Darwin, in South America. Toxodon, from the pampas, was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata and herbivorous Cetacea. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant armadillo, which he named Glyptodon (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant ground-sloths, Mylodon (1842) and Megatherium (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the false killer whale in 1863.|$|E
500|$|The {{cetaceans}} became aquatic around 50 {{million years}} ago (mya). Based on molecular and morphological research, the cetaceans genetically and morphologically fall firmly within the <b>Artiodactyla</b> (even-toed ungulates). The term [...] "Cetartiodactyla" [...] reflects the idea that whales evolved within the ungulates. The term was coined by merging the name for the two orders, Cetacea and <b>Artiodactyla,</b> into a single word. Under this definition, the closest living land relative of the whales and dolphins {{is thought to be}} the hippopotamuses.|$|E
500|$|The elk {{is a large}} animal of the {{ungulate}} order <b>Artiodactyla,</b> possessing an {{even number}} of toes on each foot, {{similar to those of}} camels, goats and cattle. It is a ruminant species, with a four-chambered stomach, and feeds on grasses, plants, leaves and bark. During the summer, elk eat almost constantly, consuming between [...] of vegetation daily. In North America, males are called bulls, and females are called cows. In Asia, stag and hind, respectively, are sometimes used instead.|$|E
500|$|The sheep (Ovis aries) is a quadrupedal, {{ruminant}} mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep {{are members}} of the order <b>Artiodactyla,</b> the even-toed ungulates. Although the name [...] "sheep" [...] applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe (...) , an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a [...] lamb.|$|E
500|$|Cetaceans are {{characterized}} by a [...] body, paddle-shaped front limbs and vestigial hind limbs. Their tails have been flattened into flukes to aid propulsion. They have lungs, and must surface regularly to breathe air through blowholes (modified nostrils) situated {{on the top of}} the cranium. The cetaceans are included in the order Cetartiodactyla with the <b>Artiodactyla</b> (the even-toed ungulates). Previously, they were placed within their own order, Cetacea, now an infraorder. They are divided into two subgroups, the Odontoceti (the toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises) and the Mysticeti (the baleen whales), formerly suborders but now considered parvorders or unranked taxa. There are 89 living species of cetaceans (including the functionally extinct Chinese river dolphin). [...] In addition, numerous species of extinct cetaceans have been documented, but they are not listed here. This list contains only the known, extant cetacean species including several recently defined species.|$|E

2500|$|While road access {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} land clearing for farming, it also has other indirect yet significant implications for hunting and the bushmeat trade. [...] Bushmeat refers to wildlife that live in the forest. [...] In Africa, the forest are often referred to as “the bush”, thus creating the term bushmeat. [...] Bushmeat may include any sort of animal that lives in the forest that is hunted for its meat. [...] In the DRC, the majority of bushmeat consists of <b>artiodactyla</b> species and make up almost 90% of all bushmeat trade. [...] After <b>artiodactyla</b> species, primates consist of the next largest group at about 5% of all traded bushmeat.|$|E
2500|$|Lamoids, or llamas (as {{they are}} more {{generally}} known as a group), consist of the vicuña (Vicugna vicugna, prev. Lama vicugna), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), Suri alpaca, and Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos, prev. Lama guanicoe pacos), and the domestic llama (Lama glama). Guanacos and vicuñas live in the wild, while alpacas – as well as llamas – exist only as domesticated animals. Although early writers compared llamas to sheep, their similarity to the camel was soon recognized. They {{were included in the}} genus Camelus along with alpaca in the Systema Naturae (1758) of Carl Linnaeus. They were, however, separated by Georges Cuvier in 1800 under the name of lama along with the guanaco. Alpacas and vicuñas are in genus Vicugna. The genera Lama and Vicugna are, with the two species of true camels, the sole existing representatives of a very distinct section of the <b>Artiodactyla</b> or even-toed ungulates, called Tylopoda, or [...] "bump-footed", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet. The Tylopoda consist of a single family, the Camelidae, and shares the [...] order <b>Artiodactyla</b> with the Suina (pigs), the Tragulina (chevrotains), the Pecora (ruminants), and the Whippomorpha (hippos and cetaceans, which belong to <b>Artiodactyla</b> from a cladistic, if not traditional, standpoint). The Tylopoda have more or less affinity to each of the sister taxa, standing in some respects in a middle position between them, sharing some characteristics from each, but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increase}} in mammalian abundance is intriguing. There {{is no evidence}} of any increased extinction rate among the terrestrial biota. Increased [...] levels may have promoted dwarfing – which may have encouraged speciation. Many major mammalian orders – including the <b>Artiodactyla,</b> horses, and primates – appeared and spread around the globe 13,000 to 22,000 years after the initiation of the PETM.|$|E
2500|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Mendoza and Palmqvist {{compared}} the habitats and diets of 134 species of living ungulates, for which this data is known, both <b>Artiodactyla</b> and Perissodactyla, against [...] "32 craniodental measurements" [...] {{to discover what}} correlations exist for the group studied and to test hypotheses concerning hypsodonty and mode of life. Habitats considered were open (savanna, deserts), mixed (wooded savanna, brush) and closed (riverine and forest). Diets considered were grazing, mixed grazing and browsing, browsing, omnivory and special niches, such as treetop browsing. Measurements included the Hypsodonty Index (HI) and Muzzle Width (MZW). The results showed that, except for the [...] "high-level" [...] browsers, hypsodonty is correlated to [...] "open and mixed habitats". The HI was not precise enough to discriminate between open and mixed. However, high MZW is correlated to grazing in the open category, although some forest species also have wide muzzles. Grazers therefore are distinguished {{by a combination of}} high-crowned cheek teeth and wide muzzles, both of which are possessed by Elasmotherium. Life in the open is implied.|$|E
60|$|Consider {{how long}} a time has elapsed since the Miocene epoch. Yet, at that time {{there is reason to}} believe that every {{important}} group in every order of the Mammalia was represented. Even the comparatively scanty Eocene fauna yields examples of the orders Cheiroptera, Insectivora, Rodentia, and Perissodactyla; of <b>Artiodactyla</b> under both the Ruminant and the Porcine modifications; of Caranivora, Cetacea, and Marsupialia.|$|E
5000|$|This {{makes the}} <b>Artiodactyla</b> as {{traditionally}} defined an invalid paraphyletic taxon, since it includes animals descended {{from a common}} ancestor, but does not include all its descendants. Phylogenetic classification only recognizes monophyletic taxa; that is, groups that descend from a common ancestor and include all its descendants. To address this problem, the traditional order <b>Artiodactyla</b> and infraorder Cetacea are sometimes subsumed into the more inclusive Cetartiodactyla taxon. An alternative approach is to include both land-land dwelling even toed ungulates and ocean-dwelling cetaceans in a revised <b>Artiodactyla</b> taxon.|$|E

5000|$|The even-toed {{ungulates}} (<b>Artiodactyla,</b> [...] ) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes.
