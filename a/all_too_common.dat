Problems such as academic stress, future job uncertainty, and interpersonal relationships {{are just some of}} the interrelated complications easily found in universities. To address this issue, the current mixed-method study uses a series of focus group sessions in order to solicit the various issues surrounding students’ day to day in-campus life challenges and their corresponding coping strategies. A survey questionnaire was then formulated from the results of the focus group sessions. A total of 123 valid surveys were collected. Data collected were analyzed together with their corresponding demographical backgrounds such as: gender, year level of study, place of living, working or non-working students, and course of study. Results show that the common students’ related complications are health problems, future career issues, lessons and examinations, learning difficulties, self-efficacy issues, interpersonal difficulties, time management, and stress causing issues. Statistical analyses were accomplished resulting to significant students’ school problems determining background factors such as students’ course of study, gender, working or non-working students, and place of living. While no significant differences were found on the common students’ coping strategies. Lastly, there seems to be a high correlation between the students’ problems and coping strategies within the stress causing issues, suggesting that stress related issues to be the root cause of major complications for university students in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Most of {{the current}} {{disaster}} awareness education {{takes place in the}} form of brochures, posters, and videos. They are <b>all</b> right, but <b>too</b> <b>common</b> to raise any special interest of the general public. However, disasters are on the rise, especially the fire related hazards. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} develop new media products to attract people’s attention so that effective practice promoting disaster preparedness can be achieved. In this study, the authors targeted the household fire hazards for public education and used the immersive Google Cardboard as the means of delivering the educational message. First, SketchUp was used to create a 3 -dimensional residential model. Then, the model was imported into the Unity 3 D environment to add the effects of flames and smokes. Finally, Google’s open Software Development Kit (SDK) was used to provide a virtual reality simulation of the scene. Using gyroscope, head movement tracking, and side-by-side stereo images, the wearer of the Google Cardboard could walk through the fire scene virtually in the first person view. The results showed that the simulation was convincing and provided more realistic experience to the users than the traditional brochures, posters, and videos. This method could also be modified for use in other types of hazards...|$|R

500|$|On-court fights {{had been}} <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>common</b> in the 1970s, often {{including}} bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington's punch {{resulted in the}} league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that [...] "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other." [...] Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and could have called a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.|$|E

500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other {{television}} series that have depicted rape (Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black, and Outlander), Opam felt that [...] "since rape is one of the show’s core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>common.</b> It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E

40|$|Morbidity and {{mortality}} due to infectious disease is {{greater in the}} elderly than in the young, at least partly because of age-associated decreased immune competence, which renders individuals more susceptible to pathogens. This susceptibility is particularly evident for novel infectious agents such as in {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} but is also <b>all</b> <b>too</b> apparent for <b>common</b> pathogens such as influenza. Many years ago, it was noted that the elderly possessed oligoclonal expansions of T cells, especially of CD 8 (+) cells. At the same time, it was established that cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity was associated with many of the same phenotypic and functional alterations to T-cell immunity that were being reported as biomarkers associated with aging. It was discovered that CMV was the prime driving force behind most of the oligoclonal expansions and altered phenotypes and functions of CD 8 cells. Independently, longitudinal studies of a free-living population of the very old in Sweden over the past decade have led to the emerging concept of an 'immune risk phenotype' (IRP), predicting mortality, which was itself found to be associated with CMV seropositivity. These findings support our hypothesis that the manner in which CMV and the host immune system interact is critical in determining the IRP and hence is predictive of mortality. In this sense, then, we suggest that immunosenescence is contagiou...|$|R

40|$|Culture {{has been}} an <b>all</b> <b>too</b> a <b>common</b> subject in today's, private and public, discourse. This {{is due to the}} {{challenges}} brought about by the changes occurring to the world as we know it. Issues like globalization and world migration have brought about the amalgamation of people from all quarters of life. The host countries have had regular discourses {{on how to deal with}} the influx of immigrants that they face and subjects like integration and assimilation have been the talk of day. But this is just one side of the coin. The immigrants have their own issues to face. They are subjected to adhere to the natives and integrate, if not assimilate, to the host country. They are expected to be more like their hosts in order to avoid any conflicts. This discourse was the motivation of this thesis. The thesis probed, through the eye of the immigrant (that is Kenyans), what are the cultural challenges that immigrants face and how do these challenges reshape their identities. In order for this research to be a success, certain strategies had to be taken. Interviews were undertaken on a face to face basis and observation was done in order to collect the non-verbal data, which is as important, in order to understand the anatomic factors of culture. The research did indeed find out that culture is not static and that it is rather relative to its environs. This brought about the issue of identity change and what are its effects and affects. This thesis is comprised of five chapters. The first chapter will be the introductory part to the study. Chapter two will discuss on the relevant literature, on the topic of culture and identity, used in developing relevant arguments. Chapter three will focus on the methodology used to carry out the research. Chapter four discusses the research findings, and chapter five will entail detailed discourse on the study...|$|R
