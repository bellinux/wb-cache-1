5|$|The Army {{wanted the}} vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, autocannon, coaxial weapon, and an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> system. The weapons suite had to be {{manually}} operable when damaged and the commander's weapon station had to incorporate a shield. Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor weapon would be carried on board. The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} that day, Egyptian Chief-of-Staff Saad el-Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia, at President Sadat's request. Shazly sought {{to assess the}} situation {{and to work with}} Khalil on a plan to counter the Israeli advance. They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the east bank and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force, and to have Egyptian forces on the east bank attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli corridor to the canal. Azmy's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal, and additional Sa'iqa units would be committed. Shazly also solved a major problem concerning anti-tank weaponry. Azmy's brigade was almost completely lacking anti-tank weapons; it had been stripped of its <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> (ATGM) battalion, equipped with AT-3 Saggers and RPG-7s, which was sent to the east bank to support the initial offensive. This battalion, and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade, were now withdrawn from the east bank throughout October 18 and brought back to their units. Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy, as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail, not to withdraw any units from the east bank. Several measures decided upon were not implemented however.|$|E

25|$|Designed by Alvis in the 1960s, the CVR(T) family {{includes}} Scorpion and Scimitar light reconnaissance tanks, Spartan armoured {{personnel carriers}} (APC)s, Sultan {{command and control}} vehicle, Samaritan armoured ambulance, Striker <b>anti–tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> vehicle and Samson armoured recovery vehicle. All members of the CVR(T) family were designed to share common automotive components and suspension; aluminium armour was selected to keep the weight down. By 1996, more than 3,500 had been built for British Army use and export.|$|E
25|$|The 100mm {{tank gun}} is also capable of firing the 9M117M1 Arkan <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> (ATGM) {{which is a}} further {{development}} of the 9M117 Bastion (NATO reporting name: AT-10 Stabber). With a weight of 21.5kg, this ATGM has a penetration value of 750–800mm of RHA behind explosive reactive armor (ERA). The turret holds four 9M117M1 missiles and is launched through the 100mm gun ensuring a crucial advantage due to the loading being completely internal rather than external unlike other infantry fighting vehicles. While traveling at an average speed of 300m/s, the Arkan is guided via laser beam riding and is capable of destroying targets up to 5.5km away. This method of guidance allows it to be stealthy and insusceptible to countermeasures.|$|E

500|$|Croatian {{forces in}} and around Varaždin and nearby Čakovec {{consisted}} of 640 ZNG troops (including 60 who had been deployed from Zagreb), 100 police, 300 People's Protection (Narodna zaštita) troops and several hundred armed civilians. The ZNG troops were subordinated to the 104th Brigade and to the 5th Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade – but were lightly armed. Besides small arms, they had only 17 mortars, two 9M14 Malyutka <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> systems, two [...] anti-aircraft machine guns and four armoured personnel carriers. Initially, command of Croatian forces in the city was not unified and Colonel Želimir Škarec of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia only had a coordination role.|$|E
500|$|The AMX-30 has {{a number}} of {{different}} variations, including a number of other armoured vehicles based on the same chassis. A simplified version of the tank, without the infra-red searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander's cupola was developed for export, known as the [...] "basic AMX-30". This version also came devoid of the pressurized air filtering system, and moved the smaller [...] machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger [...] M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a [...] tank gun able to fire the supersonic [...] (Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé) <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile,</b> as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament. However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972. The vehicles based on the chassis include an armoured recovery vehicle, a bridgelayer, a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, a tactical nuclear missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.|$|E
500|$|Preparations {{to seize}} the JNA {{facilities}} in Bjelovar took place on 21–29 September. These involved the placing of obstacles around the JNA facilities, setting up of artillery and air defence units, and drafting of plans to capture the JNA garrison, codenamed Operation Bilogora. The 1st Battalion of the 105th Brigade was deployed to around the villages of Bedenik and Velika Pisanica, the 2nd Battalion {{in the village of}} Narta, and the 3rd Battalion north of Bjelovar, thereby encircling the city. In the city itself, nine battlegroups were deployed to attack armoured units which might attempt a breakout. Air defence systems consisting of two [...] machine guns and two [...] anti-aircraft guns were set up in nearby villages. A battery of towed [...] T-12 antitank guns was deployed to the Hrgovljani area. In an attempt to mitigate an overall shortage of anti-tank weapons, 200 Molotov cocktails were sent from Zagreb and three armoured personnel carriers armed with 9M14 Malyutka <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> systems arrived from Virovitica on 23 September. The crisis headquarters was to coordinate all activities of the Croatian armed forces based in Bjelovar, as well as reinforcements received from Varaždin after the JNA garrison based there surrendered, but Colonel Želimir Škarec, a member of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia, was appointed as the commanding officer of the military operation.|$|E

2500|$|The FV102 Striker was the <b>Anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> {{version of}} the CVR(T). The British Army ordered 48 of the version, which were armed with the Swingfire missile system. Striker had five {{missiles}} ready to fire in a mounting {{at the rear of}} the vehicle, with another five stowed inside. Secondary armament consisted of a commander's 7.62mm GPMG and multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers. Striker looked very similar to Spartan in appearance, becoming more easily identifiable [...] only when the missile tubes were raised. Striker is no longer in service since the Swingfire missile was replaced by the Javelin in mid–2005.|$|E
