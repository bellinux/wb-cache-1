40|$|<b>Agalmatolite</b> is a {{peculiar}} rock {{known by its}} high concentration of pyrophyllite and used worldwide in the ceramic industry. In Brazil, agalmatolites resources are hosted by meta-volcanic-sedimentary rocks of the Rio das Velhas greenstone belt that occur NW of Belo Horizonte (MG). The deposits are placed along a SE-NW, strike-slip fault, which cross-cuts the Archaean stratigraphy and is associated with metamorphic-metassomatic-hydrothermal events. Considering the complexities involved in characterizing such materials by conventional methods, and using this type area of occurrence of agalmatolites as a control, this works aims to: (i) evaluate the potential of reflectance spectroscopy (RS) as a expedite, portable method to characterize agalmatolites; (ii) to seek a relationship between spectral characteristics of these minerals and their use in the ceramic industry, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of ASTER data and image products to map agalmatolite-related minerals remotely. RS allowed the distinction of several minerals, including pyrophyllite, kyanite, diaspore, micas, dumortierite and tourmaline, grouped into three zones. These zones typified in the <b>agalmatolite</b> deposits have a specific application in the ceramic industry, indicating the suitability of RS to characterize such industrial materials and help defining their use. Information extracted from ASTER data, comprising visible-infrared wavelengths, allowed the mapping of podiform structures along the shear zone containing similar mineral zoning. These results {{have important implications for}} regional exploration of these <b>agalmatolite</b> bodies and to detailed mapping of mine faces and boreholes, with vast potential benefits for the ceramic industry.

Devido aos avanços no processamento de cargas minerais, as indústrias estão exigindo cada vez mais produtos interativos com os componentes de formulação. Para tal, torna-se extremamente importante compreender a função das matériasprimas em cada uso {{industrial}} específico, gerando, desta forma, produtos sob medida para cada aplicação segundo as necessidades específicas de cada mercado, evitando-se, assim, desperdícios. Dentre os principais setores de compra e consumo de cargas minerais tem-se a indústria de tintas. Sendo um meio bastante competitivo, os fabricantes deste setor estão sempre procurando melhorar seus produtos, resultando na obtenção de uma maior fatia do mercado. Nesse sentido, o presente trabalho, tem como principal objetivo apresentar um estudo baseado na aplicação de cargas minerais na indústria de tintas, buscando contribuir para o entendimento da importância e, do efeito das propriedades físicas, químicas e mineralógicas de diferentes cargas, na formulação de uma tinta, sendo o poder de cobertura do substrato o parâmetro avaliado. Estas tintas são preparadas com uma emulsão de copolímero acrílico e aplicadas para pinturas internas em paredes. O procedimento de otimização foi realizado tendo como base um desenho experimental por um método de mistura nomeado de Simplex segundo Monte-Carlo. Amostras de tinta foram preparadas por reposição de massa da carga original com a mesma massa de três diferentes minerais. Cada uma variou de 0 % a 100 %. Dois de nove minerais testados são normalmente usados em formulações de tintas no Brasil. Elas são Carbonato de Cálcio Precipitado (PCC) e Carbonato de Cálcio Natural (GCC). A terceira carga foi selecionada entre Caulins (C, SB, PA) Dolomitas (DR,DM), Agalmatolito (A) e Filito (F). Os resultados obtidos mostraram que os três tipos de caulins testados se mostraram mais eficiêntes em relação ao poder de cobertura do que as dolomitas. The fillers are minerals compounds chemically stable, {{they can}} be extracted from ore deposits, or obtained by industrial process. Due to advances on mineral fillers processing, the industry is increasingly requesting interactive products with the formulation components. For that, it is extremely {{important to understand the}} functions of the raw materials in each industrial specific use, generating, in this way, products made for each application, second to the specific needs of each market, avoiding material waste. Among the principals buying and consume sectors there is the paint industry. Being a very competitive industry, the manufacturers of this sector are always trying to upgrade his products, resulting in a large market piece obtaining. In this way, the present work main objective is to present a study based on the applications of mineral fillers in the paint industry, looking for contribute for the understanding of the importance and the effect of the physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of different fillers, in formulation of a paint, as the measured parameter was the substrate hiding power. These paints are prepared with acrylic copolymer emulsion and targeted for interior wall paint. The optimization procedure was carried out on the basis of experimental design by a mixture method named Simplex couplet with Monte-Carlo. Paint samples were prepared by replacing the mass of the original filler with the same mass of three different minerals. Each one was varied from 0 % to 100 %. Two of nine minerals tested were those normally used in the formulation of paints in Brazil. They were Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC), and, Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC). The third filler chosen was between kaolin, Dolomite (DR,DM), <b>Agalmatolite</b> (A) e Filite (F). The obtained results showed that the tree types of kaolin tested where more efficient than the dolomites in terms of the substrate hiding power...|$|E
