50|$|On Feb. 18, 1981 {{an audio}} change for long {{distance}} calls was implemented. The new automatic number identification eliminated the familiar “Your number please” with the automatic notation of the number. It affected all one and two-party customers in Burgessville only. Company general manager Ardyth Williams said {{the move to}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> was necessary {{to keep up with}} the areas around the North Norwich system. It also resulted in some pay back for the independent company because it received money from Bell Canada for each long distance call completed in this manner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — According to the {{features}} of RMB banknote images, combining digital image processing and pattern recognition, this paper proposes a recognition method of RMB word numbers based on character features. The recognition algorithms include: image preprocessing, number region location, feature extraction and character recognition. The experimental {{results show that the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> based on this method achieves high recognition rate and processing speed.

50|$|PTT ID, or Push-To-Talk ID, is {{a generic}} term for an <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI)-like <b>system</b> used in two-way radio <b>systems.</b> It {{provides}} <b>identification</b> of the transmitting radio over the air, and {{is commonly used}} in selective calling/signaling systems, usually in commercial and public safety radio systems.|$|R
50|$|The SMPA {{operates}} much equipment {{which is}} standardized {{throughout the entire}} Korean National Police force. The metropolitan areas in particular user <b>Automatic</b> Vehicle <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>systems,</b> however SMPA's computer dispatch systems, Automatic Vehicle Location Systems and Mobile Data Terminals are standard features across the country, as is policy of using specialist armed police rather than issuing firearms to each officer. SMPA also operates {{a significant percentage of}} the National Police Force's 4,891 police cars, 1,685 police pick- ups, 765 police trucks, 865 special-mission vehicles and 9,181 police motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI) is {{a feature}} of a {{telecommunications}} network for automatically determining the origination telephone number on toll calls for billing purposes. <b>Automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> was originally created by AT&T Corporation for internal long distance charging purposes, {{eliminating the need for}} telephone operators to manually request the number of the calling party for a toll call.|$|R

5000|$|Caller ID {{provides}} some protection against unwanted calls, but {{can still be}} {{turned off by the}} calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification,</b> so the perpetrator's phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, this does not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones, in some cases, <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> itself can be spoofed or blocked, and mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use [...] "throwaway" [...] phones or SIMs.|$|R
50|$|Wink {{start is}} used to notify the remote side or PBX that it can send the Dialed <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> Service (DNIS), also {{referred}} to as the Called <b>Number.</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> (ANI) can also be transmitted.|$|R
50|$|Toll free numbers usually {{capture the}} {{telephone}} {{number of the}} caller for billing purposes through <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification,</b> which is independent of caller ID data and functions even if caller ID is blocked.|$|R
5000|$|... {{computerized}} mapping, automatic vehicle location, <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> and caller-identification {{technology are}} often used to enhance the service by pinpointing the locations of both the client and the most suitable vehicle for serving the client.|$|R
50|$|In today's 9-1-1 environment, {{the public}} can {{primarily}} make only emergency voice calls and Teletype calls (by deaf or hearing impaired persons). Only minimal data is delivered with these calls, such as <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification,</b> subscriber name and Automatic Location Identification, when available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI) on the NPA's {{switching}} systems began transmission on October 11, 1992 for some central office codes. The new numbering plan area (NPA) entered service on October 11, 1993. Permissive dialing of 416 continued across the Golden Horseshoe until January 1, 1994.|$|R
50|$|Lucky225, a.k.a. Jered Morgan, is a Southern California phone phreak {{and white}} hat {{security}} professional.

50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> or ANI, is {{a scheme}} that uses selcall for {{identification}} purposes. Typically a mobile radio will be configured to transmit a preconfigured selcall sequence when the user presses the ‘push-to-talk’ (PTT) button, which will automatically identify {{them to other}} devices listening on the same frequency on the radio network.|$|R
5000|$|Caller ID {{provides}} some protection against unwanted calls, but {{can still be}} {{turned off by the}} calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification,</b> so the perpetrator's phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, these do not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones and, in some cases, caller ID (but not necessarily <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> itself) can be spoofed or blocked. Mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use [...] "throwaway" [...] mobile phones or SIMs. Voice over IP users may send bogus caller ID or route calls through servers in multiple countries.Even in these cases, with sufficient law enforcement and telco effort, persistent abusers can often be tracked down by technical means.Call screening is another countermeasure against unsolicited calls.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>number</b> {{announcement}} {{systems are}} based on <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification,</b> and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with unlisted numbers, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no outgoing calls allowed. Installers of multi-line business services where outgoing calls from all lines display the company's main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as [...] "line one".|$|R
5000|$|Anonymous call {{rejection}} (ACR) is a landline calling feature that screens out calls from callers who have blocked their caller ID information. Anonymous {{call rejection}} {{is based on}} caller ID (not <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> or ANI). It is often free and included with caller ID on landlines, {{but it may be}} available separately from the local telephone company. ACR is not available in all areas.|$|R
50|$|Systems which {{identify}} the caller's {{name and address}} to emergency telephone numbers (such as Enhanced 9-1-1 in North America) {{may be unable to}} identify which of multiple parties on a shared line placed a distress call; this is aggravated by the use of old mechanical switching equipment for party lines as this obsolete apparatus consistently provides no caller ID and often also lacks <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> capability.|$|R
5000|$|If the PSAP {{receives}} {{calls from}} the telephone company on older analog trunks, they are usually Pulse driven circuits. These circuits are similar to traditional telephone lines, but are formatted to pass the calling party's <b>number</b> (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Identification,</b> ANI). (For historical reasons, the PSAP will refer to these as CAMA circuits even though Centralized Automatic Message Accounting (CAMA) is actually {{a reference to the}} call log.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Bell System {{dial service}} {{implemented}} a feature called <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI) which facilitated services like automated billing, toll-free 800-numbers, and 9-1-1 service. In manual service, the operator knows where a call is originating {{by the light}} on the switchboard jack field. Before ANI, long distance calls were placed into an operator queue and the operator asked the calling party's number and recorded it on a paper toll ticket.|$|R
50|$|Machine {{to machine}} devices that {{combined}} telephony and computing were first conceptualized by Theodore Paraskevakos {{while working on}} his Caller ID system in 1968, later patented in the U.S. in 1973. This system, similar but distinct from the panel call indicator of the 1920s and <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> of the 1940s, which communicated telephone numbers to machines, was the predecessor {{to what is now}} caller ID, which communicates numbers to people.|$|R

5000|$|In some countries, {{the terms}} caller display, calling line {{identification}} presentation (CLIP), call capture, or just calling line identity are used; call display is the predominant marketing name used in Canada (although some customers still {{refer to it}} colloquially as [...] "caller ID"). The idea of CNID as a service for POTS subscribers originated from <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI) {{as a part of}} toll free number service in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Crossbar offices {{used more}} shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit {{receiver}} (part of an element called an Originating Register) would {{be connected to}} a call {{just long enough to}} collect the subscriber's dialed digits. Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later crossbar systems had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> had been retrofitted to nearly all step-by-step and crossbar switches in the Bell System.|$|R
50|$|Some {{companies}} use <b>Automatic</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> (ANI) {{technology in}} order to capture the exact address of a landline phone call and the patient’s telephone number. This is the same technology that the E-911 people use because it cannot be blocked and it is delivered electronically to the system with the phone call. This allows it to be 100% reliable. The system also time-stamps every call with the exact time the call was made.|$|R
5000|$|ACDs route {{incoming}} {{calls to the}} most qualified employee or employees within a company that can address a caller's needs. The technology can also use rule-based instructions such as caller ID, <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification,</b> interactive voice response or dialed <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> services to determine how calls are handled. ACD systems are often found in offices that handle large volumes of incoming phone calls from callers who have no {{need to talk to}} a specific person, but require assistance from any of multiple persons (e.g., customer service representatives) at the earliest opportunity.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the urban}} and {{commercial}} areas where Panel was first used had message rate service rather than flat rate calling. For this reason the line finder had, besides the tip and ring leads for talking and the sleeve lead for control, a fourth wire for the District circuit to send metering pulses to control the message register. The introduction of direct distance dialing (DDD) in the 1950s required the addition of <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> equipment for centralized automatic message accounting.|$|R
5000|$|In {{land-line}} telephony, AIOD leads are Terminal equipment leads used {{solely to}} transmit automatic identified outward dialing (AIOD) {{data from a}} PBX to the {{public switched telephone network}} or to switched service networks (e.g., EPSCS), so that a vendor can provide a detailed monthly bill identifying long distance calling usage by individual PBX stations, tie trunks, or the attendant console. [...] It resembles common channel signalling in that the AIOD leads provide data for all trunks, but is used only for billing, thus resembling <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} Caller-ID, a form {{of calling}} <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (CNI), {{which is similar to}} <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI), in light of its privacy and social equity impact, and presents research findings that tend to support the precedence of callees' rights to know who is using their time and equipment over callers' rights to anonymity. The author examines the argument that Caller-ID will take away privacy rights and disproportionately help the wealthy, big businesses and the 'information rich' and concludes that Caller-ID accomplishes the opposite because it will have the greatest value {{to some of the most}} vulnerable members of society. He recommends certain safeguards in implementation and a method to resolve the issue of blocking. ...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, for voice T1s {{there are}} two main types: {{so-called}} [...] "plain" [...] or Inband T1s and PRI (Primary Rate Interface). While both carry voice telephone calls in similar fashion, PRIs are commonly used in call centers and provide not only the 23 actual usable telephone lines (Known as [...] "B" [...] channels for bearer) but also a 24th line (Known as the [...] "D" [...] channel for data) that carries line signaling information. This special [...] "D" [...] channel carries: Caller ID (CID) and <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI) data, required channel type (usually a B, or Bearer channel), call handle, Dialed <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> Service (DNIS) info, requested channel number and a request for response.|$|R
50|$|The {{reach of}} DDD was limited {{due to the}} {{inefficiency}} and expense of switching equipment, and the limited ability to process records of completed calls. One obstacle was {{that the majority of}} switching gear did not provide <b>Automatic</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> (ANI). Common control switches such as 1XB switch were fairly quickly retrofitted to provide ANI, and most 5XB switches were initially installed with ANI services. Panel switch were eventually retrofitted, as were some step-by-step that were not scheduled for immediate replacement. Even if a switch had ANI, it could not identify callers on party lines. This was only partly overcome by Tip Party Identification. As the cost of subscriber line carrier declined, party lines were gradually phased out.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} {{the task of}} <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> in natural context. We present and {{validate}} a language-independent semiautomatic approach to quickly building a gold standard for evaluating <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> by exploiting hand-aligned parallel data. We also present and extensively evaluate a robust rule-based <b>system</b> for <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> in natural context for Arabic {{for a variety of}} number formats and types. The system is shown to have strong performance, achieving, on a blind test, a 94. 8 % F-score for the task of correctly identifying number expression spans in natural text, and a 92. 1 % F-score for the task of correctly determining the core numerical value. 1...|$|R
50|$|In {{centralized}} AMA (CAMA), the originating Class 5 telephone switches used <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification</b> (ANI) and multi-frequency (MF) signaling to {{send the}} originating and dialed telephone numbers to the Class 4 toll connecting office. The Class 4 office recorded this information with punched tape machines on long strips of paper, that had approximately {{the width of a}} hand. Each day a technician cut the paper tapes and sent them to the accounting center to be read and processed to generate customer telephone bills. Each punch recorder was responsible for 100 trunks, and its associated call identity indexer (CII) identified the trunk for an initial entry when connecting the call, an answer entry when the called party answered, and a disconnect entry when the call was cleared.|$|R
50|$|Whitehorse {{converted}} from partial dial to full dial service on October 31, 1960. After this date, local communities' ring-down phones were replaced with local exchange service, using surplus central office switches {{that could be}} acquired at a relatively low cost. The wire line facilities along the highway was changed from ring-down services to multi-party lines off dial exchanges as the communities along the line received central office switches, {{most of which were}} Ericsson Rurax switches that during the late 1970s were modified to enable direct dialing of long distance calls, though without <b>automatic</b> <b>number</b> <b>identification.</b> The more remote multi-party lines were switched from wire to Exicom radios, while the Ruraxes were mostly replaced in the mid-1980s with modern solid-state digital switches, though the last Rurax remained in service in Swift River until 1987.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system was}} {{primitive}} by modern standards. It initially provided no support for <b>Automatic</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Identification</b> and no itemised record of calls, instead requiring subscribers to obtain expensive fixed-rate lines which included some {{number of hours}} of inbound calling from a [...] "band" [...] of one or several U.S. states or Canadian provinces. Early InWATS 800 calling lacked the complex routing features offered with modern toll-free service. After competitive carriers were allowed to compete with AT&T in establishing toll-free service, the three digit exchange following the 800 prefix was linked to a specific destination carrier and area code; the number itself corresponded to specific telephone switching offices and trunk groups. All calls went to one central destination; there was no means to place a toll-free call to another country.|$|R
