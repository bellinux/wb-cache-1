5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E

5|$|The time is unclear. Allan Cunningham {{states it}} is half past eleven, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Hogarth uses the early hour to {{highlight}} the debauchery occurring opposite the church, yet the print shows the hands {{at a time that}} could equally be half past twelve, and the painting shows a thin golden hand pointing to ten past twelve.|$|E
5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Chesney's {{predecessor}} Alexander {{has been}} credited with commissioning the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of Tournai marble.

5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E

5|$|Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University, meanwhile, {{argues that}} the play is a veiled warning against {{considering}} PETA as a nationalistic. Considering Pane's position at the Cultural Bureau, Woodrich suggests that Pane would {{have been aware of}} the Japanese occupation government's ultimate goal for PETA: to help defend the Indonesian archipelago against the Allies if necessary, a message which had to be conveyed implicitly owing to Pane's own position and the Japanese occupation government's strict censorship. Woodrich points to Aminah's father, a former employee of the Dutch colonial government, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the character's protests about joining PETA, seemingly in order to promote the safety and comfort of home, are actually based on an understanding of the colonial mindset and the accompanying manipulation; in-text, these protests can only be conveyed in implicit terms owing to the father's fear of the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E

Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) becomes concerned <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Olivia talk to Walter to help reverse the memory loss. During the case, in talking with the latest victim's wife, Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter. After {{the conclusion of the}} case, she admits to Nina that she will let the memory alterations continue, even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood.|$|E

5|$|For {{their efforts}} {{the men are}} given a week's leave: the {{airfield}} where they are based comes under enemy artillery bombardment; Bell receives a letter from his wife informing him that she has {{fallen in love with}} someone else and wishes to divorce; Captain Staros is relieved of his command by Lieutenant Colonel Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG in Washington. He offers to arrange a Purple Heart for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Congressman Donald Blythe (Reed Birney), a {{committed}} progressive liberal {{who has long}} pushed for education reform, with whom the Walker administration wants {{to work on a}} bill. Frank dismisses his proposal as too ambitious and asks him to rewrite it. Frank secretly passes a copy of Blythe’s proposal to Zoe. He then meets with Senator Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> she ought to consider seeking the nomination for Secretary of State. He also privately confronts Congressman Russo about his arrest and checkered history of substance abuse and soliciting prostitutes, and demands Russo’s loyalty in exchange for making the incident disappear.|$|E

She plans to suggest an offer from a widow in Belgium. Rivka is distraught by the idea of Mordechai being taken out of the country <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Yochay marry Shira instead. He and Shira both initially oppose the prospect, though he eventually warms to it and she agrees to take it into consideration on learning that her previous engagement has been called off due to her father's delays.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several {{arguments}} and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as they have to get up early the next morning.|$|E

After an attack by Narayana's henchmen, who are murdered by Pandu, he reveals {{that he is a}} gangster <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> she might want to rethink her proposal. After Shruti distances herself from Pandu, Pasupathy frames her with a mock sexual assault by a few gangsters unbeknownst to her family and the other villagers. He intends this act to ruin her life and subsequently force her to be his mistress. Learning this, Pandu confronts Pasupathy and warns him that he will face dire consequences if he is found guilty of being involved.|$|E
