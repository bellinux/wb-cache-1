40|$|INTRODUCTION: Variations {{in human}} T cell {{lymphotropic}} virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) proviral load (PVL) in infected individuals {{over time are}} not well understood. Objective: To evaluate the evolution of proviral load in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> and HAM/TSP patients {{in order to help}} determine periodicity for measuring proviral load. METHODS: A group of 104 HTLV- 1 infected patients, followed at the HTLV reference center in Salvador, Brazil, were included in the study (70 asymptomatic and 34 HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients). HTLV- 1 PVL was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at baseline and again at another point, either 24 months. RESULTS: HAM/TSP patients had higher PVL (ranging from 11, 041 to 317, 009 copies/ 10 (6) PBMC) when compared to <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> (ranging from 0 to 68, 228 copies/ 10 (6) PBMC). No statistically significant differences were observed in the medians of PVL in HAM/TSP patients or <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> over time. However, in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> with a PVL below 50, 000 copies/ 10 (6) PBMC, a statistically significant two-fold increase was observed over time. CONCLUSION: HTLV- 1 -PVL remained stable in both <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> and HAM/TSP patients over time. Frequent monitoring of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> with low PVLs is recommended and further studies should be conducted to assess the course of PVL in these patients over extended periods of time...|$|R

This work reports that, 24  h after stimulating whole blood with soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA), plasma interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) become significantly elevated in samples from <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> (n= 47) compared with those from negative controls (n= 50), all of them recruited from a blood bank. When compared with the reference test SLA-lymphoproliferative assay, IL- 2 appears as a new, 100 % sensitive and specific marker for <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> with a positive cellular response (compared with 100 % and 84. 78 %, respectively, for IFN-γ). Further studies in other transmission areas and in other cohorts of exposed {{people need to be}} performed to confirm these results. Once validated, IFN-γ and IL- 2 levels in SLA-stimulated whole blood could be reliably used in the field to estimate the prevalence of those <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> with Leishmania-specific cellular immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Background Ebola {{virus is}} one of the most virulent pathogens, killing a very high {{proportion}} of patients within 5 – 7 days. Two outbreaks of fulminating haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Gabon in 1996, with a 70 % case-fatality rate. During both outbreaks we identified some individuals in direct contact with sick patients who never developed symptoms. We aimed to determine whether these individuals were indeed infected with Ebola virus, and how they maintained asymptomatic status. Methods Blood was collected from 24 close contacts of symptomatic patients. These <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> were sampled 2, 3, or 4 times during a 1 -month period after the first exposure to symptomatic patients. Serum samples were analysed for the presence of Ebola antigens, virus-specific IgM and IgG (by ELISA and western blot), and different cytokines and chemokines. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and reverse-transcriptase-PCR assays were done to amplify RNA of Ebola virus. PCR products were then sequenced. Findings 11 of 24 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola antigens, indicating viral infection. Western-blot analysis showed that IgG responses were directed to nucleoprotein and viral protein of 40 kDa. The glycoprotein and viral protein of 24 kDa genes showed no nucleotide differences between symptomatic and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals.</b> <b>Asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> had a strong inflammatory response characterised by high circulating concentrations of cytokines and chemokines. Interpretation This study showed that asymptomatic, replicative Ebola infection can and does occur in human beings. The lack of genetic differences between symptomatic and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> suggest that <b>asymptomatic</b> Ebola infection did not result from viral mutations. Elucidation of the factors related to the genesis of the strong inflammatory response occurring early during the infectious process in these <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> could increase our understanding of the disease...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study of 128 individuals infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) was conducted to determine the correlation of reverse transcriptase-inhibiting (RTI) antibody to clinical disease. Thirty-two individuals were studied in each of four clinical groups: <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals,</b> those with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related complex, and those with AIDS. Our study showed that 78 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals,</b> 53 % of those with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, 50 % of those with AIDS-related complex, and only 25 % of those with AIDS have RTI antibody. Concurrent measurement of measles antibody level {{was used as an}} indicator of the immune status of these individuals. Measles antibody did not decline in persons with clinical disease, but <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> had lower antibody titers, possibly due to hypergammaglobulinemia associated with advanced HIV infection. These results indicate that more HIV-infected <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> than symptomatic individuals have RTI antibody. This suggests either that the RTI antibody level decreases with the progression of disease in HIV infection or that symptomatic individuals do not produce RTI antibody. The presence or absence of RTI antibody can thus be used as a marker of advanced disease...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the abnormal findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects. Materials and Methods: The study included 48 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> and 27 patients who had already been suffering from low back pain. All participants underwent routine blood analyses and bilateral lumbosacral roentgenograms were taken. In all participants, lumbar MRI scans were performed through L 1 -S 1 intervertebral disc spaces. Results: The mean age of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> was 25. 5 ± 3. 5 years, while of the patient group it was 26 ± 2. 9 years. In <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals,</b> after lumbar MRI, disc degeneration in at least one intervertebral disc level, annular tear, endplate abnormality, disc bulging, and disc protrusion were detected in 33. 3 %, 16. 6 %, 4. 16 %, 6. 25 %, and 27 % of cases, respectively. When compared with the patient group, only the difference in the disc bulging ratio (25. 92 %) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: MRI may reveal high rates of abnormal signs in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individuals</b> who do not suffer from low back pain. The present authors believe that ordering this scan on patients who suffer from low back pain but not planned to undergo surgery will unnecessarily increase health care expenses.

40|$|A 35 year-old {{asymptomatic}} Caucasian female with {{a family}} history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was referred for cardiologic evaluation. The electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed for further assessment of myocardial function and presence of myocardial scar. CMR showed normal left ventricular systolic size, measurements and function. However, there was extensive, diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) throughout the left ventricle. This finding was consistent with extensive myocardial scarring and was highly suggestive of advanced, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Genotyping showed a heterozygous mis-sense mutation (275 G>A) in the cardiac troponin T (TNNT 2) gene, which is causally associated with HCM. There have been no previous reports of such extensive, atypical pattern of myocardial scarring despite an otherwise structurally and functionally normal left ventricle in an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>individual</b> with HCM.
