40|$|Thermodynamic {{analysis}} and numerical modeling of hurricane intensity {{has shown that}} its {{is controlled by the}} enthalpy transfer from the ocean surface and by drag. Direct measurements of drag, evaporation, and sensible heat transfer are not easily performed on the high seas. Therefore, a wind wave tank has been constructed in which a few aspects of a tropical storm are simulated. The air velocity inside the <b>annular</b> <b>tank</b> is comparable to that of hurricane. However, the three dimensionality of the tank obscures the quantitative comparison between experiments and actual conditions over the surface of the ocean at high wind speeds. The design of the wind wave tank and the initial experiments create a foundation for future and more comprehensive experimental programs. This thesis focuses mainly on the design and engineering of the tank, and on the fluid mechanics of the rotational flow in the tank.

Experiments looked at tanks of varying radii in a co-located set of nested tanks, a 1 by 2 array, and a 1 by 3 array.

These experiments were performed at two widely separated {{times in the}} 1980 s under two programs at the Rocky Flats Plant`s Critical Mass Laboratory. The uranyl nitrate solution contained about 370 g of uranium per liter, but this concentration varied a little over {{the duration of the}} studies. The uranium was enriched to about 93 % [sup 235]U. All tanks were typical of sizes commonly found in nuclear production plants. They were about 2 m tall and ranged in diameter from 0. 6 m to 1. 5 m. Annular thicknesses and conditions of neutron reflection, moderation, and absorption were such that criticality would be achieved with these dimensions. Only 13 of the entire set of 74 experiments proved to be subcritical when tanks were completely filled with solution. Single tanks of several radial thicknesses were studied as well as small line arrays (1 x 2 and 1 x 3) of <b>annular</b> <b>tanks.</b> Many systems were reflected on four sides and the bottom by concrete, but none were reflected from above. Many experiments also contained materials within and outside the annular regions that contained strong neutron absorbers.

40|$|AbstractThe Lorentz force {{generated}} by electromagnetic {{field on the}} surface of the cylinder in the electrolyte solution may modify the structures of the flow boundary layer effectively. The transient control process of Lorentz force is investigated experimentally for lift amplification and vibration suppression. The experiments are conducted in a rotating <b>annular</b> <b>tank</b> filled with a low-conducting electrolyte. A cylinder with an electro-magnetic actuator is placed into the electrolyte. The lift force of cylinder is measured using the strain gages attached to a fixed beam, and the flow fields are visualized by the dye markers. The results show that the upper vortex on the cylinder is suppressed, and the wake becomes a line and leans to the lower side under the action of upside Lorentz force while the lower vortex on the cylinder is suppressed and limited in a small region. Therefore, the value of lift increases with the variation of flow field. However, the vortexes on the cylinder are suppressed fully under the action of symmetrical Lorentz force which leads to the suppression of lift oscillation and then the vibration of cylinder are suppressed fully...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{collective}} behaviour of fish shoals in annular domains. Shoal mates are modelled as self-propelled particles moving on a discrete lattice. Collective decision-making {{is determined by}} information exchange among neighbours. Neighbourhoods are specified using the perceptual limit and numerosity of fish. Fish self-propulsion and obedience to group decisions are described through random variables. Spatio-temporal schooling patterns are measured using coarse observables adapted from the literature on coupled oscillator networks and features of the time-varying network describing the fish-to-fish information exchange. Experiments on zebrafish schooling in an <b>annular</b> <b>tank</b> are used to validate the model. Effects of group size and obedience parameter on coarse observables and network features are explored to understand the implications of perceptual numerosity and spatial density on fish schooling. The proposed model is also compared with a more traditional metric model, in which the numerosity constraint is released and fish interactions depend only on physical configurations. Comparison shows that the topological regime on which the proposed model is constructed allows for interpreting characteristic behaviours observed in the experimental study that are not captured by the metric model...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{particle}} tracking is used {{to study}} chaotic transport experimentally in laminar, chaotic, and turbulent flows in an <b>annular</b> <b>tank</b> that rotates sufficiently rapidly to insure two-dimensionality of the flow. For the laminar and chaotic velocity fields, the flow consists of a chain of vortices sandwiched between unbounded jets. In these flow regimes, tracer particles stick for long times to remnants of invariant surfaces around the vortices, then make long excursions ("flights") in the jet regions. The probability distributions for the flight time durations exhibit power-law rather than exponential decays, indicating that the particle trajectories are described mathematically as L 6 vy flights (i. e. the trajectories have infinite mean square displacement per flight). Sticking time probability distributions are also characterized by power laws, as found in previous numerical studies. The mixing of an ensemble of tracer particles is superdiffusive: the variance of the displacement grows with time as t * with 1 < 3 ' < 2. The dependence of the diffusion exponent 3 ' and the scaling of the probability distributions are investigated for periodic and chaotic flow regimes, {{and the results are}} found to be consistent with theoretical predictions relating L 6 vy flights and anomalous diffusion. For a turbulent flow, the L 6 vy flight description no longer applies, and mixing no longer appears superdiffusive. 1...|$|E

Destructive analysis techniques {{were used for}} quantification of the fissile material content of the tanks. With termination of operations in 1989, including sparging and sampling of tanks, a need arose for nondestructive assay of solutions in tanks to confirm previous inventory values. Gamma ray measurement methodologies were investigated and several techniques, including Poor Man`s Densitometry were implemented. These techniques have been applied to several different types of <b>tanks</b> including: <b>annular,</b> raschig ring filled, and pencil <b>tanks.</b> For the <b>annular</b> <b>tanks</b> ``Poor Man`s Densitometry`` is used, with the densities of the measured solutions normalized {{to the value of}} one ``accepted`` concentration tank. Measurement uncertainties for this technique has been better than was anticipated. Measurements are also performed at several levels to attempt to detect variations in density. For the current tank draining program, solution in tanks is assayed by the NDA gamma-ray technique before draining. Measurement results were obtained for plutonium, uranium, and mixtures of U/Pu solutions for concentrations ranging from less than 0. 5 g/l to 150 g/l. Tanks with expected concentrations were used to establish a relationship between concentration and count rate. ``Bootstrapping`` calibration techniques were used in some cases to obtain quantitative results...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} experimental {{observations of}} fully developed, large-amplitude bars under {{the action of}} a shearing fluid. The experiments were performed in an <b>annular</b> <b>tank</b> filled with water and sheared above by a steady motor source. The same steady shearing flow can produce {{a variety of different}} erodible bed manifestations: advective or precessive bars, which refer to bar structures with global regularity and a near-steady precession velocity; interactive bars, the structure of which depends on local rearrangements, which are in turn a response to complex background topography; and dispersive bars, which are created when an initially isolated mound of sand evolves into a train of sand ripples. Of these, the most amenable to analysis are the precessive bars. For precession bars, we find that the skin depth, which is the nondimensionalized mean-field transport rate, grows exponentially {{as a function of the}} shear velocity. From this, we arrive at an analytical expression that approximates the precession speed of the bars as a function of shear velocity. We use this to obtain a formula for sediment transport rate. However, in intense flows, the bars can get large engendering boundary layer separation, leading to a different dynamic for bar formation and evolution. Numerical flow calculations over an experimentally obtained set of precessive bars are presented and show that classical parametrizations of mass flux in terms of bottom gradients have shortcomings. Within the range of shear rates considered, a quantity that does not change appreciably in time is the aspect ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the average bar amplitude, with respect to a mean depth, to the average bar length.

40|$|Abstract. Thermodynamic {{analysis}} and numerical modeling of hurricane intensity {{has shown that}} it is sensitive to enthalpy and momentum transfer from the ocean surface. Direct measurements of drag are not easily performed on the high seas. Therefore, an annular wind wave tank has been constructed in which aspects of a tropical storm boundary layer were simulated. The air velocity inside the <b>annular</b> <b>tank</b> is {{comparable to that of}} a hurricane. This paper focuses mainly on the design and engineering of the tank, the fluid mechanics of the rotational flow in the tank using angular momentum analysis, the design of experiments, and experimental results. It provides experimental data on drag and latent, sensible and total enthalpy transfer at high air speed relative to the moving water surface. The design of the wind-wave tank and the experiments create a foundation for future and more comprehensive high air speed experimental programs using a linear tank. Key Words: Air-sea interaction, spray, tropical cyclones, heat and momentum transfer. 1. Experimental Apparatus and introduction A circular wind wave tank made of two acrylic concentric walls was constructed, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The water height can be varied in the annulus. A windvane, powered by a 1 kW electric motor, moves the air over the water surface. The shear over the water surface propels the water. An Acoustic Doppler Velocitmeter (ADV) measures the water velocity. An anemometer measures the air velocity. The tank is equipped with an adjustable false bottom that enables the distance from the windvane paddle to the water surface to be varied for the same depth of water. The tank is also equipped with apparatus to conduct enthalpy transfer experiments. All the experiments used Poland SpringTM water to minimize variations in water properties...|$|E
40|$|The AP 600 passive {{containment}} vessel {{is surrounded by}} a concrete cylindrical shell covered with a truncated conical roof. This roof supports the passive containment cooling system (PCS) <b>annular</b> <b>tank,</b> shield plate and other nonstructural attachments. When the shield building is subjected to different loading combinations as defined in the Standard Review Plan (SRP), some of the sections in the shield building could experience forces in excess of their design values. This report summarized the three-dimensional finite element analysis that was conducted to review the adequacy of the proposed Westinghouse shield building design. The ANSYS finite element software was utilized to analyze the Shield Building Roof (SBR) under dead, snow, wind, thermal and seismic loadings. A three-dimensional model that included a portion of the shield building cylindrical shell, the conical roof and its attachments, the eccentricities at the cone-cylinder connection and at the compression ring and the PCS tank was developed. Mesh sensitivity studies were conducted to select appropriate element size in the cylinder, cone, near air intakes and {{in the vicinity of the}} eccentricities. Also, a study was carried out to correctly idealize the water-structure interaction in the PCS tank. Response spectrum analysis was used to calculate the internal forces at different sections in the SBR under Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE). Forty-nine structural modes and twenty sloshing modes were used. Two horizontal components of the SSE together with a vertical component were used. Modal stress resultants were combined taking into account the effects of closely spaced modes. The three earthquake directions were combined by the Square Root of the Sum Squares method. Two load combinations were studied. The load combination that included dead, snow, fluid, thermal and seismic loads was selected to be the most critical. Interaction diagrams for critical sections were developed and used to check the design adequacy. The results demonstrated that provided area of steal on each face of several sections of the AP 600 SBR was inadequate. This was also noticed when comparing the total provided area of steel per section, i. e., the area of steel on both faces. The discrepancy between Westinghouse results and these reported herein could have resulted from the different finite element mesh sizes and the assumption used in Westinghouse design...|$|E
40|$|Both {{laboratory}} {{measurements and}} numerical modelling have been undertaken {{to investigate the}} wave-enhanced air-water constituent transfer with a special focus on the Schmidt number exponent (n).

Highly enriched uranyl nitrate solution was introduced into a 1 - 3 linear array of nested stainless steel <b>annular</b> <b>tanks.</b> The tanks were inside a concrete enclosure, with various moderator and absorber materials placed inside and/or between the tanks. These moderators and absorbers included boron-free concrete, borated concrete, borated plaster, and cadmium.

Another experiment involved nested hemispheres of highly enriched uranium placed between tanks externally. These three configurations are not evaluated in this report. The experiments evaluated here {{are part of a}} series of experiments, one set of which is evaluated in HEU-SOL-THERM- 033. The experiments in this and HEU-SOL-THERM- 033 were performed similarly.

Increasing the Reynolds number resulted in successive transitions to lower modes where time-dependent behaviour was only found for flows with three or less vortices. Previous numerical simulations of a related experiment, using a two-dimensional spectral model of the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation incorporating Ekman forcing and viscous dissipation, suggested that the boundary conditions at the inner cylinder of the domain could significantly affect the interior flow by the generation and shedding of vorticity at this inner boundary.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in using ultrasonic guided waves to assess the structural degradation of above-ground storage tank floors. This is a non-invasive and economically viable means of assessing structural degradation. Above-ground storage tank floors are ageing assets which need to be inspected periodically to avoid structural failure. At present, normal-stress type transducers are bonded to the <b>tank</b> <b>annular</b> chime to generate a force field in the thickness direction of the floor and excite fundamental symmetric and asymmetric Lamb modes. However, the majority of above-ground storage tanks in use have no annular chime due to a simplified design and/or have a degraded chime due to corrosion. This means that transducers cannot be mounted on the chime to assess structural health according to the present technology, and the market share of structural health monitoring of above-ground storage tank floors using ultrasonic guided wave is thus limited. Therefore, {{the present study investigates}} the potential of using the tank wall to bond the transducer instead of the <b>tank</b> <b>annular</b> chime. Both normal and shear type transducers were investigated numerically, and results were validated using a 4. 1 m diameter above-ground storage tank. The study results show shear mode type transducers bonded to the tank wall can be used to assess the structural health of the above-ground tank floors using an ultrasonic guided wave.

40|$|Active {{thermography}} {{has been}} used for almost 30 years to explore air-sea gas transfer both in laboratory and field experiments. In the early 2000 s, some doubt arose whether it was possible to extrapolate heat transfer velocities to gas transfer velocities. Because of the large difference in the molecular diffusivity, different mechanisms may govern the transfer of heat and mass. However, in a recent experimental study at the large <b>annular</b> wind-wave <b>tank</b> in Heidelberg, the Aeolotron, Nagel et al. [2014] could show that heat transfer velocities can be scaled to gas transfer velocities with an accuracy of better than 10 %, provided the Schmidt number exponent is known. These measurements were performed using the original active thermographic technique proposed by JÃ¤hne et al. [1989], by heating a rather large area at the water surface of up to one square meter. This is required to ensure that water parcels stay longer in the heated patch than the response time of heat transfer across the boundary layer. The setup used by Nagel et al. [2014] still had one disadvantage. The heated patch showed some inhomogeneity in cross-wind direction, caused by the method to expand the beam of the CO 2 laser. By using a holographic beam expander, a much more homogeneous irradiation could be achieved. With this improvement it was possible to acquire significantly more accurate heat transfer measurements. In November 2014 this technique was used in air-sea gas exchange measurements using natural seawater from the North Atlantic with various degrees of contamination by natural surface films at the Heidelberg Aeolotron, within the BMBF project SOPRAN (Surface Ocean Processes in the Anthropocene).

With the advent of high frequency guided waves, short range inspections with high spatial resolution for monitoring corrosion under pipe supports and <b>tank</b> <b>annular</b> plates has gained widespread interest and acceptance. One of the major challenges in the application of high frequency guided waves in a short range inspection is to attain the desired modal displacements with respect to the application. In this paper, an investigation on the generation and formation of fundamental S 0 mode is carried out through numerical simulation and experiments to establish a prenatal zone for guided waves. The effect of frequency, thickness of the plate and frequency-thickness (f*d) is studied. The investigation reveals the existence of a rudimentary form with similar modal features to the fully developed mode. This study helps in the design and development of a high frequency guided wave generator for particular applications which demands waves with very less sensitivity to the surface and loading during the initial phase which immediately evolves to a more sensitive wave towards the surface on propagation for the detection of shallow defects...|$|R
