5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid.</b> In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.|$|E

5000|$|The β6/α6 loop region {{interacts with}} the {{substrate}} and regulates access to the active site. Phe147, Gly148, and Ala149 of this region cap the active site once binding has occurred. In addition, the Fe2+ ion is coordinated to His35, His70, Asp37, Asp175, and oxygens O2 and O3 of the substrate. [...] The binding of substrate atoms to the iron cation helps stabilize the complex during catalysis. Mutagenesis studies have also indicated that two <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> are located within the active site and help mediate catalysis through a 1,1-proton transfer reaction. [...] The <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> are the acid/base catalysts. Lastly, once the ligand {{is attached to the}} active site, a series of methionines (Met39, Met72, and Met141) restrict further movement through constriction.|$|R
5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (aspartate) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common amino acids in the typical diet. As with {{methanol}} and phenylalanine, intake of <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid.</b> There has been some speculation that aspartame, in conjunction with other amino acids like glutamate, may lead to excitotoxicity, inflicting damage on brain and nerve cells. However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects, and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.|$|E

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of glutamic and <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> were {{measured in the}} dialysate obtained with vertical microdialysis probes implanted into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of sexually potent male rats during sexual activity. Animals showed noncontact erections when put in the presence of, and copulated with, a receptive (ovarietomized oestrogen- and progesterone-primed) female rat. The {{concentrations of}} glutamic and <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> in the paraventricular dialysate increased by 37 and 80 %, respectively, above baseline values during exposure to the receptive female rat and by 55 and 127 %, respectively, during copulation. No changes in the concentrations of glutamic and <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> were detected in the paraventricular dialysate when sexually potent male rats were exposed to nonreceptive (ovariectomized not oestrogen- and progesterone-primed) female rats or when impotent male rats were used. The injection into the paraventricular nucleus of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist dizocilpine (5 micro g), a noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, reduced noncontact erections and significantly impaired copulatory activity. The alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionic acid receptor antagonist 6 -cyano- 7 -nitro-quinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (5 micro g) was also able to impair copulatory activity, but to a much lower extent than dizocilpine. In contrast, (+/-) - 2 -amino- 4 -phosphono-butanoic acid, a metabotropic receptor antagonist (5 micro g), {{was found to be}} ineffective. These results confirm the involvement of the paraventricular nucleus in the control of erectile function and copulatory behaviour and show that excitatory amino acid concentration increases in the paraventricular nucleus when penile erection occurs in physiological contexts...|$|R
40|$|Sucrose-specific porin (ScrY) is a {{transmembrane protein}} {{that allows for}} the uptake of sucrose under growth-limiting conditions. The crystal {{structure}} of ScrY was resolved before by X-ray crystallography, both in its uncomplexed form and with bound sucrose. However, {{little is known about}} the molecular characteristics of the transport mechanism of ScrY. To date, there has not yet been any clear demonstration for sucrose transport through the ScrY. Here, the dynamics of the ScrY trimer embedded in a phospholipid bilayer as well as the characteristics of sucrose translocation were investigated by means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The potential of mean force (PMF) for sucrose translocation through the pore showed two main energy barriers within the constriction region of ScrY. Energy decomposition allowed to pinpoint three <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> as key residues opposing the passage of sucrose, all located within the L 3 loop. Mutation of two <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> to uncharged residues resulted in an accordingly modified electrostatics and decreased PMF barrier.

25|$|While known {{aspects of}} {{synthesis}} {{are covered by}} patents, many details are proprietary. Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected by converting it to a functional group that will not interfere in the next reaction. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the N-protected aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> links to phenylalanine. A process using an enzyme from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, {{which has not been}} used commercially, uses unmodified <b>aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.|$|E

50|$|Interaction {{with both}} <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> {{in the active}} site results in a higher {{affinity}}. Higher affinity also results by occupying more active site pockets. However, some pockets contribute more to the affinity than others. A hydrophobic interaction with the S3sp subpocket, S1 and S3 contribute to higher potency and affinity. By having a large and aromatic residue in P3 increases inhibitory activity. Occupation of the S3sp subpocket can increase potency by 50-fold and results in tight binding.|$|R

40|$|Clostridium novyi alpha-toxin {{belongs to}} the family of large clostridial cytotoxins which act on cells through the {{modification}} of small GTP-binding proteins. We present here an analysis of the catalytic domain of alpha-toxin. A NH 2 -terminal 551 -amino-acid fragment, α 551, was found to contain the full enzyme activity of the holotoxin, whereas a slightly shortened fragment encompassing 509 amino acids showed no detectable enzyme activity. Further characterization of the enzymatically active fragment α 551 revealed a substrate specificity for both UDP–N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucose. A Michaelis-Menten constant of 17 μM was determined for the substrate UDP–N-acetylglucosamine, while that for UDP-glucose was about 20 times higher, indicating a weaker affinity of the toxin for the latter substrate. Mutation of the <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> of a conserved motif DXD within α 551 reduced enzyme activity > 700 -fold and inhibited cytotoxicity after microinjection in cells. Inhibition of enzyme activity of the DXD mutant could be partially overcome by increased concentrations of manganese ions, suggesting the involvement of these <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> in Mn 2 + binding.

To complement {{previous studies of}} the glutamic acid and histidine residues in Bacillus circulans xylanase (BCX), we have used NMR methods to measure the pKa s of the seven <b>aspartic</b> <b>acids</b> and the C-terminus of this protein. The pKa s of these carboxyls are all less than the corresponding values observed with random coil polypeptides, indicating that their ionization contributes favorably to {{the stability of the}} folded enzyme.

Most dramatically, Asp 83 and Asp 101 have pKa s < 2 and thus remain deprotonated in native BCX under all conditions examined. Asp 83 is completely buried, forming a strong salt bridge with Arg 136. In contrast, Asp 101 is located {{on the surface of the}} protein, stabilized in the deprotonated form by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds involving an internal water molecule and the neutral side-chain and main-chain atoms of Ser 100 and Thr 145.
