40|$|The Phenomenological {{reflection}} of visual artifact {{methods such as}} the possibility of safe treatment of disturbing emotions of the child. Theoretical Foundations of salutogenetic use of Phenomenological {{reflection of}} visual artifact methods. Jiří Závora Abstract: The Phenomenological reflection of an authentic visual artifact represents a non- directive method enabling, {{in the framework of}} the salutogenetic support of individual protective features (framework: hardiness, resilience and sense of coherency), to cope with disquieting emotions. The functional viability of the method, confirmed at the theoretical modelling level, consists in evocating and maintaining a direct experience of the reflected phenomena and their authentic thematic representation. In the course of <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> <b>experience,</b> the disquieting <b>emotion</b> is made Avare through relating it to the artifact in question. In this way, the emotion is thematized at the level of somatic experience, its character "felt shift" and a long term personality change occurs. The aim of the project is to assess the various aspects of the functional viability of introspection as the underlying approach. It is applied for examining the somatic experience in the course of phenomenological reflection of visual artifact as the chief object of study. Key words: [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the impact of emotion regulation on the intensity bias in guilt and shame. Fifty-two undergraduates either forecasted their emotions and emotion regulation following a guilt- and shame-eliciting situation or reported their <b>actual</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>emotions</b> and employed emotion regulation. Results showed a clear intensity bias, that is, forecasters predicted to experience more guilt and shame than experiencers actually experienced. Furthermore, results showed that forecasters predicted to employ less down-regulating emotion regulation (i. e. less acceptance) and more up-regulating emotion regulation (i. e. more rumination) than experiencers actually employed. Moreover, {{results showed that the}} intensity differences between forecasted and experienced guilt and shame could be explained (i. e. were mediated) by the differences between forecasted and actually employed emotion regulation (i. e. acceptance and rumination). These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the intensity bias can—at least in part—be explained by the misprediction of future emotion regulation...|$|R

30|$|Participants {{rated their}} {{emotions}} at multiple {{points in the}} study. To encourage consistency in emotion ratings, we used a method deployed in a similar study (Isaacs et al. 2013).

We asked them to assign <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> to each number on the scale. On completion, the results were saved and accessible via a hyperlink, allowing access to the scale throughout the study. We encouraged participants to continue consulting this scale in weekly check-in interviews.|$|R

Moments after he drove away, he wrote that he saw a police car with the dogs drive by.

60|$|In Lecture I we {{criticized the}} {{analysis}} of a presentation into act, content and object.

But it is necessary first to complete our preliminary requisites, and then to examine the content of a belief. After that, we shall {{be in a position to}} return to the question as to what constitutes believing.|$|R

After becoming popular among Harvard undergraduates, it was translated into a mock Italian operetta, [...] "Il Pesceballo", by faculty members Francis James Child, James Russell Lowell and John Knowles Paine, set to a pastiche of grand opera music, and performed in Boston and Cambridge to raise funds for the Union army.A fish ball was for breakfast, a cooked fish and potatoes pan fried together, in New England.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sensation}} {{scene of}} the original play is deconstructed in act four. Following the act three climax: the plot lines must converge, the moral is made clear, and the audience has to be hit with a [...] "theatre trick" [...] which overwhelms the audience with technical elements. Rather than execute this, the actors explain and act out what happens. BJJ clarifies that {{in the time of}} play, a photograph was a novel/innovative/contemporary way for the plot to be resolved. In An Octoroon, the projection of a [...] "lynching photograph" [...] is an attempt towards <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> of finality. <b>A</b> photograph of a real murdered human contrasts with the original play's use of a photograph for justice.|$|R
5000|$|The Swedish {{lyrics of}} [...] "Boten Anna" [...] {{tell the story}} of a female IRC bot by the vocalist who later finds out the truth; subsequently, however, he states that she will always remain a bot in his eyes.

His friend said he would create a bot with {{administrative}} capabilities to keep order in his channel, #BassHunter.se; when this happened Jonas saw a new user with administrative capabilities named [...] "Anna" [...] enter the channel, and naturally thought this was the bot. Months later, he learned that Anna was actually not a bot, but was his friend's girlfriend; the embarrassment, he says, inspired him to create the song.|$|R

The model is based on the common sardine and anchovies artisanal fisheries of central – southern Chile and it is used to analyze <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> of quota re-distribution between artisanal fishers.

Verne himself and another historical individual, Count Ermanno Stradelli, replace the book’s male protagonists, leaving the androgynous heroine as the other point in the triangle. The modernist dimension of gender roles becomes {{the basis for a}} metaphorical exploration of the source of sexual identity that parallels the journey to the source of the Orinoco. 1888 –EL EXTRAORDINARIO VIAJE DE JULES VERNE {{is also one of the}} few non-documentary films in which Verne is brought to the screen, becoming here part of the creation of his own text, tapping the sources of inspiration, of love, and of identity.
