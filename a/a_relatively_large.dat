5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large,</b> muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650grams of {{promethium}} per year and was the world's only large-volume synthesis facility. Gram-scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, but will possibly be resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. Currently, Russia {{is the only country}} producing promethium-147 on <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> scale.|$|E

50|$|Aristonectidae were {{characterized}} by <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> head and shorter neck than the Plesiosauridae and Elasmosauridae. Teeth resemble those of the Plesiosauridae. The group is known only from scanty and fragmentary remains.|$|R
5|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> {{difference}} in the electronegativity of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state going down carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the +4 state.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> direct {{band gap}} of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages {{associated}} with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution, Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then {{a booming}} Ohio River port. In 1787, {{he was elected}} to the Virginia state {{assembly}} as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, he kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is one of}} {{the four}} most-spoken Berber languages, in {{addition}} to Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff, and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Differentiating these dialects is {{complicated by the fact that}} speakers of other languages may also refer to their language as 'Tamazight'. The differences between all three groups are largely phonological and lexical, rather than syntactic. Tamazight itself has <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> degree of internal diversity, including whether spirantization occurs.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> amount of {{juvenile}} material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is {{from at least}} two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E
50|$|Goodwin's broad-clawed shrew (Cryptotis goodwini) is {{a species}} of mammal in the Soricidae (Shrew) family. Body length and size of adults average 9.49 cm and 7.0 grams {{respectively}} making it <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> shew. What distinguishes this from other shrews are its long claws.|$|R

5|$|In 1968, Richard Nixon, the United States Republican Party nominee, won {{the presidential}} election, {{defeating}} Democrat Hubert Humphrey by seven-tenths {{of a percent}} of the popular vote. Nixon appointed H. R. Haldeman as his Chief of Staff; this position granted Haldeman <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> degree of control over the activities of the presidential administration. Haldeman had first worked for Nixon in 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice-presidency under Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels {{continued}} in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E
5|$|It is most {{convenient}} {{to compare the}} various local weight standards by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5g) around the typical value of 30g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25g to 31g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28g. But there is <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> gap between the troy ounces of 31g and the Habsburg ounce of 35g. The latter {{is the product of}} an 18th-century weight reform.|$|E

Similarly, if joints A 1 and A 3 rotate a smaller angle, the end-effector also outputs <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> rotational angle φ and the PM has 1 -DOF rotation {R(N,ν)} about v axis as shown in Figure  11 (c).|$|R
5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} typhoon intensity, Kirogi began to undergo rapid intensification. Roughly 18hours later, the JTWC {{reported that the}} storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 215km/h (135mph 1-minute sustained), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. By this time, the typhoon was situated roughly 870km (540mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm featured a 59km (37mi) wide symmetrical eye. Early on July5, the JMA reported that Kirogi attained its peak intensity with winds of 155km/h (100mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 940mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). The storm was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> typhoon, with a gale diameter of 520km (325mi).|$|E
5|$|Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys until 1926, when they adopted the {{green and white}} hooped strip that they have worn ever since.

5|$|With a {{population}} of 2,560 in 1945, Deir al-Balah was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> village. The influx of Palestinian refugees from nearby areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War drastically increased the population thereafter. In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Deir al-Balah's population was recorded as 42,839, a figure which included the adjacent Deir al-Balah Camp (the smallest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.) Nearly 75% of the population were below the age of 30.|$|E
5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Like all fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{an active}} and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, its balance assisted by <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
40|$|Macroscelidids have {{relatively}} short digestive tracts, {{consistent with their}} insectivorous diet. Compared with five species of Elephantulus, Macroscelides proboscideus had <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> long <b>large</b> intestine and Petrodromus tetradactylus had <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> short <b>large</b> intestine.
