5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>on</b> the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it started to see some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>on</b> the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally very supportive of market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E

Analyses such as this interpret the governmental propositions for Internet users and promote democracy by allowing all the opportunity to agree or disagree with the proposition prior to its ruling. This analysis is posted publicly on the Internet, in compliance with the mission of CDT, and addresses each section of the Data Protection Regulation and the potential pitfalls of each article.

500|$|Writing in Conflict Quarterly for The Journal of Conflict Studies, David Charters {{questioned}} why {{the book}} did not present more of <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>on</b> the aggregate impact {{of all of}} the disinformation campaigns, before noting such a task would be difficult to assess. The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, [...] "Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, or were they merely of nuisance value?" [...] Conflict Quarterly criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, [...] "Without answers to questions such as these, it is difficult to accept, at face value, the authors' conclusions." [...] Charters concluded the book was [...] "a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which... is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.|$|E

[...] The New Orleans Picayune (10 April 1892) published Wolseley's ten-page portrayal of Forrest, which condensed much of what was written about him by biographers of the time. [...] This work appeared in the Journal of the Southern Historical Society in the same year, and is commonly cited today. [...] Wolseley addressed Forrest's role at the Battle of Fort Pillow near Memphis, Tennessee in April, 1864 in which black USCT troops and white officers were alleged by some to have been slaughtered after Fort Pillow had been conquered. [...] Wolseley wrote, [...] "I do not think that the fact that one-half of the small garrison of a place taken by assault was either killed or wounded evinced any very unusual bloodthirstiness {{on the part of the}} assailants." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Switch uses a {{system-on-chip}} {{from the}} Tegra family of products, developed {{in partnership with}} Nvidia.
