40|$|The focal cone {{electroretinogram}} is {{a sensitive}} marker for macular disease, but have we unlocked its full potential? Typically assessment of waveform parameters is subjective {{and focuses on}} {{a small number of}} locations (e. g. the a-wave). This study evaluated the discriminatory and diagnostic potential of 4 conventional and 15 novel, objectively determined, parameters in patients with early Age-related Macular Degeneration. Focal cone electroretinograms were recorded in 54 participants with early Age-related Macular Degeneration (72. 9 ± 8. 2 years) and 54 healthy controls (69 ± 7. 7 years). Conventional a and b wave amplitudes and implicit times were measured and compared to novel parameters derived from both the 1 st and 2 nd derivatives and the frequency-domain power spectrum of the electroretinogram. Statistically significant differences between groups were shown for <b>all</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>parameters,</b> the majority of 1 st and 2 nd derivative parameters and the power spectrum at 25 and 30 Hz. Receiver operating characteristics showed that both conventional and 1 st and 2 nd derivative implicit times had provided the best diagnostic potential. A regression model showed a small improvement over any individual parameter investigated. The non-conventional parameters enhanced the objective evaluation of the focal electroretinogram, especially when the amplitude was low. Furthermore, the novel parameters described here allow the implicit time of the electroretinogram to be probed at points other than the peaks of the a and b waves. Consequently these novel analysis techniques could prove valuable in future electrophysiological investigation, detection and monitoring of Age-related Macular Degeneration...|$|E
40|$|Both {{acute and}} chronic forms of {{psychological}} stress {{have been proposed}} as precipitants of sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease. However few information has been gained so far, {{about the effects of}} acute psychological stress in patients with ventricular preexcitation (WPW). Indeed such evaluation could be relevant to define the individual arrhythmic risk in WPW. In this study 40 patients with WPW syndrome and otherwise normal hearts were investigated, most of them for agonistic sports aptitude assessment. Psychological profiling was carried out with M. H. e., Wartegg, Toulouse-Pieron and Banati-Fischer tests. <b>All</b> <b>conventional</b> EP <b>parameters</b> were quantified, by trans-esophageal pacing, under basal conditions and during 6 minutes of mental stress (a modified colour-word conflict task). The combined effect of mental stress, postural changes and physical effort was evaluated as well. Average ERPs of Kent and AV Node were both shortened by mental stress. This effect however was statistically significant only at rest, in the upright position, at drive cycles of 600, 400 ms (p < 0. 05) and 320 ms (p < 0. 01). A proarrhythmic effect was observed in 6 subjects, being AF (3 cases) or AVRT (3 cases) inducible only during mental stress. Psychological profiling evidenced that proarrhythmic modification of electrophysiological parameters induced during mental stress occurred in individuals with a lack of aggressivity integration or blocked psychic energy, which results in a poor ''coping'' capability Conclusions: Individual personality traits and coping style should be evaluated as an independent risk factor, because they could play a pathogenic role for the occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias in WPW patients, especially when engaged in agonistic sports or risky occupations implying strong emotional involvemen...|$|R
40|$|Background: The novel urinary {{neutrophil}} gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) is {{an early}} and highly predictive biomarker that is rapidly released in acute kidney injury (AKI). Objective: We investigated the early expression of uNGAL (first 4  days after injury) {{as a predictor of}} acute kidney injury complicating circulatory shock. Methods: Urinary-NGAL level was measured in collected urine samples of 45 patients (pts) with circulatory shock, during the first 6  h and after 24  h of onset of shock. Eleven patients responded to fluid infusion ± vasopressors and were considered as a control group. Results: The estimated uNGAL at day 1 and day 2, could predict AKI presenting at days 2, 3 and 4 (P <  0. 05, < 0. 001 and < 0. 001, < 0. 001), respectively. Apart from <b>all</b> <b>conventional</b> kidney <b>parameters</b> and biomarkers, significant inverse correlations could be detected only between uNGAL at days 1 and 2 with the corresponding urine output in the patients’ group (r = − 0. 41 and − 0. 64, P <  0. 05 and < 0. 001, respectively). The best cutoff value of uNGAL at day 1 was 26  ng/mL, with sensitivity and specificity of (62 % and 69 %) and (75 % and 80 %), for prediction of AKI presented at days 2 and 3, respectively. While the best cutoff at day 2 was 29  ng/mL, with sensitivity and specificity of (70 % and 74 %) and (90 % and 80 %) for prediction of AKI diagnosed at days 3 and 4, respectively.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) treatment offers {{a viable option}} for high-risk patient categories. Our aim is to evaluate whether 2 D strain and strain rate can detect subtle improvement in global and regional LV systolic function immediately after TAVI. 2 D conventional and 2 D strain (speckle analysis) echocardiography was performed before, at discharge and after three months in thirty three patients with severe AS. After TAVI, we assessed by conventional echocardiography an immediate reduction of transaortic peak pressure gradient (p< 0. 0001), of mean pressure gradient (p< 0. 0001) and a concomitant increase in aortic valve area (AVA: 1. 08 ± 0. 31 cm 2 /m 2; p< 0. 0001). 2 D longitudinal systolic strain showed a significant improvement in all patients, both at septal and lateral level, as early as 72 h after procedure (septal: - 14. 2 ± 5. 1 vs - 16. 7 ± 3. 7 %, p< 0. 001; lateral: - 9. 4 ± 3. 9 vs - 13. 1 ± 4. 5 %, p< 0. 001; respectively) and continued at 3 months follow-up (septal: - 18. 1 ± 4. 6 %, p< 0. 0001; lateral: - 14. 8 ± 4. 4 %, p< 0. 0001; respectively). Conventional echocardiography after TAVI proved a significant reduction of LV end-systolic volume and of LV mass with a mild improvement of LV ejection fraction (EF) (51. 2 ± 11. 8 vs 52. 9 ± 6. 4 %; p< 0. 02) only after three months. 2 D strain seems {{to be able to}} detect subtle changes in LV systolic function occurring early and late after TAVI in severe AS, while <b>all</b> <b>conventional</b> echo <b>parameters</b> seem to be less effective for this purpose.

We found that sperm MMP was significantly positively correlated with <b>all</b> of <b>conventional</b> semen <b>parameters</b> including semen volume (r = 0. 090, p = 0. 025), sperm concentration (r = 0. 301, p< 0. 01), total sperm count (r = 0. 324, p< 0. 01), and progressive motility (r = 0. 399, p< 0. 01); sperm MMP was also negatively correlated with Annexin V+ sperm (r = - 0. 553, p< 0. 01); mtDNAcn was significantly negatively correlated with sperm concentration (r = - 0. 214, p< 0. 01), total sperm count (r = - 0. 232, p< 0. 01), and progressive motility (r = - 0. 164, p = 0. 01); mtDNA integrity was also significantly positively correlated with sperm concentration (r = 0. 195, p< 0. 01), total sperm count (r = 0. 185, p< 0. 01), and progressive motility (r = 0. 106, p = 0. 043). After adjusting for potential confounders, these relationships remained significant. Furthermore, we explored the potential effects of lifestyles on such mitochondrial biomarkers {{and found that the}} current drinkers displayed a higher level of sperm MMP; additionally, mt DNAcn was increased with age.

40|$|In {{gas turbine}} {{performance}} simulations often the question arises: What {{is the best}} thermodynamic cycle design point? This is an optimization task which can be attacked in two ways: One can do a series of parameter variations and pick from the resulting graphs the best solution or one can employ numerical optimization algorithms that produce a single cycle which fulfills <b>all</b> constraints. The <b>conventional</b> <b>parameter</b> study builds strongly on the engineering judgement and gives useful information over a range of parameter selections. However, when values {{for more than a}} few variables have to be determined while several constraints are existing, then numerical optimization routines can help to find the mathematical optimum faster and more accurately. Sometimes even an outstanding solution is found which was overlooked while doing a preliminary parameter study. For any simulation task a sophisticated graphical user interface is of great benefit. This is especially true for automated numerical optimizations. It is quite helpful to see on the screen of a PC how the variables are changing and which constraints are limiting the design. A quick and clear graphical representation of trade studies is also of great advantage. The paper describes how numerical optimization and parameter studies are implemented in a Windows-based PC program. As an example, the cycle selection of a derivative turbofan engine with a given core shows the merits of numerical optimization. The parameter variation is best suited for presenting the sensitivity of the result in the neighborhood of the optimum cycle design point. 1...|$|R

Using Cox regression and an individual risk quantification in a cohort of 508 patients following myocardial infarction we could predict death or recussitation during a two year follow-up with a sensitivity of 59 % and a specificity of 93 %. <b>Conventional</b> <b>parameters</b> resulted in a sensitivity of only 18 %.

40|$|AIMS: Current {{attempts}} of improving patient selection in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are mainly based on echocardiographic timing of myocardial velocity peaks. Regional myocardial function is neglected. Apical transverse motion (ATM) {{is a new}} parameter to quantify apical rocking as an integrative surrogate of both temporal and functional inhomogeneities within the left ventricle. In this study, we tested the predictive value of apical rocking for response to CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients eligible for CRT were assessed by echocardiography before and 11 ± 5 months after pacemaker implantation. Response was defined as left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume decrease > 15 %. Rocking was quantified (ATM) and visually assessed by four blinded readers. Predictive value for CRT response of both assessments was compared with <b>conventional</b> dyssynchrony <b>parameters.</b> ATM in the four-chamber view plane differentiated best between responders and non-responders (2. 2 ± 1. 5 vs. 0. 06 ± 1. 9 mm, P< 0. 0001). Quantified ATM predicted reverse remodelling with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 75, 96, and 83 % whereas visual rocking assessment resulted in 89, 75, and 83 %, respectively. The accuracy of <b>conventional</b> <b>parameters</b> was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Apical rocking is a new marker to assess LV dyssynchrony and predict CRT response.
