40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the efficacy and safety of <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography in inducing myocardial ischemia and detecting coronary artery disease. Background. Exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography are clinically accepted techniques for detecting coronary artery disease. <b>Arbutamine</b> is a new synthetic beta-adrenoceptor agonist developed specifically as a stress agent. <b>Arbutamine</b> is delivered by a new computerized drug delivery device that adjusts the rate of drug infusion according to the patient's heart rate response during stress testing. Methods. The sensitivity of <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography was determined in 143 patients who had coronary artery disease documented by coronary angiography. A subset of these patients (n = 114) also underwent exercise echocardiography. The specificity, or normalcy, of <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography was determined in 54 patients considered to have a low likelihood of coronary artery disease. Results. Among those patients who had both stress test results, the incidence of inducing myocardial ischemia (new or worsening wall motion abnormalities) was 79 % (95 % confidence interval [ci] 69 % to 86 %, n = 98) for <b>arbutamine</b> and 77 % (95 % CI 67 % to 85 %, n = 98) for exercise echocardiography. The sensitivity of detecting coronary artery disease (ischemia or rest wall motion abnormality) was 87 % (95 % CI 79 % to 93 %, n = 101) for <b>arbutamine</b> and 83 % (95 % CI 74 % to 90 %, n = 101) for exercise echocardiography. The specificity (normalcy) of <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography was 96 % (95 % CI 87 % to 100 %, n = 52). <b>Arbutamine</b> was well tolerated, {{and there were no}} serious adverse events. Conclusions. <b>Arbutamine</b> echocardiography is an effective and safe pharmacologic stress test technique for diagnosing or excluding the presence of coronary artery disease.

Methods. <b>Arbutamine</b> was administered by a novel computerized closed-loop device that measures heart rate and adjusts <b>arbutamine</b> infusion to achieve a selected rate of heart rate increase toward a predetermined limit. The cohort included 184 patients who underwent <b>arbutamine</b> stress testing, of whom 122 (catheterization group) had angiographically defined coronary artery disease (≥ 50 % diameter stenosis of a major coronary artery), and 62 had a low pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease (low likelihood group). A subset of 69 patients from the catheterization group underwent both <b>arbutamine</b> and exercise stress testing. Results. Hemodynamic responses during <b>arbutamine</b> and exercise stress testing demonstrated no significant difference in percent increase in heart rate (81 % vs. 76 %) or systolic blood pressure (26 % vs. 30 %). The sensitivity for detecting coronary artery disease (≥ 50 % stenosis) using <b>arbutamine</b> thallium- 201 SPECT was 87 % (95 % for detecting ≥ 70 % stenoses), and the normalcy rate in the low likelihood group was 90 %. In patients completing both <b>arbutamine</b> and exercise stress testing, thallium- 201 SPECT sensitivity for detecting coronary artery disease (≥ 50 % stenosis) was 94 % and 97 % (p = NS), respectively. Furthermore, SPECT segmental visual score agreement (defect vs. no defect) showed a concordance of 92 % between <b>arbutamine</b> and exercise results (kappa 0. 80, p < 0. 001). The stress thallium- 201 SPECT segmental scores showed 83 % exact agreement (kappa 0. 69, p < 0. 001), and analysis of the reversibility of segments with stress perfusion defects demonstrated 86 % exact agreement (kappa 0. 68, p < 0. 001). In general, side effects associated with <b>arbutamine</b> were well tolerated and resolved with discontinuation of infusion. Conclusions. <b>Arbutamine,</b> administered by a closed-loop feedback system was shown to be a safe and effective pharmacologic stress agent. <b>Arbutamine</b> stress thallium- 201 SPECT appears to be accurate for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease with a diagnostic efficacy similar to that of treadmill exercise thallium- 201 studies...|$|E
40|$|Objective -This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography in identifying contractile reserve and predicting functional improvement early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods and results - Seventeen patients with first AMI underwent <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography 48 to 96 hours after AMI. <b>Arbutamine</b> was infused by a closed-loop delivery device. The heart rate slope was 4 beats/min and the heart rate target was 20 beats/min above baseline heart rate. A follow-up echocardiogram was obtained one month later. N- 13 ammonia and F- 18 FDG positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging were performed 6 2 days after AMI, before coronary angiography. Mean duration of <b>arbutamine</b> infusion was 6 2 min. There was no complication {{and there were no}} major side effects. Myocardial viability was identified with PET in 15 of the 17 patients. Contractile reserve was observed in 10 patients during <b>arbutamine</b> infusion. Functional recovery was identified in 12 patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET and <b>arbutamine</b> echocardiography for predicting functional recovery were 100 %, 40 %, 76 % and 67 %, 80 %, 84 %, respectively. Conclusions - Low-dose <b>arbutamine</b> stress testing is safe early after AMI. Contractile reserve can be rapidly identified by echo cardiography and is specific, but moderately sensitive for predicting reversible dysfunction. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This study {{compared}} {{exercise and}} pharmacologic stress testing using <b>arbutamine</b> delivered by a closed-loop device {{for the detection}} of coronary artery disease. Background. <b>Arbutamine,</b> an agent designed to simulate exercise, has been developed in conjunction with a closed-loop delivery device that modulates the rate of administration on the basis of physiologic feedback. Methods. Two hundred ten patients (180 men, 30 women) with symptoms and angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease were studied. Ischemia was categorized in three ways: 1) the presence of angina; 2) the occurrence of ≥ 0. 1 -mV horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression or elevation at 60 ms after the J point; or 3) the presence of either condition 1 or 2. Results. In the 210 patients, the mean increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure evoked by <b>arbutamine</b> and exercise was 51 and 53 beats/min (p = NS) and 36 and 44 mm Hg (p < 0. 0001), respectively. <b>Arbutamine</b> detected ischemia more often than exercise with each of the three ischemic end points. Sensitivity for detecting ischemia by either angina or ST segment change was 84 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 79 % to 89 %) for <b>arbutamine</b> and 75 % (95 % CI 69 % to 81 %) for exercise testing (p = 0. 014). For angina alone, sensitivity was 73 % (95 % CI 67 % to 79 %) for <b>arbutamine</b> and 64 % (95 % CI 57 % to 71 %) for exercise (p = 0. 026). For ST segment change alone, sensitivity was 47 % (95 % CI 40 % to 54 %) for <b>arbutamine</b> and 44 % (95 % CI 37 % to 51 %) for exercise (p = 0. 426). Cardiac events occurred in five patients (1. 8 %) within 24 h of the <b>arbutamine</b> test. Conclusions. In detecting documented coronary artery disease, the sensitivity of <b>arbutamine</b> testing was equal to that of exercise for the electrocardiographic end point of ST segment change alone. <b>Arbutamine</b> testing was significantly superior to exercise testing for either ST change or angina or for angina alone...|$|E
40|$|Having {{previously}} {{shown that}} dobutamine reduces 99 mTc-me-thoxyisobutylisonitrile (sestamibi [MIBI]) uptake in normal myo-cardium by elevating intracellular calcium, {{we hypothesized that}} <b>arbutamine,</b> which has less inotropic effect than dobutamine, might cause less reduction in MIBI uptake, thereby improving defect contrast.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to determine the mechanisms for catecholamine-induced wall motion abnormalities and to compare the diagnostic efficacy of two catecholamines: <b>arbutamine</b> and dobutamine. Background. Catecholamine stress echocardiography is used to induce regional wall motion abnormalities {{for the detection of}} coronary artery disease, but the mechanism by which these abnormalities occur is unknown. Methods. Ten pigs were instrumented with left circumflex coronary artery ameroid constrictors, sonomicrometers to measure transmural wall thickening in the left circumflex (ischemic) and left anterior descending (control) coronary artery beds and a pressure gauge to measure left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt). Myocardial blood flow was measured by microspheres. Results. At 38 ± 6 days (mean ± SEM) after surgery, percent wall thickening was normal at rest in both beds but abnormal in the left circumflex coronary artery bed during atrial pacing. These findings were associated with reduced myocardial blood flow in the ischemic bed during atrial pacing. Dobutamine infusion increased percent wall thickening, with no differences between the two beds (p = 0. 63). In contrast, <b>arbutamine</b> infusion increased percent wall thickening only in the nonischemic bed, with no effect on percent wall thickening in the ischemic bed (p s 0. 03). Although the endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio tended to be reduced in the left circumflex artery bed during catecholamine infusion (p = 0. 07), both agents were similar in this effect. Despite differences in function between the beds, {{there was no difference in}} transmural myocardial blood flow between the two beds during catecholamine infusion. When examined at matched metabolic demands, <b>arbutamine</b> elicited greater differences in percent wall thickening than dobutamine between the two beds (p < 0. 01). Conclusions. <b>Arbutamine</b> was able to provoke regional differences in fonction in a manner superior to dobutamine. This occurred independently of altered transmural myocardial blood flow or differences in hemodynamic effects between the agents. Differences in their inotropic properties may be important in explaining their different effects on ischemic myocardium...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arbutamine</b> (ARB). a new β-agonist {{developed}} as a pharmacologic stress agent, was compared with treadmill exercise testing (Ex) in a multicenter study using thallium- 201 (TI) SPECT A total of 75 patients (pts) performed both forms of stress. Of the 73 pts having quantitative angiography, 68 (93 %) had coronary artery disease (≥ 50 % stenosis). TI scans were obtained in 68 pts and were scored by a central laboratory using a twenty segment (seg) /scan visual analysis (5 point system: 0 =normal, 4 =absent uptake; segmental score≥ 2 =defect). Stress TI segs with defects were further classified as reversible (rev) or nonreversible (nonrev). Hemodynamic response was summarized for 75 pts. Maximum heart rate (HR) by ARB and Ex was 122 vs 141 bpm, respectively (p< 0. 05); mean %HR change from baseline was similar (79 % vs 82 %, respectively). Maximum systolic BP for ARB and Ex was 173 vs 176 mmHg, respectively and mean %change from baseline was 31 % vs 26 %, respectively (p=NS for both). In the 68 pts with angiographic CAD, sensitivity for detecting CAD by ARB TI was 94 % and 97 % by Ex TI-SPECT (p=NS). Stress TI-SPECT segmental agreement for {{presence or absence of}} defect between ARB and Ex in 1360 segs (68 pts) was 94 % (k= 0. 7). Of 76 discordant segs, 38 (50 %) were normal by ARB and abnormal by Ex. Exact segmental stress TI score (0 – 4) agreement was 85 % (k= 0. 7). Of the 199 segs with discordant scores, the ARB-TI score was higher in 98 (49 %), Among 346 segs with stress defects by both ARB and Ex, defect rev agreement was 86 % (k= 0. 7). Of the 50 discordant segs, 25 (50 %) were rev by ARB and nonrev by Ex. Adverse events were mostly mild. Sustained arrhythmias were not observed; 3 pts had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with ARB and 1 with Ex. ConclusionIn this patient population, <b>arbutamine</b> and treadmill exercise produced a similar degree of hemodynamic response compared to baseline. The two forms of stress yielded similar diagnostic accuracy and high agreement for the presence, extent, severity and reversibility of stress myocardial perfusion abnormalities...|$|E
