5|$|The {{sandstone}} schoolhouse in {{the churchyard}} {{was built in}} 1628; the school room {{was on the ground}} floor and the schoolmaster's accommodation was above. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> was added to the rear in 1817, and in 1908 the building was restored and presented to the parish by LordStanley. It is now used as a parish hall and is listed GradeII*.|$|E
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E

5000|$|In 1844, the Egyptian Saloon was the <b>largest</b> meeting <b>room</b> in Baltimore {{and as such}} it {{was chosen}} to be the venue of that year's Democratic {{national}} convention. The room was a poor choice for the convention, as it {{was too small to}} comfortably fit all of the delegates, politicians, and spectators. As a result, the crowd spilled out onto the street. Furthermore, its acoustics were poor and the spectator gallery was described as being [...] "as black as the hole of Calcutta". During the convention, one delegate moved that the convention to be moved to <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>room</b> in Baltimore, however, the organizing committee responded that there was not <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>room</b> in the city.|$|R

5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Located {{near the}} retablo is <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> called the ante-sacristy, a storage room for church {{utensils}} and decorations. This room {{is connected to}} either the convent or the main sacristy which stores the church's liturgical vestments. Several wooden chests inside the sacristy carries the flaming heart, {{a symbol of the}} Augustinian order and okir motifs. The doors leading to both the ante-sacristy and sacristy is similar to the doors of another Jesuit church, the Maragondon Church. The sacristy was also built at that same time with the baptistry in 1852.|$|E
5|$|Opening onto Rue Saint-Honoré {{with a large}} portal, {{the south}} wing was the hotel's main building; like the east wing, it is well-preserved.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Proponents of a {{geometric}} module {{claim that}} human adults accomplish spatial reorientation in a fun-damentally {{different way than}} young children and non-human animals do. However, reporting two experiments that used a conflict paradigm, this article shows striking similarities between human adults and young children, as well as nonhuman animals. Specifically, Experiment 1 demonstrates that adults favor geometric information {{in a small room}} and rely on features in <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>room,</b> whereas Experiment 2 demonstrates that experience in <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>room</b> produces dominance of features over geometric cues in a small room—the first human case of reliance on fea-tures that contradict geometric information. Thus, use of features during reorientation depends {{on the size of the}} environment and learning history. These results clearl...|$|R
5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although it might have just been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room,</b> and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} shows <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the}} reign of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
50|$|The inglenook {{originated}} as {{a partially}} enclosed hearth area, appended to <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>room.</b> The hearth {{was used for}} cooking, and its enclosing alcove became a natural place for people seeking warmth to gather. With changes in building design, kitchens became separate rooms, while inglenooks were retained in the living space as intimate warming places, subsidiary spaces within <b>larger</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

50|$|The first {{library in}} Medford was a reading room in Temperance Hall, opened in 1903 and {{operated}} by the {{local chapter of the}} Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Medford Women's Club.

5|$|Under {{articles}} XXII and XXIII of the Act of Union of 1707, Scottish peers {{were entitled}} to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish peers to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> decorated by eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet's portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus Mór to Charles II. The Lord Clerk Register would read out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re–read, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return {{being sent to the}} clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose.|$|E
5|$|The librarians {{sought a}} larger and more centrally-located space than the Briarcliff Farms building. On March 18, 1930, after {{invitation}} from the Briarcliff school district's Board of Education, the library was relocated again. It moved to <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>room</b> {{on the main floor}} of Briarcliff High School's extension to its Law Park school building. In August 1949, the school required more classroom space, so the Board of Education asked the library to relocate. The village board then provided the library with two rooms {{on the second floor of}} its recreation building near the village downtown on Old Route 100 (then part of NY Route 100). From the beginning, the recreation center rooms were too small to hold the library's collection (only holding about 7,000 of its 8,500 books), had insufficient room for tables and chairs, and no space for exhibits or displays. As well, the area was busy with traffic, due to its location at the intersection of two highways. It was also far from the village's public school buildings and had no sidewalks nearby, making it poorly-accessible and hazardous for children to visit.|$|E
