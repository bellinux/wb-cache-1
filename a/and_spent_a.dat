5|$|The casting of {{low-profile}} actors aided {{in keeping}} the production budget low by avoiding the larger salaries attached to stars.

5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the Antarctic circle.

He returned to baseball in 1957 <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> season with the Birmingham Barons, and partway through the 1958 season, he joined the Panama City Fliers as manager. He was fired a month later, and in protest the Fliers refused to play their next game. Tipton retired afterwards, and a year later was banned for life from the minor leagues after it came to light that he accepted payouts by acting as a liaison for Jesse Levan, who was intentionally fouling off balls in order for gamblers in the stands to take advantage of them.|$|E

An unsuccessful attack on German-occupied ports on the Arctic Ocean interrupted the ferry missions in mid-1941. Furious was given a lengthy refit in the United States <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> few months training after her return in April 1942. She made several more ferry trips in mid-1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in Vichy French Algeria {{as part of the}} opening stages of Operation Torch in November 1942. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous Australian art {{arose in}} western desert {{communities}} when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Soon afterwards they established Papunya Tula, a company owned {{and controlled by}} the artists, which went on to be Australia's pre-eminent Indigenous art centre. Turkey Tolson {{was one of the}} first to paint – his name appears in the company's records in 1973; he was also one of the youngest. He was influential within the Papunya Tula movement <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> period as the longest-serving chairman of the company. In addition to painting, Turkey Tolson also made prints, with an example held in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, his cocaine {{addiction}} intensified. Jennings {{claimed to have}} spent $1,500 a day on his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased {{a home in the}} Phoenix area, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit cocaine. Jennings claimed that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to quit permanently.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal of time}} in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|Hickenbottom {{was born}} on July 22, 1965 in Chandler, Arizona. The last of four {{children}} – Randy, Scott, and Shari are his older siblings – {{he was raised in}} a military family <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> brief part of his early years in Reading, Berkshire, England, but grew up in San Antonio, Texas.

5|$|Hogg had {{previously}} suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression. She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, {{a specialist in}} the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for more than a year, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of time}} in Eastern Europe. There is {{this amazing}} German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|In 1780 the Priestleys {{moved to}} Birmingham <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> happy decade {{surrounded}} by old friends, {{until they were}} forced to flee in 1791 by religiously motivated mob violence in {{what became known as the}} Priestley Riots. Priestley accepted the ministerial position at New Meeting on the condition that he be required to preach and teach only on Sundays, so that he would have time for his writing and scientific experiments. As in Leeds, Priestley established classes for the youth of his parish and by 1781, he was teaching 150 students. Because Priestley's New Meeting salary was only 100 guineas, friends and patrons donated money and goods to help continue his investigations. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.|$|E
50|$|In 1877 he {{represented}} Surrey <b>and</b> later <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> {{year with the}} Wanderers.|$|R
60|$|And {{she was as}} good as her word, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> hour in her {{pleasant}} embroidery of {{the pretty}} white letters of the name which she really delighted in doing, only she would have liked a fresh pattern instead of making all the seventy-two Ninas exactly alike.|$|R

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts. One of them {{included}} the first complete performance of his First Symphony, subtitled Winter Daydreams, in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony in its revised version. Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time together, along with Glazunov and Lyadov. Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home since 1876, and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky-Korsakov's appointment {{as director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, this was the beginning of closer relations between the two. Within a couple of years, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, Tchaikovsky's visits became more frequent.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Jenner {{developed}} Parkinson's {{disease and}} therefore retired from IBM. With money that Jessie had inherited, the couple moved to Bexley in 1953, where they began attending Bexley Gospel Hall. Towards {{the end of}} his life, Jenner developed dementia and his narcolepsy worsened. For six months, he was confined to a bed and was treated with amphetamine. He was then diagnosed with colorectal cancer <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> subsequent ten days at Calvary Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, where he died at 11:45pm on 8 May 1977 at the age of 73. Because he had befriended so many police officers towards {{the end of his}} life, his body was given a police escort to the burial, which took place at Woronora Lawn Cemetery. His wife died two years later.|$|E
60|$|The day {{proved an}} ideal one, {{but the wind}} was light and the yacht {{scarcely}} moved even with the mainsail and jib set to their fullest. This being so, the boys got out their fishing lines <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> hour in trolling, and succeeded in catching several fair-sized fish.|$|R
60|$|The {{first day}} she spent in looking about the farm with John. Towards evening she climbed the hills alone, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> {{hour on the}} {{familiar}} slope. It helped her to look down on her plans and her daily life, {{and the next day}} she met the question direct.|$|R
60|$|On {{that night}} Ontario walked {{all the way}} out to Alexandria Cottage, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> hour leaning upon the gate, looking up at the window of the breeches-maker's bedroom;--for the chamber of Polly herself opened backwards. When he had stood there an hour, he walked home to Bond Street.|$|R
