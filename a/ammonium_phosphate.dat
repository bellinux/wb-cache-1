5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
25|$|Cats on a {{vegan diet}} can develop {{abnormally}} alkaline (high pH) urine {{due to the}} more alkaline pH of plant-based proteins {{in comparison to the}} acidic pH of meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine pH becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of struvite (also known as magnesium <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphate)</b> bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur, but these do not occur if the urine is too alkaline, but rather if it is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{infected}} with L. brevis, L. hilgardii, and L. fermentum {{have been known}} to occasionally develop an aroma reminiscent of rodent droppings. The aroma becomes more pronounced when the wine is rubbed between the fingers and, if consumed, can leave a long, unpleasant finish. The aroma can be very potent, detectable at a sensory threshold as low as 1.6 parts per billion (µg/l). The exact compound behind this is derivatives of the amino acid lysine created through an oxidation reaction with ethanol. While undesirable LAB species have been most commonly associated with this fault, wine infected by Brettanomyces yeast in the presence of <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and lysine have also been known to exhibit this fault.|$|E

Both <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> uptake were slightly influenced coexisting ions commonly found in treated wastewater effluents. The Mn(II) activated zeolite (Z-Mn) improved the phosphate uptake capacity, in the pH range 7 to 9, by formation of surface complexes of P(V) anions with the precipitated Mn(II) hydrated oxide or by formation of mineral phases as Mn(II) [...] NH 4 -PO 4 (e. g., (NH 4 MnPO 4 ·H 2 O)) which was detected by XRD analysis.

World production in 2004 was about 180 million tonnes, with the following geographic distribution: Asia 35%, North America (including Mexico) 24%, Africa 11%, Western Europe 10%, Eastern Europe and Russia 10%, Australia and Oceania 7%, South America 7%. Most of this amount (≈60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment. About 6% of uses are related to pigments and include paints, enamels, printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, and the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as production of explosives, cellophane, acetate and viscose textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals and batteries.|$|E

In this paper we studied the possibilities of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> removal from waters through precipitation using the Jar-Test method.

Reversible phosphate ion coordination to the metal complex binding sites decreases the emission intensity of the phthalic ester fluorophore. Structurally suitable <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> such as the Cterminal domain of RNA polymerase II or the protein kinase G target sequence, bind to the synthetic receptors by an additional intramolecular interaction between the ammonium ion and the aza crown ether. The binding of the ammonium ion to the aza crown ether increases the emission intensity of the fluorophore. In aqueous solution, this weak interaction can only occur within aggregates of phosphates and metal complex receptors of matching geometry;therefore, it allows the distinction of structurally related phosphorylated peptides in buffered aqueous solution. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> uptake by {{leaves and}} {{roots of the}} tropical seagrass Thalassia hemprichii were investigated in laboratory experiments. Uptake in leaves of plants from 3 different locations, covering the range from coastal to oceanic conditions {{in the region of}} investigation (Spermonde Archipelago, South Sulawesi, Indonesia), was compared. The leaves from all plant samples showed a clear capacity for both <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> uptake. This uptake could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. v(max) ranged between 32 and 37 mu mol g(- 1) leaf dry weight h(- 1) for ammonium and between 2. 2 and 3. 2 mu mol g(- 1) leaf dry weight h(- 1) for phosphate. K-m ranged between 21 and 60 mu M for ammonium and between 7. 7 and 15 mu M for phosphate. There was no significant site difference in uptake characteristics (v(max) and K-m) of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate.</b> Uptake of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> by roots was investigated with plants from the intermediate location, Barang Lompo, using an approach which allowed only calculation of uptake rates at natural pore water concentrations. Uptake rates were 22 and 1. 0 mu mol g(- 1) root dry weight h(- 1) for <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate,</b> respectively Calculations suggest that at all 3 locations uptake of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> by roots was probably limited by the diffusion of nutrients in the sediment rather than by their uptake capacity. Evidence was found that the availability of nutrients in the root zone relative to the leaf zone affects the uptake affinity of the leaves. The role of roots versus leaves in supplying plant nutrients is discussed. We concluded that even in the tropics, where water column nutrient concentrations are often very low, leaves clearly have a significant ability for <b>ammonium</b> or <b>phosphate</b> uptake and that in some situations nutrient uptake by the leaves may even be essential in meeting plant nutrient demands.
