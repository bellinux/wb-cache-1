5|$|Sherman {{was born}} in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, near {{the banks of the}} Hocking River. His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a {{successful}} lawyer who sat on the Ohio Supreme Court, died unexpectedly in 1829. He left his widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, with eleven children and no inheritance. After his father's death, the nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing, Sr., a prominent member of the Whig Party who served as senator from Ohio and as the first Secretary of the Interior. Sherman was distantly related to American founding father Roger Sherman and grew to <b>admire</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an Ark {{in preparation for a}} flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the ark with his sons, who start to <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> as he is spending more time with them.|$|E
5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him {{how to find the}} creature that attacked him.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who <b>admire</b> <b>him.</b> Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E

25|$|Someone {{from whom}} I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> but I cannot {{understand}} why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what {{seems to me to}} have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the book brought some literary fame to Goyen, both in New York and in Texas. He would later recall that he felt that “everyone he met in the literary world wanted a piece of him, wanted to <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> as the moment’s fashion, {{and yet at the}} same time he felt that others were angry at him for his moment of public recognition.” He would also recall later that he was “just about disinherited” by his family after the book’s publication, and “fell out of favor with many people” in his home town.|$|E

That willingness to take risks with his career, and his life, {{is one reason why}} people still <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> today." [...] For music historians Urish and Bielen, Lennon's most significant effort was [...] "the self-portraits... in his songs [...] spoke to, for, and about, the human condition." ...|$|E
500|$|Gawain's {{function}}, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, [...] "is {{the function}} of the romance hero… to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action." [...] Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view {{in the midst of the}} poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain [...] "shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> for pointing out the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Adolf Hitler {{is said to}} {{have called}} her [...] "the most {{dangerous}} woman in Europe" [...] because he viewed her popularity as a threat to German interests. However, before the war both she and her husband, like most of Parliament and the British public, had supported appeasement and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked Winston Churchill to form a government. Although the King was initially suspicious of Churchill's character and motives, in due course both the King and Queen came to respect and <b>admire</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Erastus Corning 2nd, arguably Albany's {{most notable}} mayor (and {{great-grandson}} {{of the former}} mayor of the same name), was elected in 1941. Although {{he was one of the}} longest-serving mayors of any city in United States history (1942 until his death in 1983), one historian describes Corning's tenure as [...] "long on years, short on accomplishments." [...] Grondahl cited Corning's preference for maintaining the status quo as a factor that held back potential progress during his tenure. While Corning brought stability to the office of mayor, it is said even those who <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> greatly cannot come up with a sizable list of [...] "major concrete Corning achievements." [...] Corning is given credit for saving—albeit somewhat unintentionally—much of Albany's historic architecture.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{following the}} arrival of the French New Wave, career retrospectives of Clouzot's work have been positive. Twenty years after his death, film critic Noël Herpe wrote in the French film journal Positif that [...] "Les Diaboliques (just like Les Espions and La Verite) reveals a sterile and increasingly exaggerated urge to experiment with the powers of fiction". Film historian Philipe Pilard wrote, [...] "There is no doubt that if Clouzot had worked for Hollywood and applied the formulas of U.S. studios, today he would be lauded by the very critics who choose to ignore him". Clouzot today is generally known for his thriller films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique. Clouzot's ability in the genre led to comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock. Clouzot respected Hitchcock's work, stating, [...] "I <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> very much and am flattered when anyone compares a film of mine to his".|$|E
500|$|Between the Restoration of {{the monarchy}} in 1660 {{and the end of}} the 17th century, {{classical}} ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson. Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, [...] "I <b>admire</b> <b>him,</b> but I love Shakespeare". For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation. By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1941, Rommel's name {{began to appear in}} the British media. In the autumn of 1941 and early winter of 1941/1942, he was {{mentioned}} in the British press almost daily. The Daily Express and The Cairns Post wrote: [...] "No 'von' nonsense about Erich, nor the code of conduct—such as it was—that most Prussian officers have honoured in war. He is a gangster general, trained in a harder school than Chicago. He was Hitler's thug organiser before he came to power ... So Erich became leader of the S.S. Black Guard, Hitler's private army, which executes his private revenges and guards his person ... When at last Poland made a stand for democracy, it was Rommel who led a panzer corps against the Polish horse cavalry with conspicuous gallantry. Later in France Hitler made him a Knight of the Iron Cross for breaking through the Maginot Line at Maubeuge with the 7th Armoured Division. True, French resistance was almost at an end then, but Erich was entitled to his decoration, too." [...] Toward the end of the year, the Reich propaganda machine also used Rommel's successes in Africa as a diversion from the Wehrmacht's challenging situation in the Soviet Union with the stall of Operation Barbarossa. The American press soon began to take notice of Rommel as well, following the United States' entry into the war on 11 December 1941, writing that: [...] "The British ... <b>admire</b> <b>him</b> because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general". General Claude Auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel the notion that Rommel was a [...] "superman". The Tunisian tug-of-war and the Battle of Kasserine Pass intensified the GIs' admiration towards Rommel. The cult of personality was so strong that, according to Peter Schrijvers, [...] "for the remainder of the war, German POWs would part with pictures of Rommel as reluctantly as GIs were eager to get them". While Allied troops respected Rommel, civilians held the [...] "widely accepted" [...] negative image of Rommel's origin and his connection with the Nazis. As described by Rosie Goldschmidt Waldeck (who debunked the invented story) and The New York Times in 1943, [...] "It has been said that Rommel started his career as a Hitler hoodlum and owes his quick rise to his early collaboration with Himmler." [...] This line of propaganda perpetuated until the war ended.|$|E
