40|$|The {{test results}} of a {{breadboard}} version of an <b>ac</b> electric-vehicle <b>propulsion</b> subsystem are presented. The breadboard was installed in the NASA Lewis Research Center Road Load Simulator facility and tested under steady-state and transient conditions. Steady-state tests were run to characterize the system and component efficiencies over the complete speed-torque range within the capability of the propulsion subsystem in the motoring mode of operation. Transient tests were performed to determine the energy consumption of the breadboard over the acceleration and cruise portions of SAE J 227 and driving schedules B, C, and D. Tests in the regenerative mode were limited to the low-gear-speed range of the two speed transaxle used in the subsystem. The maximum steady-state subsystem efficiency observed for the breadboard was 81. 5 percent in the high-gear-speed range in the motoring mode, and 76 percent in the regenerative braking mode (low gear). The subsystem energy efficiency during the transient tests ranged from 49. 2 percent for schedule B to 68. 4 percent for Schedule D...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- A {{prototype}} Integrated Power System that {{is representative}} of advanced power systems of future warships is considered. This system is comprised of an <b>AC</b> Generation and <b>Propulsion</b> System {{as well as a}} DC Zonal Electrical Distribution System. Obtaining accurate average-value models of individual subsystems {{that can be used for}} extracting the input/output impedance as well as for increasing the simulation speed of the respective models. In this paper, a parametric approach for developing a dynamic average-value model of a generator-rectifier subsystem is presented. The method initially requires a detailed switched model from which the rectifier/dc-link dynamics are captured using numerical averaging; however, the resulting model is continuous and computationally efficient. The developed average-value model is compared against measured and detailed simulation results and is shown to be very accurate in both the time- and frequency-domains. A 74 -fold increase in simulation speed is achieved. Key-Words:- naval electric systems, synchronous generator, average value model, impedance, simulation. ...|$|R
25|$|Otso was {{the first}} {{icebreaker}} {{in the world to}} utilize cycloconverters and alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>propulsion</b> motors. Although electrical propulsion had already been used in Finnish icebreakers for almost five decades due to its flexibility and good torque characteristics at low propeller speeds, the older vessels had direct current (DC) propulsion motors which were very heavy and bulky at such power levels. Although it would have been possible to use two smaller DC motors in tandem, recent advances in drive and control technology as well as excellent experiences from a prototype installation on board the Finnish research vessel Aranda were in favor of the new type of propulsion system. As a result, Otso was fitted with two Kymi-Strömberg synchronous AC motors rated at 7,500kW. The maximum power is available at propeller speeds ranging from 115 to 220rpm to both directions and at lower speeds the propulsion motors are capable of providing 130% of the rated torque to prevent the four-bladed stainless steel propellers from jamming in severe ice conditions. The bollard pull of Otso is 160tons.|$|E

500|$|The 1000-Series entered {{service in}} 1976 when the Metro system opened, and were {{refurbished}} and had their motors converted from DC to <b>AC</b> <b>propulsion</b> by Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie in the mid-1990s. In 2006, the NTSB cited the 1000-Series cars as [...] "vulnerable to catastrophic telescoping damage and complete loss of occupant survival {{space in a}} longitudinal end-structure collision". It recommended refurbishment of the entire series after a 2004 collision at the Woodley Park station in which a 1000-Series Rohr car telescoped into another train. In this case, NTSB's Hersman confirmed that, [...] "the first car [...] overrode the rear car , {{and much of the}} survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised". The NTSB called for the accelerated retirement of the 1000-Series cars, or urged that they be [...] "retrofitted with crashworthiness collision protection that is comparable to 6000-Series car railcars." [...] Additionally, the 1000-Series cars lack data recorders {{that could be used in}} determining the cause of a crash. During the press conference, Catoe stated that he had [...] "no basis to suspend the use of 1000-Series cars at this time". However, WMATA later announced a decision to no longer use the 1000-Series cars as the lead or trailing units of any trains.|$|E
40|$|This work reports {{theoretical}} {{studies and}} experimental proofs of the propulsion of mini-/micro-scale floating objects that propel on air-liquid interface by using two different principles. The devices are extremely simple {{and do not}} include any moving parts. The first principle takes advantage of three-phase contact line oscillation that is activated by AC electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) to propel the floating object. The capillary wave that is generated by the free surface oscillation is visualized by using the Free-Surface Synthetic Schlieren (FS-SS) method. A 3 -D flow field sketch is constructed based on the flow visualizations and PIV measurements. The flow field and trajectories of seeded particles suggest that Stokes drift is the responsible mechanism for the propulsion. The propulsion speed of the floating object highly depends on the amplitude, frequency, {{and shape of the}} EWOD signal. These phenomena are also explained by the measured oscillation amplitudes and Stokes drift relations. Additionally, it is shown that a wider EWOD electrode generates a faster propelling speed. Finally, with stacked planar receiver coils and an amplitude modulated signal, a wirelessly powered <b>AC</b> EWOD <b>propulsion</b> is realized. The second principle of floating object propulsion is the Cheerios effect, which is also generally known as lateral capillary force. Four common physical configurations (interactions between two infinite vertical walls, two vertical circular cylinders, two spheres, and a sphere and a vertical wall) are reviewed. Through theoretical analysis, it has been revealed that not the wettability of the surface but the slope angle of the object is the most important parameter for the Cheerios effect. A general rule for this effect is that the lateral capillary force is attractive if the slope angles of the interacting objects have the same sign, otherwise the force is repulsive. In addition to the surface wettability, the size and the density of floating spheres are also important for the slope angle. Active control of the Cheerios effect is achieved by implementing EWOD and dielectrowetting methods to adjust the surface wettability. By sequentially activating micro-fabricated EWOD/dielectrowetting electrodes, linear translations of floating objects in the small scale channel are accomplished. A continuous rotational motion of the floating rod is achieved in a circular container by the EWOD method...|$|R
40|$|Electric and hybrid-electric vehicle systems {{require an}} {{inverter}} {{to convert the}} direct current (DC) output of the energy generation/storage system (engine, fuel cells, or batteries) to the alternating current (<b>AC)</b> that vehicle <b>propulsion</b> motors use. Vehicle support systems, such as lights and air conditioning, also use the inverter AC output. Distributed energy systems require an inverter to provide the high quality AC output that energy system customers demand. Today's inverters are expensive due {{to the cost of}} the power electronics components, and system designers must also tailor the inverter for individual applications. Thus, the benefits of mass production are not available, resulting in high initial procurement costs as well as high inverter maintenance and repair costs. Electricore, Inc. (www. electricore. org) a public good 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit advanced technology development consortium assembled a highly qualified team consisting of AeroVironment Inc. (www. aerovironment. com) and Delphi Automotive Systems LLC (Delphi), (www. delphi. com), as equal tiered technical leads, to develop an advanced, modular construction, inverter packaging technology that will offer a 30 % cost reduction over conventional designs adding to the development of energy conversion technologies for crosscutting applications in the building, industry, transportation, and utility sectors. The proposed inverter allows for a reduction of weight and size of power electronics in the above-mentioned sectors and is scalable over the range of 15 to 500 kW. The main objective of this program was to optimize existing AeroVironment inverter technology to improve power density, reliability and producibility as well as develop new topology to reduce line filter size. The newly developed inverter design will be used in automotive and distribution generation applications. In {{the first part of this}} program the high-density power stages were redesigned, optimized and fabricated. One of the main tasks was to design and validate new gate drive circuits to provide the capability of high temp operation. The new power stages and controls were later validated through extensive performance, durability and environmental tests. To further validate the design, two power stages and controls were integrated into a grid-tied load bank test fixture, a real application for field-testing. This fixture was designed to test motor drives with PWM output up to 50 kW. In the second part of this program the new control topology based on sub-phases control and interphase transformer technology was successfully developed and validated. The main advantage of this technology is to reduce magnetic mass, loss and current ripple. This report summarizes the results of the advanced modular inverter technology development and details: (1) Power stage development and fabrication (2) Power stage validation testing (3) Grid-tied test fixture fabrication and initial testing (4) Interphase transformer technology developmen...|$|R

50|$|Martin Eberhard and Elon Musk {{had both}} taken test drives in the {{lithium-ion}} battery powered {{revision of the}} <b>AC</b> <b>Propulsion</b> tzero before joining Tesla Motors. Martin Eberhard encouraged Tom Gage and Alan Cocconi to move their prototype tzero into production.

50|$|The tzero is a {{handmade}} electric {{sports car}} {{designed and built}} in very limited numbers by the U.S. company <b>AC</b> <b>Propulsion.</b> The tzero {{was based on the}} Piontek Sportech kit car, which consists of a fiberglass body built over a reinforced steel space frame with double wishbone independent suspension and rack and pinion steering. <b>AC</b> <b>Propulsion</b> added the AC-150 drivetrain, a single-speed electric system with an overall gear ratio of 9:1. Launched in January 1997, only three prototypes were built and plans for commercial production were dropped in mid-2003. The name comes from t0, the mathematical symbol for a starting point in time. Due to high production costs, <b>AC</b> <b>Propulsion</b> ceased to produce the tzero. Only three were built, one of which is owned by the company itself, one by Gruber Power Services, a company that specializes in Tesla Roadster repair, and one privately. The drivetrain, however, was used in many other vehicles. Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released — slowing sharply as energy is recaptured — it can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal. Also, if the car detects a turn with more than half a g-force (5 m/s²), it eases the rear-wheel regenerative braking to prevent slides.|$|E
