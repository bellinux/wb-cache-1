5|$|In December 2016, Sony Pictures {{announced}} a sequel for Spider-Man: Homecoming, {{scheduled to be}} released on July 5, 2019. In June 2017, Feige stated that the film would be titled {{in a similar fashion}} to Homecoming, using a subtitle, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have a number in the title.|$|E

5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. It proved to be an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time away from the game. He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E

5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E
5|$|Around 956, Olaf, at Melkorka's urging, {{decided to}} go abroad to seek his fortune. Hoskuld was opposed <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> provide trade wares, and the {{property}} of Olaf's foster-father Thord was mostly in immobile goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the Feeble, a farmer who had previously assisted her {{in the management of}} Melkorkustead. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had a son named Lambi.|$|E
5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E

5|$|Backup guard Brandon Gore {{broke his}} ankle during the Hokies' loss to Florida State <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to}} participate. Senior Tech running back Mike Imoh, who shared time running the ball {{during the regular season}} with Ore and Humes, was also out after {{undergoing}} surgery to repair an injured ankle. Adding to the injury situation for Virginia Tech was offensive tackle Jimmy Martin, who suffered a sprained knee ligament in practice leading up to the game. Martin started 45consecutive games prior to the Gator Bowl, a streak that was broken when he was replaced by Brandon Frye {{on the day of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Bringing up Baby was a {{commercial}} flop upon its release, although it eventually {{made a small}} profit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film's premiere, Hepburn was infamously labeled box-office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later. The film's reputation began to grow during the 1950s, when it was shown on television.|$|E
5|$|Chapman was keen to get Northampton Town {{into the}} Football League, {{but with no}} {{automatic}} promotion or relegation rules at the time this proved very difficult. Chapman proposed a new two-division Football Alliance underneath the two divisions of the Football League, with automatic promotion and relegation (a similar system to the four-division League setup introduced in 1921), but this was rejected at the time (<b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> come about until 1920). In the 1912 close season, he was offered the chance to manage Second Division Leeds City, and with Northampton's blessing moved north again to join the League side.|$|E

Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) {{would have been}} in the middle dan ranks and held the title of 'Master' when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reported}} {{interest from}} English clubs Everton, Manchester United, Arsenal, and Spanish club Real Madrid, {{rumors of a}} move to rivals Marseille began to surface. On 28 June 2008, Lyon confirmed that a proposed transfer to Marseille had been cancelled for the time being. However, Ben Arfa confirmed to the local La Provence newspaper on 29 June that he had signed for the southern coast club <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> return to Lyon for pre-season training the following day. La Provence later reported that Ben Arfa had in fact missed training in Lyon on 30 June, confirming his intentions.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the Germans {{had been unable to}} develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For the first time the Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that the Germans did not have nuclear weapons, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have them for some time.|$|E

5|$|Drnovšek's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not run for president again led to expectations that the Social Democrats (SD) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that he was ready to run for the office. The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of mixed signals, Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E
5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be available for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 Build keynote, Microsoft {{announced}} a Universal Windows Platform bridge {{that would allow}} Android and iOS software to be ported to Windows 10 Mobile and published to the Windows Store. In August 2015, A version of the Microsoft Android bridge toolset {{was reported to be}} leaked and available on the internet along with its documentation. The leaked toolset required developers to register and use the WNS to send notification data to ported applications, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> allow for Google Cloud Messaging to be used instead. Microsoft later discontinued the Android bridge project in favor of continuing support for iOS application porting instead.|$|E
