We use a model with volatile stock markets where shareholders design compensation schemes that incentivize managers to stimulate short-term increases in stock prices that do not maximize long run stock market value. We show that D&O insurance provides a convenient instrument for the initial shareholders of a company to take advantage of differences in beliefs between insiders and outsiders in capital markets. The empirical results support the idea that both the insurance coverage and the premium are higher in the presence <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>shareholders</b> and volatile markets.

The mechanics of the model of restricted shrinkage upon the adherence <b>of</b> <b>new</b> steel fiber reinforced concrete to old concrete are described. The results demonstrate that the difference of shrinkage between the new and the old concrete can been reduced by adding steel fiber to the new concrete. The decrease of shrinkage difference reduces the shrinkage force at the adhesive interface, which improves the <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> concrete to old concrete and the magnitude of the decrease of shrinkage difference is correlated to the steel fiber volume fraction...|$|R

50|$|In 1928 {{with the}} entry <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>shareholders,</b> {{the name was}} changed and {{important}} work begins such as a new aerial cable and a plant with large dimensions in Rio (Cabeço do Pião). Production returns to values close to 30 t of concentrate per month. New production stoppage period from 1931 to 1934. At this time a tin smelting furnace was installed in Rio. In 1934 there was a <b>new</b> increase <b>of</b> the wolfram prices and consequent growth of the activity in the three main exploration areas of the concession (Panasqueira, Barroca Grande and Rio). This cycle associated with the Second World War was remarkable with 750 workers in 1934; 4,457 in 1942 and 10,540 workers in 1943. The Plant at Rio reached a capacity of 300 t per day and Panasqueira 1,000 t per day. The monthly production of concentrates reached 300 t, more {{than the rest of}} the country. It is at that time that the connection is made Underground from Barroca Grande to Panasqueira. At the time of the Second World War, Panasqueira was the largest mine in the country and one of the largest wolfram mines in the world. The price of the wolfram dropped drastically at the end of the Second World War, only increasing again in 1950 due to the Korean War. During this period there was a great modernization of the company with the introduction of scrapers and mechanical loaders. Mules were replaced by locomotives. The production of cassiterite was increased to compensate the low prices of wolfram. The production of copper concentrates began in 1962. From 1957 to 1965 there was a further decrease in the price of wolfram which resulted in a reduction of production in order to control cost. During this period the company increaed the production of tin to compensate the low wolfram prices. In 1966, there was a positive evolution that peaked in 1970 and this corresponded to a period of expansion. However, soon afterwards prices suddenly dropped again. During this period the production was stockpiled instead of selling below the production price, but due to the financial expenses it was decided to increase the capital with the entry <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>Shareholders.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} identity <b>of</b> <b>new</b> controlling <b>shareholders</b> in partial corporate control transactions {{and its influence}} on firm performance and corporate policies in an international context. In a transfer of partial corporate control, the identity of controlling shareholder changs, thereby facilitating an event study of corporate changes resulted from controlling shareholder turnover. The dissertation comprises of three empirical research projects to address two questions: Firstly, does the identity <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> controlling <b>shareholder</b> in a partial control transfer matter to firm value? Secondly, how does <b>new</b> controlling <b>shareholder</b> identity explain the differences of firm performance and corporate policies in the long run? The equity block transactions in listed firms {{from around the world}} announced between 1996 and 2005 are filtered to arrive at the final sample of 215 corporate control transfers through private negotiation. This hand-collected dataset allows the dissertation to contribute to the existing literature on ownership concentration by introducing the identity of controlling shareholder into the theoretical framework and investigating its significance in an international context. It is argued that firm value, long-term performance and corporate policies can be influenced by the identity <b>of</b> <b>new</b> controlling <b>shareholders</b> because different controlling shareholders have distinct incentives, skills and styles. This dissertation finds that individual investor controlled firms outperform those controlled by corporate investors in both short-term abnormal returns and long-term performance after a control transfer; and that the sample firms controlled by individual and corporate investors adopt different policies of investment and financial leverage. The evidence presented here shows that individual controlling shareholders are better motivated to monitor managers and improve operational efficiency. Partial corporate control activities have important governance effects and controlling shareholder heterogeneity is a significant contributing factor to firm performance and decision making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of pre-IPO {{ownership}} structure on the proportion, allocation, and pricing <b>of</b> <b>new</b> issued shares, {{as well as the}} costs of going public. We find that retaining control is an important consideration for pre-IPO owners/managers. Where the pre-IPO ownership of managers indicates their highest sensitivity to control dilution, the firm issues the least shares and the new shares are not allocated in favor <b>of</b> <b>new</b> large <b>shareholders.</b> We also find that larger pre-IPO shareholdings create an incentive for managers to reduce the total cost of the issue. These results highlight the significance of recognizing that prior to going public, private firms are not always wholly owned by managers. Low pre-IPO ownership concentration can therefore result in agency problems that affect key decisions in the IPO process...|$|R

50|$|In this process, a wire (or {{bundle of}} wires) is {{preheated}} to above the glass transition or melting {{temperature of the}} polymer coating {{that is to be}} applied. This is to ensure <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> coating. Next, this preheated bare wire is pulled very rapidly through a die which places a thin coating of polymer around the wire. Due to the geometry of the dies used, relatively high extrusion rates are possible while still avoiding melt fracture. The newly coated wire is then drawn through an air or gas flame to smooth the surface of the coating, and finally a water bath to fully cool the coated wire. Coated wires are now spooled to prepare for further processing, if desired.|$|R
6000|$|If {{the great}} {{material}} {{developments of the}} nineteenth century had been final, if they had, indeed, constituted merely a revolution and not an absolute release from the fixed conditions about which human affairs circled, we might even now be settling accounts with our Merovingians as the socialists desire. But these developments were not final, and one sees no hint as yet of any coming finality. Invention runs free and our state is under its dominion. The novel is continually struggling to establish itself at the relative or absolute expense of the old. The statesman's conception of social organization is no longer stability but growth. And so long as material progress continues, this tribute must continue to be paid; so long as the stream of development flows, this necessary back eddy will endure. Even if we [...] "municipalize" [...] all sorts of undertakings we shall not alter the essential facts, we shall only substitute for the shareholder the corporation stockholder. The figure of an eddy is particularly appropriate. Enterprises will come and go, the relative values of kinds of wealth will alter, old appliances, old companies, will serve their time and fall in value, individuals will waste their substance, individual families and groups will die out, certain portions of the share property of the world may be gathered, by elaborate manipulation, into a more or less limited number of hands, conceivably even families and groups will be taxed out by graduated legacy duties and specially apportioned income taxes, but, for all such possible changes and modifications, the shareholding element will still endure, so long as our present progressive and experimental state of society obtains. And the very diversity, laxity, and weakness of the general shareholding element, which will work to prevent its organizing itself in the interests of its property, or of evolving any distinctive traditions or positive characters, will obviously prevent its obstructing the continual appearance <b>of</b> <b>new</b> enterprises, <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>shareholders</b> to replace the loss of its older constituents....|$|R
40|$|EQUITY ISSUANCE AND RETURNS TO DISTRESSED FIRMS This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} {{positive relationship between}} financial distress and equity issuance and shows that dilution explains the low stock returns of distressed firms. When the cross-section of firms is sorted by degree of distress, the value-weighted mean of the monthly net issuance rate increases significantly from 0. 05 % for the safest decile portfolio to 0. 95 % for the highest. Moreover, the low returns of distressed firms are found only in past net issuers. The primary source of distressed equity issuances is discounted private issuances. Unlike earlier empirical studies that focus on returns to existing shareholders, I find that firms that issue equity privately do not underperform when returns <b>of</b> existing and <b>new</b> <b>shareholders</b> are combined. I also show that many managers avoid shareholder approval when issuing discounted equity by keeping the fraction <b>of</b> <b>new</b> shares just below the required 20 % approval threshold.

S 8 rensen's positive evaluation appears as reasonable for a closed economy where the deduction for the imputed return is capitalized into the market prices of corporate shares.
