5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent <b>analysis,</b> <b>using</b> the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E

5|$|Other species {{names such}} as Cicuta bolanderi, Cicuta californica, and Cicuta curtissii are older names now {{recognized}} to be varieties of the widespread, morphologically variable Cicuta maculata. Cicuta maculata is now recognized to have four varieties: var. maculata, var. augustifolia, var. victorinii, and var. bolanderi. Phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>using</b> the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that C.bulbifera and C.virosa are monophyletic, while C.douglasii may not be. It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species. Other common names for the genus in general include poison parsnip, beaver poison, wild carrot, wild parsnip, and false parsley.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, Limousin breeders {{have worked}} {{extensively}} on improving disposition issues in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Significant improvement has been recorded in the temperament of Limousins, as can be observed from trait trends published by various international breed associations.|$|E
5|$|Pacific {{populations of}} the false {{catshark}} were once regarded as a separate species, P. acrales. However, morphological comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between P. microdon and P. acrales, leading {{to the conclusion that}} there is only one species of false catshark. The closest relatives of the false catshark are the gollumsharks (Gollum). Pseudotriakis and Gollum share a number of morphological similarities. Phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>using</b> protein-coding genes has found that the amount of genetic divergence between these taxa is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many autapomorphies (unique traits) of the false catshark evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of Pseudotriakis and Gollum together in the family Pseudotriakidae.|$|E
