25|$|Malaria is {{the deadliest}} among {{infectious}} diseases, accounting for approximately 429,000 human deaths in 2015 {{as of the}} latest estimate by the World Health Organization. In humans, malaria {{can be caused by}} five Plasmodium parasites, namely P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. P. falciparum is the most dangerous species, attributed to >99% of malaria's death toll, with 70% of these deaths occurring in {{children under the age of}} five years. The parasites are transmitted through the bites of female mosquitos (of the species of Anopheles). Before invading the RBCs and causing the symptoms of malaria, the parasites first multiply in the liver. The daughter parasites called merozoites then only infect the RBCs. They undergo structural development inside the RBCs, becoming trophozoites and schizonts. It is during this period that malarial symptoms are produced. Unlike RBCs infected by other Plasmodium species, P. falciparum-infected RBCs had been known to spontaneously stick together. By the early 1980s, it was established that when the parasite (both the trophozoite and schizont forms) enters the blood stream and infects RBCs, the infected cells form knobs on their surface. Then they become sticky, and get attached to the walls (endothelium) of the blood vessels through a process called cytoadhesion, or cytoadherence. Such attachment favours binding with and accumulation of other RBCs. This process is known as sequestration. It is during this condition that the parasites induce an immune response (<b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction)</b> and evade destruction in the spleen. Although the process and significance of sequestration were described in detail by two Italian physicians Amico Bignami and Ettore Marchiafava in the early 1890s, it took a century to discover the actual factor for the stickiness and virulence.|$|E

50|$|Antigen-antibody interaction, or <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction,</b> is a {{specific}} chemical interaction between antibodies produced by B cells of the white blood cells and antigens during immune reaction. It is the fundamental reaction in the body by which the body is protected from complex foreign molecules, such as pathogens and their chemical toxins. In the blood, the antigens are specifically and with high affinity bound by antibodies to form an antigen-antibody complex. The immune complex is then transported to cellular systems {{where it can be}} destroyed or deactivated.|$|E
50|$|An immune complex, {{sometimes}} called an antigen-antibody complex, is a molecule formed from the integral binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen. The bound antigen and antibody {{act as a}} unitary object, effectively an antigen of its own with a specific epitope. After an <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction,</b> the immune complexes can be subject to any {{of a number of}} responses, including complement deposition, opsonization, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Red blood cells carrying CR1-receptors on their surface may bind C3b-coated immune complexes and transport them to phagocytes, mostly in liver and spleen, and return to the general circulation.|$|E
50|$|For the {{detection}} of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37 Â°C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction</b> occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, {{but there is no}} enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.|$|E

5000|$|A {{hemolytic}} state exists {{whenever the}} red cell survival time is shortened {{from the normal}} average of 120 days. Hemolytic anemia is the hemolytic state in which anemia is present, and bone marrow function is inferentially unable {{to compensate for the}} shortened life-span of the red cell. Immune hemolytic states are those, both anemic and nonanemic, which involve immune mechanisms consisting of antigen-antibody reactions. These reactions may result from unrelated antigen-antibody complexes that fix to an innocent-bystander erythrocyte, or from related antigen-antibody combinations in which the host red cell or some part of its structure is or has become antigenic. The latter type of <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction</b> may be termed [...] "autoimmune", and hemolytic anemias so produced are autoimmune hemolytic anemias.|$|E

40|$|An <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction</b> {{occurring}} in the perfused sensitized guinea pig lung, has been demonstrated to release kallikrein, a proteolytic enzyme related {{to the formation of}} kinins. This lung kallikrein is similar to plasma kallikrein in all properties studied, including susceptibility to the same inhibitors, electrophoretic mobility, and heterogeneity in molecular size. The release of kallikrein during anaphylaxis in the guinea pig lung occurs in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Perfusion of ellagic acid into nonsensitized lungs will also release kallikrein, presumably through activation of Hageman factor. On the basis of these findings the hypothesis is suggested that the kallikrein in perfused lung activated by the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reaction</b> is, in fact, plasma kallikrein.

40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} (EIA) {{consists of a}} series of <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reactions</b> which result in the binding of an enzyme-labeled antibody to a solid phase. The performance time of an EIA determination is thus largely dependent upon the time required for the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>reactions.</b> In an attempt to develop a rapid EIA system, we investigated the time course of an EIA system for the measurement of Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide. We found that, although the use of short incubations led to a decrease in sensitivity, an assay system utilizing 10 -min incubation periods was still capable of detecting antigen at a concentration of 1 ng/ml. Important factors in the sensitivity of EIAs with short incubation times were the performance of the reaction at 37 degrees C and the incubation of the solid phase with constant agitation. Utilizing these techniques, we developed an EIA system for the measurement of H. influenzae type b polysaccharide which could be completed in less than 30 min. This system was sufficiently sensitive to detect H. influenzae polysaccharide in the cerebrospinal fluids of nine patients with proven H. influenzae meningitis. Thus, EIA systems utilizing short incubation times might be useful for the rapid detection of infectious antigens in body fluids...|$|R
