50|$|Acoustic droplet {{ejection}} {{was first}} reported in 1927 by Robert W. Wood and Alfred Loomis, who noted {{that when a}} high-power <b>acoustic</b> <b>generator</b> was immersed in an oil bath, a mound formed {{on the surface of}} the oil and, like a “miniature volcano,” ejected a continuous stream of droplets. Ripples that appear in a glass of water placed on a loud speaker show that acoustic energy can be converted to kinetic energy in a fluid. If the sound is turned up enough, droplets will jump from the liquid. This technique was refined in the 1970s and 1980s by Xerox and IBM and other organizations to provide a single droplet on-demand for printing ink onto a page. Two California-based companies, EDC Biosystems Inc. and Labcyte Inc., exploit acoustic energy for two separate functions: 1) as a liquid transfer device and 2) as a device for liquid auditing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCurrently, the {{development}} of compact opto-acoustic transducers able to generate and detect acoustic wave in the terahertz wavelength is an active research subject. Superlattice made with a periodic stacking of AlAs/GaAs layers has shown {{the ability to be}} used as high frequency <b>acoustic</b> <b>generators</b> and detectors. The excitation by a femtosecond laser leads to a temporally short strain in the pattern which produces quasi-monochromatic coherent phonons up to a frequency of 1 THz related to the multilayer period (excitation near $q= 0 $). This superlattice is an effective phonon detector since strain causes a change of reflectivity measured with a probe light. Unfortunately, generation and detection have differents spectrals responses: generation is more efficient around $q= 0 $, while detection works with $q= 2 k$ ($k$ is the light vector). Therefore a single superlattice cannot be used to detect and generate the same wave vector. However, theory predicts a rise of $q= 0 $ detection in case of strong reflection at the interface between superlattice and substrate. To check this possibility we design a sample made of a 17 nm period superlattice embedded in an optical micro-cavity. We will present experiments performed at low temperatures on a sample designed to generate and detect 300 GHz acoustic waves...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} sounds {{encountered in the}} natural environment is the harmonicity. Harmonicity is {{an essential component of}} music found in all cultures. It is also a unique feature of vocal communication sounds such as human speech and animal vocalizations. Harmonics in sounds are produced by a variety of <b>acoustic</b> <b>generators</b> and reflectors in the natural environment, including vocal apparatuses of humans and animal species as well as music instruments of many types. We live in an acoustic world full of harmonicity. Given the widespread existence of the harmonicity in many aspects of the hearing environment, it is natural to expect that it be reflected in the evolution and development of the auditory systems of both humans and animals, in particular the auditory cortex. Recent neuroimaging and neurophysiology experiments have identified regions of non-primary auditory cortex in humans and non-human primates that have selective responses to harmonic pitches. Accumulating evidence has also shown that neurons in many regions of the auditory cortex exhibit characteristic responses to harmonically related frequencies beyond the range of pitch.
