5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were taken}} to a bridge over the North Canadian River, six miles west and one mile south of Okemah. The bridge was {{described}} as on the old Schoolton road and at Yarbrough's crossing. According to the Associated Press <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Crisis,</b> Laura was raped. The Ledger reported that the men gagged Laura and L. D. with tow sacks and, using rope made of half-inch hemp tied in a hangman's knot, hanged them from the bridge. They {{were found in the}} morning hanging 20ft below the middle span. A local resident, John Earnest, reported the discovery to the sheriff's office.|$|E
5|$|In October 1918, with victory near, Downes {{was confronted}} by his most serious medical crisis. Damascus {{contained}} over 3,000 sick and wounded Turkish soldiers, {{many of them in}} appalling condition. Downes appointed the DADMS of the Australian Mounted Division, Major W. Evans, as Principal Medical Officer of Damascus, and gave him orders to organise the medical arrangements, bury the dead and provide care for the living. The task was made more difficult by the poor communications and transport shortages, which hampered the delivery of supplies and evacuation of the hospitals; by shortages of medical units; and by the actions of Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who was more concerned with establishing the political authority of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca over Damascus. At this point the Desert Mounted Corps itself began to experience epidemic diseases, particularly of bronchopneumonia, cholera and malaria, putting the medical services under enormous pressure. Through extraordinary measures, including the diversion of lighthorsemen and motor vehicles to medical units, Downes managed to evacuate the sick to Beirut, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> abated.|$|E
