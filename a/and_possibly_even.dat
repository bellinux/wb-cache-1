5|$|There is some {{speculation}} that the assassination of Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo in 1897 was at least supported or influenced by Betances, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> planned by him (although there is no physical link that can be established that might link Betances to the event itself).|$|E
5|$|As a result, Maslama {{launched}} {{another attack}} aimed at Tyana, with his nephew al-Abbas ibn al-Walid as co-commander. The chronology {{of the expedition}} is again unclear: the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor puts it in A.M. 6201 (708/709 AD, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> 709/710), but Arab sources date it to A.H. 88 and 89 (706/707 AD and 707/708 AD respectively). As a result, the siege has been variously dated to 707–708 AD and 708–709 AD.|$|E

5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Volcanoes {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be active if they have had eruptions during the Holocene. However, {{as demonstrated by the}} unexpected eruption of Chaiten volcano in Chile in May 2008, even long-inactive volcanoes can become active again. Such volcanoes can constitute a threat to regions with seemingly quiet volcanism. Ciomadul has had repose periods of over 10,000 years <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> longer. Zircon crystallization data imply that the magma chambers of Ciomadul were active over time spans of over 300,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
50|$|A much-debated {{question}} {{is that of the}} contribution Tielke himself made to the instruments signed with his name.

5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
5|$|The early Earth {{during the}} Hadean eon is {{believed}} by most scientists {{to have had}} a Venus-like atmosphere, with roughly 100 bar of CO2 and a surface temperature of 230°C, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> sulfuric acid clouds, until about 4.0billion years ago, by which time plate tectonics were in full force and together with the early water oceans, removed the CO2 and sulfur from the atmosphere. Early Venus would thus most likely have had water oceans like the Earth, but any plate tectonics would have ended when Venus lost its oceans. Its surface is estimated to be about 500million years old, so it would not be expected to show evidence of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E

30|$|For {{all other}} attacks, we repeat the {{requirements}} by Yang et al. [11]. In future work, the main directions are as follows: (i) to critically evaluate any proposed security solution, including vulnerability analysis and measurements and emulations, and (ii) security protocols must be resilient <b>and</b> robust, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> against unknown attacks. By no means must a security protocol proposal make idealistic assumptions.|$|R
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore {{what is now the}} Bering Sea area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they could not make out the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> unrecorded episodes.|$|E
5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E
5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} most attention, many insects are {{beneficial}} {{to the environment and}} to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1190s, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles, an Argyllman who was {{probably}} a meic Somairle candidate, was deposed and replaced by Michael (died 1203), a Manxman who {{appears to have been}} backed by Rǫgnvaldr. Cristinus' tenure appears to have spanned at least two decades, during a sustained period of meic Somairle power in the Isles. His downfall, however, came about at about time of the Crovan dynasty's resurgence under Rǫgnvaldr. The latter succeeded his father only years before, in 1187, and appears to have capitalised upon the infighting amongst the meic Somairle, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> the downfall of Ragnall himself. Although the first known Bishop of Argyll, Haraldr, is accorded a tenure during {{the first quarter of the}} thirteenth century, it is likely that there were earlier bishops unknown to surviving sources. In fact, the diocese first appears on record in Liber Censuum, a Papal document dating to the last decade of the twelfth century; and it is possible that Cristinus, or an unknown successor, or perhaps even Haraldr himself, was the first dicocesan bishop. Whatever the case, Cristinus' tenure in the Isles may have witnessed an ecclesiastical reorientation, or shift of sorts, towards Argyll.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the duke of Suffolk's murder, Beaumont had been an {{associate}} of the by now recalcitrant Richard, duke of York, having been one of the duke's feoffees in May 1436 and March 1441, <b>and</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> acting as the duke's councillor on occasion. He had also joined York on the king's council during York's first Protectorate (March 1453 – January 1454). But as York drew further from the court, so Beaumont appears to have moved towards it; although he appears to have not been present at the first battle of St Albans in 1455, he had already stood with the king against York at the latter's stand-off with king at Dartford in 1452, and then sat in judgment on some of his men. He eventually joined the anti-Neville faction at court; although his wife was a Neville, her family had by now aligned themselves with the duke of York. He was amongst the party of lords that reported to parliament that the king was sick and they 'coud not rouse him' in March 1454. He was also an arbitrator between York and the king's party, headed by the duke of Somerset after the king's recovery in 1454; although Griffiths says not a 'strictly impartial' one. Indeed, Griffiths suggests that his appointment to the council on 15 April 1454, after the king's recovery and York's dismissal, was part of a concerted attempt to 're-balance' the council after the protectorate. He was even reported (although wrongly) to have been recruiting an army to march against London in 1454. He {{was one of the few}} Lords Temporal to remain in Henry VI's council in the closing years of the decade, by which time he was the queen's chief steward. He was also part of the royal commission set up by parliament in July 1455 to examine royal household expenditure; the trust the Queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 January 1457 when he was appointed to the council of the young Prince of Wales, which had responsibility for his estate management, expenditure, personnel, and administration.|$|E
