40|$|Lattice slabs are {{usual in}} Brazil. They are formed by precast joists with {{latticed}} bars on {{a base of}} concrete, and a cover of concrete placed at the jobsite. The assembly of the joists and the filling elements is simple and do not require manpower with great skill, presenting low cost-benefit ratio. However, it is precisely in <b>assembling</b> <b>phase</b> that arise questions related to the scaffold support distance. A mistake in the proper positioning can lead to two undesirable situations. In one of them, a small space between the support lines increases the cost of scaffold, and in other an excessive space can generate exaggerated displacements, and even {{the collapse of the}} slab in the stage of concreting. The objective of this work is to analyze the bearing capacity of lattice joists in <b>assembling</b> <b>phase,</b> looking for information that is useful in defining the scaffold support distance.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} that {{the introduction of a}} temperature gradient along the free surface induces a particular stripe pattern in phase-separating fluids. The horizontal temperature gradient drove lateral-periodic spiral liquid motion flowing from warmer to cooler places due to thermocapillarity. Properly chosen polymer compositions and initial film thicknesses in ternary solutions allowed us to promote a phase separation in the presence of spiral flow, which assembled the demixed polymer droplets along the flow-stagnation lines. The resulting <b>assembled</b> <b>phases</b> aligned in the temperature gradient direction and eventually formed periodic polymer stripes involving the same spacing as that of the flow axis.

40|$|Cytoskeletal {{filaments}} {{are capable}} of self-assembly {{in the absence of}} externally supplied chemical energy, but the rapid turnover rates essential for their biological function require a constant flux of ATP or GTP hydrolysis. The same is true for protein assemblies employed in the formation of vesicles from cellular membranes, which rely on ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes to rapidly disassemble upon completion of the process. Recent observations suggest that the nucleolus, p granules and other mebraneless organelles may also demand dissipation of chemical energy to maintain their fluidity. We present a minimal model to study the relationships among dissipation, binding energy and rates of turnover or disassembly in a self-limiting assembly process with active monomer removal. After confirming that significant kinetic acceleration can be obtained under physiological parameters without melting the structure, we identify a new signature of far-from-equilibrium dynamics in the fluctuations of the <b>assembled</b> <b>phase.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The finite element model, including {{the spring and}} {{the upper and lower}} spring seats, is firstly described in the paper; the spring geometry was accurately obtained by a reverse engineering procedure based on two video cameras and a video projector. Surface to surface contact elements were defined between spring and seats; the initial <b>assembling</b> <b>phase</b> of the spring between the seats was also included in the finite element analysis.

A fully satisfactory agreement was generally observed between numerical results and experiments. The effect of lower spring seat orientation on results was also investigated by numerical analysis.

40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{irregularities}} of typical semistructured Web data, extraction tools usually break the extraction task in two phases: an extraction phase, in which atomic attribute values are extracted from Web pages, and an <b>assembling</b> <b>phase,</b> in which these atomic values are grouped to form complex objects. As a consequence, the whole process is highly dependent on the attribute values collected in the rst phase. All attribute values of interest should be properly recognized and spurious values should be discarded. Thus, attribute values extraction is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework for generating attribute value extractors. The main appeal of this framework {{is that it can}} be adapted for dealing with speci c types of data sources and to incorporate distinct types of heuristics for achieving good extraction performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal, we present an implementation of this framework for data-rich Web pages and show how a number of simple heuristics, some of them presented in the recent literature, can be incorporated into this framework.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{electric}} {{vehicle routing problem}} with partial charge, nonlinear charging function, and capacitated charging stations (E-VRP-NL-C). Decisions in the E-VRP-NL-C concern not only the sequence in which the customers are to be served, but also where {{and how much to}} charge the batteries in each route. The special features of the problem are that: 1) the function describing the relationship between the time spent charging the vehicle and the amount of charged energy is nonlinear and 2) a maximum number of EVs can simultaneously charge at each charging station (CS). We propose different MILP formulations for the E-VRP-NL-C and study the efficiency of these continuous-time models when running on a commercial solver. We also introduce a route first-assemble second approach to tackle the E-VRP-NL-C. In the routing phase the method uses an iterated local search embedding a variable neighborhood descent scheme. It combines simple components from the literature and components specifically designed to consider charging decisions and the limited number of chargers available at each CS.

Many physical constraints such as maximum copper trace line density, power consumption of line drivers, transmission line effects and heat dissipation, limit the maximum data throughput achievable for conventional electronic backplanes.

Therefore, by replacing the electronic transceivers in a backplane with optical transmitters and receivers, we can circumvent many {{of the limitations of}} conventional electronic backplanes and obtain higher data traffic.

40|$|Poroelasticity and {{mechanics}} of growth are playing an increasingly relevant role in biomechanics. This {{work is a}} self- contained and holistic presentation of the modeling and simulation of non-linear poroelasticity with and without growth inhomogeneities. Balance laws of poroelasticity are derived in Cartesian coordinates. These allow to write the governing equations {{in a form that}} is general but also readily implementable. Closure relations are formally derived from the study of dissipation. We propose an approximation scheme for the poroelasticity problem based on an implicit Euler method for the time discretization and a finite element method for the spatial discretization. The non-linear system is solved by means of Newton's method. Time integration of the growth tensor is discussed for the specific case in which the rate of inelastic deformations is prescribed. We discuss the stability of the mixed finite element discretization of the arising saddle-point problem. We show that a linear finite element approximation of both the unknowns, that is not LBB compliant for the elasticity problem, is nevertheless stable when applied to the linearized poroelasticity problem. This choice enables a fast <b>assembling</b> <b>phase.</b> The discretization of the poroelastic system may present unphysical oscillations if the spatial and temporal step-sizes are not properly chosen. We study the source of these wiggles by comparing the pressure Schur complement to a reaction- diffusion problem. From our analysis, we define a novel Péclet number for the poroelastic system and we show how it depends on the shear and bulk moduli of the solid phase. This number allows to introduce a stability condition that ensures that the solution is free of unphysical oscillations. If this condition on the Péclet number is not met, we introduce a fluid pressure Laplacian stabilization in order to remove the wiggles. This stabilization technique depends on a numerical parameter, whose optimal value is given by the derived Péclet number. Finally, we propose a coupled elastic-poroelastic model for the simulation of a tooth-periodontal ligament system. Because of the high resolution required by this system, we develop an efficient multigrid Newton's method for the non-linear poroelasticity system. The stability condition has again a significant influence on the performances of this solver. If the condition on the Péclet number is not satisfied on all levels of the multigrid algorithm, poor convergence rates or even divergence of the solver can be observed. The stabilization of the coarse grid operators with the optimal fluid pressure Laplacian method is a simple and efficient method to improve the convergence rate of the multigrid solver applied to this saddle-point system. We validate our coupled model against experimental measurements realized by the group of Prof. Bourauel at the University of Bonn...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{a deeper}} understanding of the microstructural factors that origin and influence non-ohmic behaviour in ZnO ceramics. The third chapter presents results and discussion of the classical simulation results. We have carried out calculations on a large number of twist and tilt grain boundary systems and we have investigated the energetics and segregation properties of cobalt and barium to the Σ 7 twist grain boundary core. We have determined the energies of a large number of twist and tilt boundaries and seen how they fit into known models. The structural units of the Σ 13 tilt boundaries were identified and systems for the ab initio calculations selected. The electronic structure calculations on twist grain boundaries are presented in chapter four, along with the results for segregation of antimony and bismuth to the Σ 7 and Σ 13 boundaries. We have found a limit doping that is approximately the same for very different twist and tilt boundaries and suggests a maximum for the density of interfacial impurity states. The impurity states found were of a donor type and, although they were approximately in the right position in the band gap, they did not correspond to the acceptor states associated with varistor behaviour. The fifth chapter describes the results on tilt grain boundaries and doping with antimony, bismuth and defect complexes. We have investigated the shallow interface states that result from the tilt grain boundaries, the states introduced by oxygen interstitial impurities, the effect of Zn vacancies and the electronic structure of defect complexes. The sixth chapter presents a model intergranular film boundary. The charges, interface states and energetics are analysed as well as the possible origin of the compensation mechanism in intergranular thin films. We suggest that these films can be electrically active. The seventh chapter contains unrelated work on solid phases of Met-Car analogue clusters.

40|$|The idea {{to apply}} {{self-healing}} composites in aeronautics {{is one of}} the biggest challenge facing materials scientists. Composite materials are subject to weakening due to impact damage on the structural integrity of the material. Most damaging mechanical stresses in the aircraft are the impacts of the hail on the fuselage crown during a storm, the strong impact of the stones on the keel during the grounding, the accidental fall of the heavy object on the structure during the <b>assembling</b> <b>phases</b> and, in the worst case, the bird impact during the landing and the taking off. Impact damage may lead to substantial matrix microcraking, delamination and fibre-matrix de-bonding of the composite, reducing the structural capability and leading to premature failure, if the damage is not detected and repaired. A self-healing composite has the amazing capability to protect against material failure due to fatigue, to greatly improve structure safety and reliability and to extend product lifetime. A lot of self-repair strategies were proposed in literature, and the solutions to the problem are undergoing rapid changes, which they are approaching to the goal ever more. One of the most promising self-healing systems for aircraft polymer composites is based on microencapsulated systems. This development of an aeronautical material based on such a design has highlighted several restrictions: a) the impossibility to use hardeners as aromatic primary amines (e. g. DDS) in combination with pre-catalysts active in the ROMP; b) the impossibility to use curing cycles at high temperatures as those scheduled for aeronautic materials designed for primary structures; c) the impossibility to use the pre-catalyst dispersed in the form of molecular complex in chemically very reactive environments, such as fluid epoxy mixtures containing reactive epoxy rings at high temperatures and d) the high cost of ruthenium based pre-catalysts which have proven to give high yield in ROMP reactions of polyolefins.

We investigated the effect of glucocorticoids on the in vivo chromatin structure of the glucocorticoid-responsive IκBα gene promoter, the inhibitor of the ubiquitous transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). Glucocorticoids inhibit NFκB activity in some tissues by elevating the levels of IκBα. We found that glucocorticoids activated the IκBα promoter in human T 47 D/A 1 - 2 cells containing the GR.

The compound was found to have increased biostability compared to stabilised linear peptides, displayed good binding towards monoclonal antibodies known to bind to HNE and thus has potential in an alternative peptide-based measles vaccine...|$|R
40|$|The 13 -residue peptide, chi-conotoxin MrIA {{extracted}} from the venom of Conus marmoreus, is a potent and selective inhibitor of the human noradrenaline transporter (NET). With the aim of improving its biophysical properties, chemical modifications were performed including the attachment of a lipophilic amino acid at the N-terminus and cyclisation of the peptide backbone with functionality introduced into the linker. All chi-conotoxin MrIA analogues were <b>assembled</b> on solid <b>phase</b> by highly optimised Boc chemistry and N- to C-cyclic analogues accessed by cysteine-mediated intramolecular native chemical ligation. In vitro biological activity at the human NET was evaluated by functional assays. All analogues inhibited the uptake of [H- 3]noradrenaline with comparable potencies {{to that of the}} native peptide, with one of the analogues, the linear N-terminal aminotetradecanoyl MrIA showing a 3 -fold increase in potency (p < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Newly {{developed}} magnetic {{devices are}} used to create an interface between adjacent mirror segments so that once <b>assembled,</b> aligned, and <b>phased,</b> the multiple segments will behave functionally equivalent to a monolithic aperture mirror. One embodiment might be a kinematic interface that is reversible so that any number of segments can be pre-assembled, aligned, and phased to facilitate fabrication operations, and then disassembled and reassembled, aligned, and phased in space for operation. The interface mechanism has sufficient stiffness, force, and stability to maintain phasing. The key to producing an interface is the correlated magnetic surface. While conventional magnets are only constrained in one direction [...] the direction defined by their point of contact (they are in contact and cannot get any closer) [...] correlated magnets can be designed to have constraints in multiple degrees of freedom. Additionally, correlated magnetic surfaces can be designed to have a limited range of action...|$|R
