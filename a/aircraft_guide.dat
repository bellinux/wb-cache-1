5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed <b>aircraft,</b> <b>guided</b> missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|R
