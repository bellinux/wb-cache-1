5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. One section of the modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected {{from the rest of}} M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E
5|$|Northern Bloomsburg and Scott Township {{include a}} small oxbow lake of Fishing Creek; {{the area around}} this lake {{is known as the}} Turkey Hill Oxbow. The lake is located between Interstate 80 and the forests on the side of Turkey Hill. The oxbow is on a flood plain and {{includes}} grasses, forested wetlands, and areas of open water. In wet periods of the year, the Turkey Hill Oxbow lake receives overflow from the waters of Fishing Creek while during dry periods it contains water in only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, Permian sandstones are found in only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 2005, {{during an}} {{official}} state visit to Latvia, Bush {{was awarded the}} Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street {{in honor of the}} U.S. president. Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier. A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007. In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>places,</b> such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in Gabon and across southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
