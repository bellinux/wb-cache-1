40|$|A {{number of}} signal {{processing}} algorithms were developed for analyzing ultrasonic signals {{used to measure}} aircraft ice accretion in flight. A high speed digital signal acquisition system was designed and constructed to acquire the signals. The ultrasonic signals were acquired during a series of flight tests in <b>actual</b> <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> This digital data {{was used to evaluate}} various algorithms for determining the ice thickness. An analog data acquisition system provided data for comparison with the digital data. A gated peak detector, employing low signal to noise ratio filtering and derivative preprocessing, was developed.

A "Key Decision Point" was established for fiscal year 2007 with the following expected outcomes: document the most currently available statistical/prognostic data associated with icing for subsonic transport, summarize reports by subject matter experts in icing research on current knowledge of icing effects on control parameters and establish future requirements for icing research for subsonic transports including the appropriate alignment. This study contains: (1) statistical analyses of accident and incident data conducted by NASA researchers for this "Key Decision Point", (2) an examination of icing in other recent statistically based studies, (3) a summary of aviation safety priority lists that have been developed by various subject-matter experts, including the significance of aircraft icing research in these lists and (4) suggested future requirements for NASA icing research.

Using the in-flight data to establish the IRT and Lewice as accurate simulators of <b>actual</b> <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> is crucial for supporting the research done in the Icing Branch. During test flights during the 2003 and 2004 flight season, a Natural Ice Shape Database was collected.

The duration of this period is usually determined by the pilot s ability to safely control the aircraft. When safe flight is no longer possible, the aircraft is maneuvered into clear air above the cloud layer. At this point several photographs are taken of the ice shape that was accreted on the wing test section during this icing encounter using a stereo photograph system (Figure 1). The stereo photograph system utilizes two cameras located at different locations on the fuselage that are both pointed at the same location on the wing. When both cameras take photographs of the same location at the same time, the negatives can be combined digitally to generate a two dimensional plot describing the cross-section of the ice shape.

40|$|Several {{interaction}} processes can {{be identified}} during floe ice - sloping structure interactions. However, fierce processes around the waterline are the most conspicuous phenomena. These violent processes feature ice fracturing and the potential rotation of subsequent ice blocks. This thesis focuses primarily on the fracture of ice floes. The exact failure pattern of an ice floe {{is complicated by the}} <b>actual</b> <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in which the sloping structure is positioned. Regarding the <b>ice</b> <b>condition,</b> we do not predefine it as a ‘level ice’ or a ‘broken ice’ field. Instead, considering an ice field composed of ice floes of varying sizes is a more realistic approach. Studying the interaction between an ice floe and a sloping structure (i. e., floe ice - sloping structure interactions) can yield more general results because an ice floe has a spatial scale that typically ranges from 10 m to 10 km. The ice floe can be large enough to be regarded as level ice or can be small enough to be treated {{as a member of a}} broken ice field. Currently, Arctic exploration and exploitation are expanding into a relatively ‘open’ <b>ice</b> <b>condition,</b> within which, a knowledge gap exists regarding the fracture of a finite size ice floe in the context of ice-structure interactions. To advance our understanding, this thesis studied the following observed failure modes of a finite size ice floe within such an ‘open’ ice condition: 1) In-plane splitting failure; 2) Out-of-plane flexural failure; and 3) Competition between different failure modes in the context of ice - sloping structure interactions. This thesis addresses influential factors, such as an ice floe’s size, geometry, confinement, and ice-structure contact properties. In a decoupled manner, these different failure modes were studied primarily using the concept of fracture mechanics. The major contributions of this study are the following: 1) Analytical solutions for each failure mode were proposed for ice floes of varying sizes, which range over a large spatial scale (i. e., from approximately 1 m to 10 km); and 2) Each analytical solution within the established analytical framework was rigorously verified, either by numerical simulations, existing idealised analytical results, experimental measurements, or all of the above. Theoretically, through derivations, implementations and validations of all these analytical solutions, many interesting results were obtained, such as the following: 1) The validity of using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) to study an ice floe’s splitting failure on an engineering scale was confirmed; 2) An ice floe’s confinement has a much more profound effect on increasing the force required to split an ice floe in comparison with the influence of floe geometry; 3) Three out-of-plane flexural failure scenarios were further conservatively identified and analytically studied; and 4) A floe size requirement (i. e., a square floe’s size L < 27 (ice thickness) 3 / 4) was suggested for the radial-crack-initiation-controlled fracture of an ice floe. From a practical point of view, with all these analytical solutions of failure modes at our disposal, we are thus able to construct a failure map that relates an ice floe’s dominant failure mode to its geometry, relevant contact and material properties. In addition, these analytical formulae can be effectively incorporated with multi-body dynamic simulators to assess the performance of Arctic offshore structures in ice over large temporal and spatial scales. In addition, as opposed to relatively ‘open’ <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> we have also studied ice - sloping structure interaction in ‘tight’ <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> One extreme interaction scenario within these <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> is when a large amount of ice rubble accumulates in front of a sloping structure. This scenario has long been recognised as one of the controlling design conditions and has previously been under thorough investigation. In this thesis, a novel approach that combines both physical model tests (i. e., measured by tactile sensors and load cells) and a theoretical model was employed to study ice load’s spatial and temporal variations on a sloping structure under the influence of rubble accumulation. The following results were found: 1) The presence of rubble accumulation increases the global ice resistance; 2) The maximum value of ice resistance occurs in a location below the waterline, which signifies the importance of the ice rotating process and rubble accumulation effect; and 3) The developed theoretical model, which was validated by both physical model tests and existing theoretical models, can serve as a preliminary tool to study ice load’s temporal and spatial distribution under the influence of rubble accumulation. As an extension, we also explored a seemingly promising numerical method’s (i. e., the Cohesive Element Method (CEM)) applicability in studying ice - sloping structure interactions under the influence of rubble accumulation. Preliminary results demonstrate that there is still a substantial knowledge/computational gap in using this numerical method to simulate ice and sloping structure interactions in a three-dimensional setting. The primary deliverable contributions of this thesis to the scientific and engineering community are the proposed analytical solutions and the framework for different failure modes under two different <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Such analytical treatment prepared us to simulate loads related to floe ice - sloping structure interactions, which are important for Arctic exploration and exploitation on large temporal and spatial scales...|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} in the polar marine areas is increasing from offshore and shipping activities supporting both commercial and tourist operations. Particular of interest is the expansion in offshore {{oil and gas exploration}} and productions activities in ice covered waters in the northern hemisphere. The presence of sea ice is the main factor for the complexity for operations in these regions. The presence of sea ice is the main factor hindering the operations in Arctic. Sea ice is a complex material, and induces high pressures in contact with ships or structures. Different types of sea ice and their mechanical and physical properties are briefly described. There exist different models for calculation of contact pressure acting on a vessel or a structure due to ice. This thesis will briefly present three different and popular approaches to predict ice pressure on structures and ships, namely; empirical pressure relationships, physical models and stochastic models. The best approach to predict ice pressure depends much on the problem and what kind of data that is available. Ice class rules for vessels operating in ice infested waters are reviewed. The ice-class rules developed by IACS and DNV are summarized, and both principles behind the rules and the numerical values have been compared. The main difference is that IACS us a plastic method of approach, while DNV uses an elastic method. Despite the difference in method of analyses, the numerical comparison shows they are relative similar. The IACS rules are typically most conservative for larger vessels with large displacement, while the DNV rules are conservative for smaller vessels with small displacement. A review of two different formulations for estimation of ice resistance for ship is given. This is inexpensive analytical models that can give an early estimation of the ice resistance and power requirement. Using main properties from KV Svalbard the two different formulations is compared, and they seem two compare quite well for thin ice (h i < 1 m) when the vessel speed is low. For higher vessels speeds the results differs more from each other. The increasing {{activity in}} polar areas is the main motivation for Det Norske Veritas project Ice Load and Monitoring (ILM). The overall aim of the ILM-project is to increase the knowledge about the <b>actual</b> <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> a vessel meets and its effect on the hull. As a part of the project a prototype of a monitoring system was mounted on the coast guard vessel KV Svalbard, which is described. During research work with KV Svalbard for a total of two weeks in late March 2007 operating in ice covered waters around Spitsbergen, measurement from the ILM-system was stored for later usage. Based on conservation of energy a formulation is outlined to describe how the ice resistance can be estimated for a particular case. In this thesis KV Svalbard is used with available measurements of ice thickness, speed and power from the voyage in late March 2007. The estimated resistance is compared with the two reviewed formulations from literature, and the trend in the results seems to agree well. In the final task, a regression analysis was used to find the "best fit" line or curve to the estimated resistance of KV Svalbard. Different Least Square curves was evaluated and discussed and it was found out that an exponential curve fitted best to the estimated data.  </p...|$|R

We evaluated <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from a model based on degree days, calibrated to satellite observations, to estimate distribution and long-term trends in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon. Model results compared favorably with ground observations and 26. years of satellite data, allowing <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> to be reconstructed back to 1943. Specifically, periods of significant (limited access to eelgrass areas) and severe (almost complete ice coverage of the lagoon) <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> could be identified. The number of days of severe ice within a single season ranged from 0 (e. g., 2001) to 2 ̆ 265 67 (e. g., 2000).

40|$|Ice loads {{represent}} the dominant load for ice-going ships, {{and it is}} important to estimate both global and local ice loads on ship hulls. The global ice load governs the ship’s overall performance in ice, and it is an integrated effect of local ice loads over the hull area. Information on the distributions of local ice loads around the hull can be used for more effective design of ice-going ships both in terms of overall operation and from the structural point of view. The present thesis focuses on a numerical model for simulating ice–hull interaction and ship maneuvers in level ice. This model is partly based on the empirical data, by which the observed phenomena of continuous icebreaking can be reproduced. In the simulation of a full-scale icebreaking run, the interdependence between the ice load and the ship’s motion is considered, and the three degree-of-freedom (DOF) rigid body equations of surge, sway and yaw are solved by numerical integration. The thickness and strength properties of the ice encountered by the ship are assumed to be constant or predefined based on the statistical data. Accordingly the global and local ice loads on ship hulls can be obtained in a deterministic or probabilistic way. The convergence tests are carried out {{to make sure that this}} numerical method can give a convergent solution of both global and local ice loads. The computation time is also examined with the purpose of determining a balance between the computation time and the convergence. The influences of the assumptions and simplifications made in this numerical model are analyzed by changing different parameters and comparing with an empirical method and the measured data. The simulation results are discussed through three case studies, in which the global ice load effects on ship’s performance, the probabilistic and spatial variations of local ice loads around the hull and the short-term distribution of maximum ice loads on a frame are respectively analyzed and compared with field measurements conducted in the Baltic Sea. The ship’s performance in level ice is usually described by the speed that the ship can attain in the ice of a certain thickness. A case study with an icebreaker, Tor Viking II, is carried out by using the simulation program. In this study, the ice encountered by the ship is assumed to be uniform. The ship’s motion is obtained by solving the equations of motion in which the thrust and the global ice load both are identified. The speed that the ship can attain is then simulated in the ice of different thicknesses. The simulation results agree well with the full-scale measurements. The turning circle diameter which is a measure of the ship’s maneuverability in ice is also investigated by using the simulation program. Herein the ship is assumed to turn freely with a given rudder angle, and the simulated turning circles are comparable to the full-scale ice trials. It is also found that the ship’s performance can be considerably affected by the geometry of simulated icebreaking patterns. If the shoulder crushing takes place (i. e. the ice is continuously crushed by hull shoulder without bending failure) both the forward speed and the turning rate of the ship will be significantly slowed down. This phenomenon is also observed in full-scale trials, but it is difficult to learn about its effect on ship’s performance as the <b>actual</b> <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in-service usually are uncontrollable. It is expected that numerical simulations can supplement full-scale tests in providing more details about the continuous icebreaking processes and the global ice load effects on ship’s performance. The local ice loading process has a clear stochastic nature due to variations in the <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> and in the icebreaking processes of ships. A case study with an icebreaking tanker, MT Uikku, is carried out by using the simulation program. In this study, the thickness and strength properties of the ice encountered by the ship are assumed to be constant or randomly generated using the Monte Carlo method. It is found that the variation of simulated ice loading process on a frame is noteworthy even if the ice properties are fixed. If the statistical variation of the <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> is considered, then the distributions of simulated load peaks are found to be comparable to the measured statistical distributions. In this case study, the spatial distribution of local ice loads around the hull is also investigated. The simulation results agree with previous experimental studies, that the turning operation may develop a high load level on the aft shoulder area. <b>Ice</b> <b>conditions</b> and ship operations in ice vary in the short term from voyage to voyage and in the long term from winter to winter. Long-term ice load measurements conducted in the Baltic Sea consist mainly of 12 -hour load maxima which are gathered during the normal operation of the ship over several years. A case study with a chemical tanker, MS Kemira, is carried out by using the simulation program. In this study, the statistical data on the strength properties of Baltic Sea ice are applied and the thickness of the ice encountered by the ship are classified referring to the full-scale measurements onboard MS Kemira. The 12 -hour maximum ice loads on a frame are evaluated by fitting a Gumbel I asymptotic extreme value distribution to the simulated 10 -min load maxima in a certain <b>ice</b> <b>condition.</b> It can be expected that if a reasonable variance of the ice thickness is defined, the simulation results can be used for a preliminary estimation of the maximum ice loads within a 12 hours’ voyage in level ice. By applying the different ice thicknesses in simulations, the probable correlation between the simulated load maxima and the ice thickness is analyzed. A potential way to evaluate the long-term ice load statistics based on short-term simulations is then introduced. Up to now the main source of knowledge about ice load statistics has been field measurement. While field measurements will continue to be important, numerical methods can provide useful information, since they can be easily used to study the effect of different parameters. As far as we know the present numerical model is the first one to deal with multiple subjects including the ice–hull interaction, the overall performance of icebreaking ships and the statistics of local ice loads around the hull. It is hoped that further studies on this numerical model can supplement the field and laboratory measurements in establishing a design basis for the ice-going ships, especially for ships navigating in first-year <b>ice</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

The text matrix consisted of glaze, rime, and mixed <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Airflow and <b>icing</b> cloud <b>conditions</b> were set to correspond to those typical of the operating environment anticipated for a commercial transport vehicle. Results obtained included ice profile tracings, photographs of the ice accretions, and force balance measurements obtained both during the accretion process and in a past-accretion evaluation over a range of angles of attack. The tracings and photographs indicated significant accretions on the slat leading edge, in gaps between slat or flaps and the main wing, on the flap leading-edge surfaces, and on flap lower surfaces. Force measurements indicate the possibility of severe performance degradation, especially near C sub Lmax, for both light and heavy ice accretion and performance analysis codes presently in use. The LEWICE code was used to evaluate the ice accretion shape developed during one of the rime <b>ice</b> tests. The <b>actual</b> <b>ice</b> shape was then evaluated, using a Navier-Strokes code, for changes in performance characteristics.
