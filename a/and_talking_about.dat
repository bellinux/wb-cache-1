5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the {{publisher}} of The Hindu, drinking coffee <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews {{was the result of}} an interview with Time, after which Narayan had to spend a few days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs that were never used in the article.|$|E
5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E

500|$|Mike Marqusee {{has written}} at length on the {{conflicts}} in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He {{suggests that the}} song is probably self-referential: [...] "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that [...] "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> other people, I was really talking about nobody but me." ...|$|E

"That was a {{conscious}} move by Max and myself, {{because we were}} listening to alternative and indie music <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> some song– I don't remember what it was. I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E
500|$|In Paris in 1901 a large Van Gogh {{retrospective}} {{was held}} at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, which excited André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck, and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism. Important group exhibitions took place with the Sonderbund artists in Cologne in 1912, the Armory Show, New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914. Henk Bremmer was instrumental in teaching <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Van Gogh, and introduced Helene Kröller-Müller to Van Gogh's art; she became an avid collector of his work. [...] The early figures in German Expressionism such as Emil Nolde acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh's work.

"The filming {{process was}} an {{efficient}} one, {{and it was}} going so well {{that in the middle}} of the production Cukor asked Hepburn to talk to Judy Garland in an attempt to convince Garland of the need to sober up. In order to add realism to the production, Cukor consulted reporters from United Press for advice on how newspapermen would handle Forrest's funeral. Based on their critiques, Cukor changed the scene in the village hotel's bar so that instead of drinking <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the funeral, the reporters get to work drafting articles on their typewriters. The script, too, was changed to permit the bartender to make a quip about reporters working rather than drinking.|$|E

[...] Biographer John Carvel, a journalist from The Guardian, remarked that Livingstone's political motivation was a [...] "fundamental desire... for a more participative, cooperative society", leading him to oppose [...] "concentrations of power and... exploitation in all its forms – economic, racial and sexual." [...] However, Livingstone has also described his approach to fiscal policy as [...] "monetarist": [...] "I was a monetarist right from the beginning when I was leader of the GLC.

Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information.

Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's another thing to go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good."
