5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>switchover</b> of a {{redundant}} system on an error condition, without human intervention, is called failover. Manual switchover on error {{would be used}} if automatic failover is not available, possibly because the overall system is too complex.|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} IBM 1750, 2750 and 3750 Switching Systems was {{developed}} from the IBM 1800 by the IBM La Gaude Research Laboratory near Nice, France for European markets only. Each system included twin stored-program controllers (each with 32K main storage, some 600,000 lines of code, and nightly and emergency <b>automatic</b> <b>switchover),</b> twin disks, and solid-state switching. Extension, trunk and tie lines were connected by discrete transistors on plug-in panels. All systems were assembled in IBM Montpellier.|$|E
5000|$|MC-LAG adds node-level {{redundancy}} to {{the normal}} link-level redundancy that a LAG provides. This allows two or more nodes to share a common LAG endpoint. The multiple nodes present a single logical LAG to the remote end. Note that MC-LAG implementations are vendor-specific, but cooperating chassis remain externally compliant to the IEEE 802.1AX-2008 standard. [...] Nodes in an MC-LAG cluster communicate to synchronize and negotiate <b>automatic</b> <b>switchovers</b> (failover). Some implementations may support administrator-initiated (manual) switchovers.|$|R
40|$|Critical {{medium voltage}} {{substations}} are often fed {{by at least}} 2 transformers. When the short-circuit power reaches unacceptable levels, a system with <b>automatic</b> <b>switchovers</b> can provide a solution. With this system, each transformer feeds its own bus bar (see Fig. 1). The transformers are able to feed both bus bars (e. g. for maintenance). When one transformer breaks down, the other will take over its bus bar, but only after the voltage has dropped. To avoid this voltage drop, a DC coupling between both bus bars could be used. This link only adds {{a limited amount of}} short circuit power and is able to take over the other bus bar immediately, to exchange an arbitrary amount of power between the bus bars, etc [...] . The technology (back-to-back converter) already exists, but the application is unknown to the major manufacturers. The goal of this thesis is to develop the concept of this solution, to design a protection scheme, to propose boundary conditions to take over a bus bar, etc [...] . The transient behavior of the system should be modeled to provide insight on the impact of the system, e. g. during and after fault clearing. Practical aspects: This thesis does not require regular visits to the BASF Antwerp site. An initial meeting will be held at BASF Antwerp (guided tour around the BASF Antwerp installations, discuss about the present concept and boundary conditions of <b>automatic</b> <b>switchovers,</b> etc [...] .)

40|$|Omni and NASA Test Operations at Stennis {{entered a}} Dual-Use Agreement {{to develop the}} FOTR- 125, a 125 megabit-per-second fiber-optic {{transceiver}} that allows accurate digital recordings over a great distance. The transceiver s fiber-optic link can be as long as 25 kilometers. This makes it much longer than the standard coaxial link, which can be no longer than 50 meters. The FOTR- 125 utilizes laser diode transmitter modules and integrated receivers for the optical interface. Two transmitters and two receivers are employed {{at each end of}} the link with <b>automatic</b> or manual <b>switchover</b> to maximize the reliability of the communications link. NASA uses the transceiver in Stennis High-Speed Data Acquisition System (HSDAS). The HSDAS consists of several identical systems installed on the Center s test stands to process all high-speed data related to its propulsion test programs. These transceivers allow the recorder and HSDAS controls to be located in the Test Control Center in a remote location while the digitizer is located on the test stand...|$|R
50|$|Localizer, glideslope, {{and other}} {{instrument}} landing aids (such as microwave transmitters) are both high power consumers and mission-critical, and cannot be reliably operated from a battery supply, even for short periods. Hence, when absolute reliability is required (such as when Category 3 operations are in {{force at the}} airport) it is usual to run the system from a diesel generator with <b>automatic</b> <b>switchover</b> to the mains supply should the generator fail. This avoids any interruption to transmission while a generator is brought up to operating speed.|$|E

40|$|A high {{performance}} 5 MHz distribution system is described which has extremely low phase noise and jitter characteristics and provides multiple buffered outputs. The system is completely redundant with <b>automatic</b> <b>switchover</b> and is self-testing. Since the 5 MHz reference signals {{distributed by the}} NATO III distribution system are used for up-conversion and multiplicative functions, {{a high degree of}} phase stability and isolation between outputs is necessary. Unique circuit design and packaging concepts insure that the isolation between outputs is sufficient to quarantee a phase perturbation of less than 0. 0016 deg when other outputs are open circuited, short circuited or terminated in 50 ohms. Circuit design techniques include high isolation cascode amplifiers. Negative feedback stabilizes system gain and minimizes circuit phase noise contributions. Balanced lines, in lieu of single ended coaxial transmission media, minimize pickup...|$|E
40|$|A device (1) and {{a process}} {{performed}} with it serve {{to regulate the}} speed and/or the power dissipation in an electric motor (2) connected to an alternating current network. The proposal involves switching an intermittent alternating current to the motor (2) {{by means of a}} sampling controller (7). Each gap is at least one full wave long so that intermittent operation works with alternating voltage half-waves in phase opposition. In order to adapt power dissipation to the momentary load torque and, if necessary, to regulate the motor speed as well, the voltage-time area (time integral) of the voltage half-waves switched to the motor can be varied and this is preferably performed by a phase control with angle of retard and advance (8). The device can also be equipped with additional devices for speed control and/or <b>automatic</b> <b>switchover</b> from intermittent to full operation and back (Fig. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|The R 2051 is a CMOS {{real-time}} clock IC {{connected to the}} CPU by two signal lines, SCL and SDA, and configured to perform serial transmission of time and calendar data to the CPU. Further, battery backup switchover circuit and a voltage detector are incorporated. The periodic interrupt circuit is configured to generate interrupt signals with six selectable interrupts ranging from 0. 5 seconds to 1 month. The 2 alarm interrupt circuits generate interrupt signals at preset times. As the oscillation circuit is driven under constant voltage, fluctuation of the oscillator frequency due to supply voltage is small, and the time keeping current is small (TYP. 0. 4 µA at 3 V). The oscillation halt sensing circuit {{can be used to}} judge the validity of internal data in such events as power-on; The supply voltage monitoring circuit is configured to record a drop in supply voltage below two selectable supply voltage monitoring threshold settings. The 32. 768 kHz clock output function (CMOS output) is intended to output sub-clock pulses for the external microcomputer. The oscillation adjustment circuit is intended to adjust time counts with high precision by correcting deviations in the oscillation frequency of the quartz crystal unit. Battery backup switchover function is the <b>automatic</b> <b>switchover</b> circuit between a main power supply and a backup battery of primary or secondary battery. Switchover is executed by monitoring the voltage of a main power supply, therefore the voltage of a backup battery voltage is not relevant. Since the package for these ICs is SSOP 16 (5. 0 x 6. 4 x 1. 25 : R 2051 Sxx), FFP 12 (2. 0 x 2. 0 x 1. 0 : R 2051 Kxx), or TSSOP 10 G (4. 0 x 2. 9 x 1. 0 : R 2051 Txx), high density mounting of ICs on boards is possible...|$|E
