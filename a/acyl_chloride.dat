25|$|The {{simplest}} <b>acyl</b> <b>chloride</b> is ethanoyl chloride or acetyl chloride; methanoyl chloride is not stable.|$|E
25|$|The {{viability}} of the Friedel–Crafts acylation depends on {{the stability of the}} <b>acyl</b> <b>chloride</b> reagent. Formyl chloride, for example, is too unstable to be isolated. Thus, synthesis of benzaldehyde via the Friedel–Crafts pathway requires that formyl chloride be synthesized in situ. This is accomplished via the Gattermann-Koch reaction, accomplished by treating benzene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride under high pressure, catalyzed by a mixture of aluminium chloride and cuprous chloride.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{instructive}} but of {{far less}} industrial significance is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an alkyl halide {{in the presence}} of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the Friedel-Crafts acylation is a related example of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction involves the acylation of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an <b>acyl</b> <b>chloride</b> using a strong Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium chloride or Iron(III) chloride.|$|E
50|$|Sebacoyl {{chloride}} is a light-yellow liquid with a pungent odor, soluble in hydrocarbons and ethers. Sebacoyl chloride is corrosive; {{like all}} <b>acyl</b> <b>chlorides,</b> it hydrolyzes in water, evolving hydrogen chloride.

25|$|<b>Acyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> {{are reduced}} by strong hydride donors such as lithium {{aluminium}} hydride and diisobutylaluminium hydride to give primary alcohols.

25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} carboxylic acid derivatives, including acid anhydrides, esters, and amides by reacting acid chlorides with: a salt of a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or an amine respectively. The use of a base, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide or pyridine, or excess amine (when preparing amides) is desirable to remove the hydrogen chloride byproduct, and to catalyze the reaction. While it is often possible to obtain esters or amides from the carboxylic acid with alcohols or amines, the reactions are reversible, often leading to low yields. In contrast, both reactions involved in preparing esters and amides via acyl chlorides (<b>acyl</b> <b>chloride</b> formation from carboxylic acid, followed by coupling with the alcohol or amine) are fast and irreversible. This makes the two-step route often preferable to the single step reaction with the carboxylic acid.|$|E

2500|$|Friedel–Crafts {{acylation}} is the acylation of aromatic rings with an <b>acyl</b> <b>chloride</b> using {{a strong}} Lewis acid catalyst. Friedel–Crafts acylation {{is also possible}} with acid anhydrides. Reaction conditions {{are similar to the}} Friedel–Crafts alkylation [...] mentioned above. This reaction has several advantages over the alkylation reaction. Due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group, the ketone product is always less reactive than the original molecule, so multiple acylations do not occur. Also, there are no carbocation rearrangements, as the carbonium ion is stabilized by a resonance structure in which the positive charge is on the oxygen.|$|E
