5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>breakthrough</b> came in 1931, {{when the}} American {{pathologist}} Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza {{and several other}} viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{achieved}} <b>another</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in 1987, {{when she}} had leading roles in two television miniseries: Fortunes of War, a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh, and Tutti Frutti, a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane. For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received. In 1989, she and Branagh—who had formed a romantic relationship—starred in a stage revival of Look Back in Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company. Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.|$|E

[...] He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it. He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly, and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a [...] "master stroke" [...] in thwarting Congressional intervention.

2500|$|An {{editorial}} {{article in}} The Verge in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored {{some of the}} public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has [...] "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" [...] and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing <b>another</b> <b>breakthrough</b> moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating [...] "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the [...] "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want [...] "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that [...] "a device is only {{the starting point of}} an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that Walkman didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the iCloud cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an Apple Watch can unlock a Mac in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Woo {{announced}} in Cannes that his next movie would be 1949, an epic love story set {{between the end}} of World War II and Chinese Civil War to the founding of the People's Republic of China, the shooting of which would take place in China and Taiwan. Its production was due to begin by the end of 2008, with a theatrical release planned in December 2009. However, in early April 2009, the film was cancelled due to script right issues. Reports indicated that Woo might be working on another World War II film, this time about the American Volunteer Group, or the Flying Tigers. The movie was tentatively titled [...] "Flying Tiger Heroes" [...] and Woo is reported as saying it will feature [...] "The most spectacular aerial battle scenes ever seen in Chinese cinema." [...] It was not clear whether Woo would not be directing the earlier war film, or whether it was put on the back burner.

2500|$|In the mid-1960s, {{the role}} of tRNA in protein {{synthesis}} was being intensively studied. [...] At this point, ribosomes had been implicated in protein synthesis, {{and it had been}} shown that an mRNA strand was necessary for the formation of these structures. [...] In a 1964 publication, Warner and Rich showed that ribosomes active in protein synthesis contained tRNA molecules bound at the A and P sites, and discussed the notion that these molecules aided in the peptidyl transferase reaction. However, despite considerable biochemical characterization, the structural basis of tRNA function remained a mystery. [...] In 1965, Holley et al. purified and sequenced the first tRNA molecule, initially proposing that it adopted a cloverleaf structure, based largely on the ability of certain regions of the molecule to form stem loop structures. The isolation of tRNA proved to be the first major windfall in RNA structural biology. [...] Following Robert W. Holley's publication, numerous investigators began work on isolation tRNA for crystallographic study, developing improved methods for isolating the molecule as they worked. [...] By 1968 several groups had produced tRNA crystals, but these proved to be of limited quality and did not yield data at the resolutions necessary to determine structure. In 1971, Kim et al. achieved <b>another</b> <b>breakthrough,</b> producing crystals of yeast tRNAPHE that diffracted to 2-3 Ångström resolutions by using spermine, a naturally occurring polyamine, which bound to and stabilized the tRNA. [...] Despite having suitable crystals, however, the structure of tRNAPHE was not immediately solved at high resolution; rather it took pioneering work in the use of heavy metal derivatives and a good deal more time to produce a high-quality density map of the entire molecule. [...] In 1973, Kim et al. produced a 4 Ångström map of the tRNA molecule in which they could unambiguously trace the entire backbone. [...] This solution would be followed by many more, as various investigators worked to refine the structure and thereby more thoroughly elucidate the details of base pairing and stacking interactions, and validate the published architecture of the molecule.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} policies of the administration is the launching of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program in June 1988, which involved the acquisition and redistribution of all agricultural lands within a time frame of 10 years. So far, the law has already had numerous accomplishments since it was actually passed. There were setbacks, however, in the overall implementation of this reform program such as the Garchitorena scandal (1989) tainting the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and supposedly exposing inefficiencies in the government bureaucracy. <b>Another</b> important <b>breakthrough</b> involved in the program {{was the fact that the}} program was also seen as a way to address poverty and equity issues.|$|R

Nuon, the Dutch subsidiary of the Swedish company Vattenfall, which owns the Hemwegcentrale, stated to be open for discussion about {{the closure of the}} plant. Essent, the owner of Eemshavencentrale, on the other hand, sought the confrontation; they believed that the closure of the plants would only work counterproductive in reaching the energy goals. Minister Kamp, the minister of Economic Affairs, promised that in the autumn of 2016 a decision will be made by the Dutch government.
