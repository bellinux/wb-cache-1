25|$|LGBT {{movements}} have often adopted {{a kind of}} identity politics that sees gay, bisexual and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a minority group or groups, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> common among LGBT communities. Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity, and aim to join the political mainstream {{on the same level}} as other groups in society. In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian and bisexual people into heterosexuals ("conversion therapy") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in religious beliefs that perceive gay, lesbian and bisexual activity as immoral.|$|E
25|$|Another {{thematic}} source {{may have}} been William Baldwin's The Mirror for Magistrates (1559; 2nd edition, 1578), a well-known series of poems spoken by controversial historical figures who speak {{of their lives and}} deaths, and to warn contemporary society not to make the same mistakes they did. Three such figures are Margaret of Anjou, King Edward IV and Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. York's final scene, and his last speech in particular (1.4.111–171), are often identified as being the 'type' of scene suitable to a traditional tragic hero who has been defeated by his own ambition, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much how York presents himself in Mirror, a tragic hero whose dynastic ambitions caused him to reach too far and led to his ruin.|$|E

Mayor Harvey Nelson explained: [...] "The ad is too much; that's just not true. There's objection that this whole thing will be spreading fear in the community.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

30|$|Compound {{events are}} the {{superposition}} {{of more than}} one type of basic event, for example, specific door locks, where the sound is generated by a mix of impacts, deformations, <b>and</b> scrapings. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> common for most types of events in real world situations.|$|R
30|$|The {{farmers in}} Chakari also obtain natural {{resources}} such as thatch grass, firewood and building materials from the forests which are often {{at the mercy of}} wildland fires. Thirty two percent of the respondents indentified burning of thatch grass and trees in general as the major impact of wildland fires. Wildland fires were also blamed for livestock mortality as they may fail to escape the infernos <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> common especially with young animals (Table  1). The other negative impacts of wildland fires that were highlighted included the destruction of crops in fields, burning of fire wood, injury to forest and destruction of wild fruits and traditional herbs and medicine, and burning of pastures for livestock.|$|R
2500|$|A robust {{simulator}} is {{one that}} will react to any input in a reasonable way. For instance, if we imagine a high speed racecar video game, from one simulation step to the next, {{it is conceivable that}} the cars would advance a substantial distance along the race track. If there is a shallow obstacle on the track (such as a brick wall), it is not entirely unlikely that the car will completely leap over it, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> undesirable. In other instances, the [...] "fixing" [...] that posteriori algorithms require isn't implemented correctly, and characters find themselves embedded in walls, or falling off into a deep void, sometimes referred to as [...] "black hell", [...] "blue hell", or [...] "green hell", depending on the predominant color. These are the hallmarks of a failing collision detection and physical simulation system. [...] is an infamous example of a game with a collision detection system failing, or not being present at all.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Andrews, {{the male}} sitter, {{was a member}} of the landed gentry, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much {{apparent}} in Gainsborough's work. Although it is probable the family money came from being a landlord, Robert's father also lent substantial amounts of money, particularly to other gentry, at significant interest rates. This included the sum of £30,000 to Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1743, for which he became Remembrancer. He had a London house in Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, and also owned ships and engaged in trade with the colonies of the British Empire. Robert himself was born in Bulmer, Essex in 1725, and after attending Sudbury Grammar School at the same time as Gainsborough (two years younger) did, went on to University College, Oxford. His father purchased him an estate, and secured a bride, in a successful attempt to further integrate Robert into the upper classes. In 1763, after his father's death, he would take over the family business. [...] By 1750 he owned almost 3,000 acres, including most of the land visible in the painting.|$|E
2500|$|Liability issues {{strongly}} {{affect the}} structure of the diving industry, its organisation and even the implementation of recommended diving practices – <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much the case with buddy diving. [...] Diving is a risky sport, where very serious accidents will occasionally occur. In an increasingly litigious world, accidents trigger a search for “blame”, and aspersions of blame often trigger ensuing litigation. It is a natural thing for those who may face the potential risks of litigation to take measures to mitigate these risks. [...] Diving certification agencies must necessarily insure themselves against liability risks, and must act to minimise the cost of this insurance for both themselves and their operatives. The buddy system, beneficial as it can be in enhancing diver safety, has the legal effect of [...] creating an involved intermediary person between the certifying agency and any injured party, an intermediary who could be easily identified as not having provided “duty of care” if an accident occurs. [...] This may afford a legal cushion for the agency, or trainer, or boat - but it is not exactly good news for someone acting in the role of a buddy. The more skilled the buddy partner, the more these duties of care may be assumed to increase.|$|E

There is nothing has really so strong a digestion as love, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> lucky, seeing what manifold experiences love has to swallow and assimilate; and when they got back to Venice, Ferris found that the customs of their joint life exorcised all the dark associations of the place. These simply formed a sombre background, against which their wedded happiness relieved itself. They talked much of the past, with free minds, unashamed and unafraid. If it is a little shocking, it is nevertheless true, and true to human nature, that they spoke of Don Ippolito {{as if he were a}} part of their love.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{spoke to}} you just now," [...] he began, [...] "I fell unintentionally into {{the use of}} a Greek word, epitelesei. It was written to me in a letter from a friend with another word that also I am now going to quote to you. This letter touched very closely upon the things I want to say to you now, and so these two words are very much in my mind. The former one was taken from the Epistle to the Philippians; it signifies, 'He will {{complete}} the work begun'; the one I have now in mind comes from the Epistle to the Ephesians; it is Epiphausei--or, to be fuller, epiphausei soi ho Christos, which signifies that He will shine upon us. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much in my thoughts now because I do believe that this world, which seemed so very far from God a little while ago, draws near now to an unexampled dawn.

We can scarcely poke or pry for an hour among the rocks, at low-water mark, or walk, with an observant downcast eye, along the beach after a gale, without finding some oddly-fashioned, suspicious-looking being, unlike any form of life that we have seen before. The dark concealed interior of the sea becomes thus invested with a fresh mystery; its vast recesses appear to be stored with all imaginable forms; and we are tempted to think there must be multitudes of living creatures whose very figure and structure have never yet been suspected.|$|E

6000|$|It may be here {{added that}} I have {{recently}} been informed by Dr. Gilbert [...] "that several square yards on his lawn were swept clean, and {{after two or three}} weeks all the worm-castings on the space were collected and dried.

This is from two to three times as much as we find in our ordinary arable surface-soil; more than in our ordinary pasture surface-soil; but less than in rich kitchen-garden mould. [...] Supposing a quantity of castings equal to 10 tons in the dry state were annually deposited on an acre, this would represent a manuring of 78 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much more than the amount of nitrogen in the annual yield of hay per acre, if raised without any nitrogenous manure.

The other day, besides, he made Austin a musical instrument of the sort they use in his own country--a harp with only one string. He took a stick about three feet long and perhaps four inches round. The under side he hollowed out in a deep trench to serve as sounding-box; the two ends of the upper side he made to curve upward like the ends of a canoe, and between these he stretched the single string. He plays upon it with a match or a little piece of stick, and sings to it songs of his own country, of which no person here can understand a single word, and which are, very likely, all about fighting with his enemies in battle, and killing them, and, I am sorry to say, cooking them in a ground-oven, and eating them for supper when the fight is over.|$|E
60|$|The single-mindedness of the English is beautiful.

But there is something almost caressing in the kindly pause that precedes his perception of your meaning, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> pleasing after the sense of always having your hearer instantly onto you.
