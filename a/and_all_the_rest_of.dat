Logs from thousands of trees boiled over the broken dams, smashed together in a grinding roar and surged on down the current like giant toothpicks tossed by some elemental energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{representations of}} culture in Anatolia were Stone Age artifacts. The remnants of Bronze Age civilizations such as the Hattian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite peoples provide us with many examples of {{the daily lives of}} its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as Greek civilization began to flourish. They, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Anatolia were relatively soon after incorporated into the Achaemenid Persian Empire.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Batiuk {{changed the}} strip's format. It was {{established}} that Funky, Les, Cindy <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the previous cast {{had graduated from}} Westview in 1988; their college years were skipped, and the story continued in their adulthood. Subsequently, the characters started to age in real time and undergo significant life changes. Funky married Cindy in 1998; they are now divorced. Les and Lisa married in a Halloween-themed 1996 story which saw them dressed as Batman and Robin. Funky now co-owned the local pizza parlor with Tony Montoni, Les taught English at Westview, Crazy Harry was the local mailman, Bull was the Scapegoats' coach, and Cindy was a national-level television newscaster. The strip followed their stories {{as well as those}} of a new generation at Westview, including Wally, Becky, Darin and Monroe. Overtly whimsical elements were now downplayed in favor of more grounded real-life incidents and stories, and some of the series' running gags from the 1972–92 years were recast in a more serious light. For instance, Bull's hectoring of Les became the focus of a storyline on domestic violence and child abuse when it was revealed that Bull abused Les to cope with being abused by his own father.|$|E

Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> it, but we didn’t have any script.

500|$|Unlike many games, where {{different}} songs {{have different}} themes for each character or area, Wintory chose to base {{all of the}} pieces on one theme which stood for the player and their journey, with cello solos especially representing the player. Wintory describes the music as [...] "like a big cello concerto where you are the soloist <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the instruments represent the world around you", though he describes it as not necessarily orchestral due to the inclusion of electronic aspects. The cello begins the game as [...] "immersed {{in a sea of}} electronic sound", before first emerging on its own and then merging into a full orchestra, mirroring the player's journey to the mountain. While the game's art style is based on several different cultures, Wintory tried to remove any overt cultural influences from the music to make it [...] "as universal and culture-less as possible". Tina Guo features as the cellist for the soundtrack. She is a close friend of Wintory and has since performed [...] "Woven Variations" [...] with him, an eight-minute orchestral variation on the Journey soundtrack. All of the non-electronic instruments in the soundtrack were recorded with a live orchestra.|$|E

2500|$|The esteem of {{his contemporaries}} for Hilliard is testified to by John Donne, who in a poem called The Storm (1597) praises the work of this artist.

Eight cities were included in the new league: [...] "Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, Newark, New York, and Washington, D.C.".

In 2011, Leguizamo received the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Solo Performance and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for his performance in the show.

On December 14, 1967, Wenner printed an influential article in Rolling Stone that denounced the [...] "genius" [...] label, which he called a [...] "promotional shuck" [...] and an attempt to compare Wilson with the Beatles. He wrote: [...] "Wilson believed [...] and felt obligated to make good of it. It left Wilson in a bind; a bind which meant that a year elapsed between Pet Sounds and their latest release, Smiley Smile. ... The Beach Boys are just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles. It's a pointless pursuit."

2500|$|Some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel {{are still}} {{critical}} of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a [...] "fashionable trend" [...] being promoted due to [...] "sexual hedonism" [...] and broached {{the question of}} whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers. Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the National Organization for Women. Heterosexual feminists such as Betty Friedan downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. She later admitted that [...] "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy" [...] and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. [...] "The women's movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...." [...] She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially but objected to what she saw as demands for equal time. [...] "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'" [...] While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although heterosexual) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution [...] "which everyone thought I would oppose" [...] in order to [...] "preempt any debate" [...] and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

[...] Perceiving that Esau had his eye set on riches, Jacob divided the land of Israel and the Cave of Machpelah in one part <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Isaac’s holdings in the other part. [...] Esau went to consult with Ishmael, as reported in [...] Ishmael told Esau that the Amorite and the Canaanite were in the land, so Esau should take the balance of Isaac’s holdings, and Jacob would have nothing. [...] So Esau took Isaac’s wealth and gave Jacob the land of Israel and the Cave of Machpelah, and they wrote a perpetual deed between them. [...] Jacob then told Esau to leave the land, and Esau took his wives, children, and all that he had, as [...] reports, [...] "And Esau took his wives [...] [...] [...] and all his possessions which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob."
