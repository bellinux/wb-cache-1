Nonradial modes can be divided into p modes, which are stable and pressure-driven, and g modes, which are are gravity driven. The g modes become unstable if the adiabatic exponent is greater than the polytrope index. These modes are analogous to the modes of a spherical star, but their behavior is somewhat different because a cylindrical geometry has less symmetry than a spherical geometry. This implies that perturbations are classified by a radial quantum number, an azimuthal quantum number, and wavelength in the z direction, which can become arbitrarily large.

This work is devoted to test, compare and, if needed, optimize the seismic codes {{used to calculate the}} eigenfrequencies to be finally compared with observations. The oscillation codes of nine research groups in the field have been used in this study. The same physics has been imposed for all the codes in order to isolate the non-physical dependence of any possible difference. Two equilibrium models with different grids, 2172 and 4042 mesh points, have been used, and the latter model includes an explicit modelling of semiconvection just outside the convective core. Comparing the results for these two models illustrates the effect of the number of mesh points and their distribution in particularly critical parts of the model, such as the steep composition gradient outside the convective core. A comprehensive study of the frequency differences found for the different codes is given as well. These differences are mainly due to the use of different numerical integration schemes. The use of a second-order integration scheme plus a Richardson extrapolation provides similar results to a fourth-order integration scheme. The proper numerical description of the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the equilibrium model is also critical for some modes. An unexpected result of this study is the high sensitivity of the frequency differences to the inconsistent use of values of the gravitational constant (G) in the oscillation codes, within the range of the experimentally determined ones, which differ from the value used to compute the equilibrium model.

40|$|Context. The APOGEE survey has {{obtained}} high-resolution infrared spectra {{of more than}} 100, 000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of these stars is paramount to piecing together {{the structure of the}} Milky Way. While the derived chemical abundances {{have been shown to be}} precise for most stars, some calibration problems have been reported, in particular for more metal- poor stars. Aims. In this paper, we aim to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances of the APOGEE+Kepler stellar sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure, line list and line selection, and high quality surface gravity information from <b>astroseismology,</b> and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including abundances that are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE release (DR 12). Methods. We fixed the Teff and log g to those determined using spectrophotometric and asteroseismic techniques, respectively. We made use of the Brussels Automatic Stellar Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the metallicity and broadening parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we derived differential abundances with respect to Arcturus. Results. We have validated the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and stars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, P, Cr, Co, Cu, Rb, Yb and V for every star, line, and show the impact of line selection on the final abundances. These include abundances of five new elements and improved abundances for Si, Ti, S, and V. Conclusions. In this paper, we present an independent analysis of the APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21 elements. This catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance patterns of the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which can improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full APOGEE sample.
