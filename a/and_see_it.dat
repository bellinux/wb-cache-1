5|$|In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine. When Negus {{had been}} {{training}} as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology {{had been part of}} general surgery, but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons. Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was {{also a member of the}} college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma. This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the National Health Service (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS.|$|E

The first four episodes of What's My Line also originated from Grand Central before the show moved to various Manhattan theaters that could accommodate studio audiences. In 1964, CBS moved television operations to the CBS Broadcast Center.|$|E

The bill to create the agency passed in December 2011, nine months after the disaster occurred, delaying {{the opening of the}} agency until February 2012. Kan acknowledged the slow pace of government response to the disaster on March 3, 2011, and pledged to speed up recovery efforts. Residents displaced by the tsunami have opposed Agency-led plans to rebuild towns on higher land away from the coast, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as a disconnect between the central government and the population in the Tōhoku region. After a strict review of initial projects, the Agency approved a large number of projects in a second round of reviews in May 2012, including funds for urban and agricultural renewal.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, for {{the highest}} level of college football, there were only five bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Sun, and Cotton). By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable {{television}} and cable sports networks like ESPN, there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2008, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule. [...] Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game. Yet others have countered that the increased number of games has increased exposure and revenue for a greater number of schools, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as a positive development.|$|E

Decades later Eddy wrote that, on the third day after the fall, she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage. In several editions of Science and Health she {{identified}} it as Mark 3, but later said that it had been Matthew 9:2–8, a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum: [...] "As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed." [...] The physician who treated her at the time, Alvin M. Cushing, swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one, and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy; she had not said anything to him about a miraculous healing.|$|E
500|$|Seward {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} {{about the man who}} had blocked him from the presidency. One story is that when Seward was told that to deny Carl Schurz an office would disappoint him, Seward angrily stated, [...] "Disappointment! [...] You speak of me of disappointment! [...] To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> given to a little Illinois lawyer!" [...] Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. [...] Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, [...] "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President is the best of us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation." [...] According to Goodwin, [...] "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." [...] Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.|$|E
500|$|Although {{originally}} intended as an unambiguous ending {{to the television}} series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over {{the possibility of a}} sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that [...] "if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed." [...] Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted [...] "we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go back <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> more than once – and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.|$|E

2500|$|The freshly staffed VF-6 [...] "Shooting Stars" [...] {{would see}} action <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> fast.

It would support the U.S. Navy's first true counter-offensive and amphibious assault in the Pacific Ocean Theater, inaugurating the {{fighting}} at Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. TF 61 arrived at Guadalcanal undetected and ahead of Japanese expectations. As a result, Japanese materiel such as planes for the newly constructed runways had yet to arrive, and Japanese defenses were neither manned nor even fully operational. When Saratoga and Enterprises air groups began their runs on Red Beach in the pre-dawn hours they were virtually unopposed. The Japanese air response was coming in fast, though: the 5th Air Attack Force scrapped plans to attack the Allied airfield at Rabi and instead launched straightaway for Guadalcanal. Veteran Japanese aces like Hiroyoshi Nishizawa and Saburō Sakai of the Tainan Air Group would soon bear down on Vorse and company.|$|E

Having seen The Terminator {{when she was a}} teenager, which [...] "scared the hell out of" [...] her, Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character and in regards to Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the role in the film series, she remarked, [...] "Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it's a very strong print that she's left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> with fresh eyes". When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said [...] "I'm playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. And the way I would play that is someone who's passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So I approach that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her". However, the choice to cast Headey was criticized by several fans and critics who argued that she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular woman established by Hamilton, who transformed her body into that of a muscled warrior for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The controversy was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Herald, and The Guardian, as well as in online forums.|$|E
