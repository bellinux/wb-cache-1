Her real-life counterpart, Jaeha, reappears in volume 6, mildly surprised to see 'herself' on television. She is revealed to have feelings for Roto, always protecting him. When she was erased, he learned of her history. Yureka name in the real world is Jaeha. Jaeha was a skilled hacker that worked as a [...] "killer", a person on the net that attacked corrupt politicians or businessman, putting them in a coma-like state. It turns out Jaeha's parents were tricked by such people, causing them to commit suicide and attempt to kill her as well. She wanted to become a [...] "killer" [...] to gain revenge on that man. After losing her card, she found that Yureka existed and watched her and Roto as entertainment. As time progressed, she focused more and more on Yureka's life, interfering with her job, making her partner Elca angry. They later realized that Roto was learning too much of Yureka's programming, so they decided to separate them, causing Jaeha to kill Yureka. But it was too late, as Jaeha was in love with Roto, and was jealous of Yureka's relationship with him. Later when Yureka was revived, Yureka and Jaeha share the same body, but their separate psyches create conflict, as they both love Roto <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved by him.

There were a lot of times that they'd call cut and I'd say to Anna, 'I'm so sorry! It's not my fault!'. However she acknowledged 6 months of marriage on the show was seemingly the equivalent of 10 years in real life terms. Jay's affair was with her boss Dylan, in an attempt to further her career.
