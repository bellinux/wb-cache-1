40|$|Level of Food Preference of Bawean Deer (<b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii)</b> on Food Species in Wildlife Sanctuary and Nature Reserve of Bawean Island This {{research}} has a {{background on the}} importance of food preference of Rusa Bawean (<b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii).</b> This information can be used to ensure the adequacy of preferred food availability within their habitat. This paper aimed to estimate food preference of Rusa Bawean employing faecal analysis. The technique was selected because it is safe for the animal and is easy in data analysis and interpretation. To achieve the aim, quasi experimental design was applied to 30 vegetation plots and 60 faecal samples. Data was collected during January 2005 and June 2006 in the area of Wildlife Sanctuary and Nature Reserve of Bawean Island. Data was analyzed with chi-square test and food selection index. Result shows Rusa Bawean have preferences on some of food species, and they do not select their food species randomly according to its abundance.   Preferred food species include Kabak-kabakan alas (Brachiaria distachya), Talioar (Panicum cordayum), Gadung (Dioscorea hispida), Andudur (Caryota mitis), Rombok putih (Merremia peltata), Pele (Urena lobata) and Kabak-kabakan merah (Ischaemum timorense). Whereas avoided food species include Lating-latingan (Scleria hebecarpa), Ancucu (Pericampylus glaucus), Lambu Merah (Paspalum conjugatum), Alang-alang (Imperata cylindrica), Padi-padian (Centotheca lappacea), Lente-lentean (Fimbristylis dichotoma), Taliata (Lygodium circinnatum) dan Kayu sape (Symplocos adenophylla) ...|$|R

40|$|Conservation of rare {{ungulates}} requires reliable {{population size}} estimates and distribution maps for prioritizing investments and assessing {{the effectiveness of}} conservation measures. We used both camera trapping and a random encounter model approach, and faecal pellet group counts, to update the range and population size of the Bawean deer <b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii</b> in the Bawean Island Nature Reserve and Wildlife Sanctuary, Indonesia. We studied 2 -month periods to fulfil the assumption of population closure. Both methods provided similar population density estimates (higher in the dry season) of c. 227 – 416 individuals. The estimated range of the species is significantly narrower than previously reported. The main threats (habitat loss {{as a result of}} illegal logging, and disturbance by dogs and hunters) are ongoing. Based on these results we suggest that the species should retain its Critically Endangered status on the IUCN Red List...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{being one}} of the rarest deer in the world, the {{critically}} endangered Bawean deer <b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii</b> has received little conservation attention. Fauna monitoring is usually limited by lack of resource; therefore, the choice of a relevant methodology is fundamental to maximize the cost-benefit ratio. We compared the performance and cost of three direct and indirect methods to survey Bawean deer in protected areas of Bawean Island. Camera trapping provided a high number of records of Bawean deer (118 for 5500 camera days) and ascertained identifications of several other species. The number of photographs increased with the dry season. Transect sampling was time-consuming in the field for a poor result (two records for 19. 200 h). Faecal pellet group count was more successful (80 pellet groups for 9. 600 h of fieldwork). Camera traps are expensive to buy, but they lighten the field work and provide much data for further analyses...|$|R

Information on the calving pattern in nonexistence {{and there is}} a need to {{understand}} more on their reproduction physiology for conservation purposes. Recors on the calving from Bawean Deer and others tropical deer (Cervus timorensis and Cervus unicolor) from Surabaya zoo were compared. The data were obtained from 1989 to 1996 calving time. The result showed that the mean calcing date for Bawean deer is July 14 th (SE = 8. 3 days, n = 130), Timorensis eer being may 25 th (SE = 11. 0 days, n = 74), and Sambar deer being Juny 16 th (SE = 26. 2 days, n = 13). The calving time Bawean deer are spread equally between months, whereas Timorensis and Sambar deer tended to have a peak calving time with Timorensis Deer in July. Due to a small of calving record in Sambar deer, no conclusive result can be gathered. ...|$|R

In this island {{it is known}} to habituate an endemic deer called Bawean deer (<b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii</b> Mull. Et. Schleg). The animal is protected both nationally and Internationally. Understanding the forest as the habitat for this deer {{is an important step}} toward the management and the development of the whole habitat. This study was conducted on September 2001 in three locations, known to be the habitat for Bawean deer, that was the Kumalasa, Patarselamat and Pudakit Barat villages. The forest type at study sites was lowland secondary forest. There were 114 species from 90 genus and 56 families. Number of species and trees density at Audacity Barat villages are bigger than Patarselamat or Kumalasa villages. In all study sites, Syzygium lepidocarpa, Irvingia malayana, Garcinia dioica, and Microcos tomentosa are common species. Trees height in three location were under 25 m tall, and stem diameter class were highest among 10 - 20 cm. Species richness (Ss) ranged from 22, 7 to 55, 7 %.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} {{recognized}} need for conservation of tropical forest deer. In {{order to identify}} some environmental factors affecting conservation, we analyzed the seasonal habitat use of two Indonesian deer species, <b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii</b> in Bawean Island and Muntiacus muntjak in south-western Java Island, in response to several physical, climatic, biological, and anthropogenic variables. Camera trapping was performed in different habitat types during both wet and dry season to record these elusive species. The highest number of photographs was recorded in secondary forest and {{during the dry season}} for both Bawean deer and red muntjac. In models, anthropogenic and climatic variables were the main predictors of habitat use. Distances to cultivated area and to settlement were the most important for A. kuhlii in the dry season. Distances to cultivated area and annual rainfall were significant for M. muntjak in both seasons. Then we modelled their predictive range using Maximum entropy modelling (Maxent). We concluded that forest landscape is the fundamental scale for deer management, and that secondary forests are potentially important landscape elements for deer conservation. Important areas for conservation were identified accounting of habitat transformation in both study areas...|$|R

40|$|Abundance and Diversity of Bawean Deer Foods in Bawean Wildlife Sanctuary,Bawean Island,East Java Bawean deer (<b>Axis</b> <b>kuhlii)</b> is an {{endemic species}} to Bawean. Habitat change and loss, land conversion, and over {{exploitation}} affect {{the availability of}} potential food forBawean deer. The aims of this research were to identifi  types ofpotential food for Bawean deer in Bawean Wildlife Sanctuary, the abundance ofpotential foods in Bawean Wildlife Sanctuary and the diversity of such potential foods. Data collected using line transects whose length was adjusted according to field condition. The line transects were located in parallel to natural trail of study area. Observation {{was done in the}} plots established along transect, where plant being eaten by Bawean deer was found. Plot has a circular form with diameter of 3. 14 m. Distance between plots was determined to be 100 m. Indicators used to collect data were feces, footprint and bite or chew mark on food plants. Identification ofplant species was conducted directly for every plant which showed bite or chew mark Data concerning type ofplant and its number, part of plants which was bitten or chewed and plant height were recorded. Abundance will be determined from the number of potential foods in each location. The results were afterwards compared among three forest regions. The diversity of food plant species was determined using Shannon index. The result showed that there are 29 plants considered as potential food for Bawean deer. Most of the plants are grasses, and herbs, while woody plants are found in a small number. Leaves, shoots (buds) and fruits are part of plant often being eaten. There are 14 food plants occurred in Gunung Mas forest region, 27 food plants were found in Gunung Besar forest region and 13 food plants in Tanjung Cina Island. Taliata, rumput padang and gadung have high abundance in Gunung Mas forest region, the smallest abundance was occupied by kayu flat. Kabek-kabekan putih, lading-ladingan and taliata showed the highest abundance in Gunung Besar forest region, while karangsang has the lowest abundance. In Tanjung Cina Island, high abundance was dominated by gadung, taliowar and lading-ladingan. On the other hand, talicacing, kayu tekek and rombok putih showed low abundance.

40|$|The present {{series of}} studies was {{designed}} to investigate the expression, regulation, and extent of maternal investment in a cooperatively breeding primate, Wied 2 ̆ 7 s black tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix <b>kuhlii).</b> First, <b>I</b> examined the possibility that marmoset females might be sensitive to litter-to-litter changes in the immediate energetic demands of reproduction and that they might make tradeoffs between current versus future offspring by reducing investment in their current litters. As reported for other callitrichid primates, C. kuhlii females reduced their investment in offspring across the postpartum period. However, the magnitude and timing of this reduction varied {{as a function of}} females 2 ̆ 7 ability to delegate the care of their infants to other family members, and {{as a function of the}} timing of the postpartum conception. Second, I assessed the relationship between hormonal factors and litter-to-litter variation in patterns of maternal investment. When females had experienced alloparents to assist them with the rearing of offspring, they had significantly lower levels of urinary cortisol during the pre- and postpartum period than when they only had assistance from their male partners. However, urinary cortisol was not correlated with postpartum carrying effort. When females conceived during the early postpartum period, they had significantly higher postpartum urinary estradiol levels than when they conceived later in the postpartum period. Postpartum estradiol was significantly and negatively correlated with infant carrying effort. Third, I observed maternal behavior during the nighttime hours to determine whether disrupted sleep is associated with parent-infant co-sleeping in marmosets. Females caring for newborns were awake more than twice as often as females without infants. Furthermore, breeding females exhibited more nighttime wakefulness than their male partners across the first nine weeks of infant life. The results of these studies indicated that the expression of maternal investment in marmosets is more flexible than previously reported, and that the costs of rearing callitrichid infants may be even more costly than previously recognized. ...|$|R
