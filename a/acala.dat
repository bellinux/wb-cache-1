5|$|In 1555 Spanish friar Domingo de Vico {{offended}} a local Ch'ol ruler and {{was killed}} by the <b>Acala</b> Ch'ol and their Lakandon allies. In response to the killing, a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q'eqchi' leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q'eqchi' expedition were taken back to Cobán and resettled in Santo Tomás Apóstol.|$|E
5|$|Sizeable Maya populations {{existed in}} Petén before the conquest, {{particularly}} around the central lakes {{and along the}} rivers. Petén was divided into different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the Yalain and the Kowoj. Other groups with territories in Petén included the Kejache, the <b>Acala,</b> the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Xocmo, the Chinamita, the Icaiche and the Manche Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} Luis Marín's {{reconnaissance}} expedition, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when he crossed {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with Hernán Cortés' expedition heading for Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the <b>Acala</b> Ch'ol; he was unable to locate Cortés, and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch'ol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After failing to locate Cortés, the Alvarados returned to Guatemala.|$|E

40|$|Nine {{short staple}} cotton {{varieties}} including five New Mexico <b>acalas,</b> four California <b>acalas</b> {{were tested in}} the 1994 variety study. The highest yielding variety was 1517 - 91 with a lint yield of 1009 pounds per acre. The average yield was nearly 200 pounds per acre higher than the previous three years. In addition to lint yields; percent lint, plant heights, height to node ratios and plant populations are shown. A lint yield comparison for 1991, 1993 and 1994 is included in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Two {{short staple}} variety trials and 1 long staple variety trial were {{harvested}} in Greenlee county in 1988. In the short staple trial comparing {{the new and}} experimental New Mexico <b>acalas</b> with 2 other lower quality varieties, Genhains new GC 260 was the top yielding variety with 1, 087 pounds of lint per acre, but it came in fifth when comparing dollar value per acre because of the premium structure for the New Mexico <b>acalas.</b> Two new experimental <b>acalas,</b> 2745 and B 510, produced the highest income per acre. The short staple trial, which tested longer - season varieties, had problems with low micronaire values. The newly released 1517 - 88 variety produced the top yield and produced the most income per acre. Two of the experimental long staple varieties topped the yield of S- 6 and 3 of the 7 varieties tested yielded over 650 pounds of lint per acre...|$|R
5|$|A year later, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when {{he crossed}} {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with an {{expedition}} headed by Hernán Cortés, that crossed from the Gulf of Mexico to Honduras.

5|$|A broad swathe {{of western}} Chiapas {{was held by}} the Zoques, {{covering}} the Depresión Central, the middle Grijalva basin, the Chimalapas {{and parts of the}} Pacific coastline. The main Zoque settlements in the Depresión Central were Copainalá, Mezcalapa, Quechula and Tecapatán. Their settlements on the western side of the Grijalva River included Citalapa, Jiquipilas, Ocozocuautla and the Corzos valley. Coyatocmó was a small Zoque settlement that grew into the modern state capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The Aztecs exacted tribute from the Zoques, and dominated trade routes running through their territory. In pre-Columbian times, the Depresión Central featured two of the largest cities in the region, Chiapa and Copanaguastla. The area around Chiapa de Corzo was occupied by the Chiapanecas, whose ethnicity and language are unknown. The Chiapanecas were militarily powerful before the Spanish conquest; they had forced a number of important Zoque settlements to pay them tribute, and had successfully resisted being incorporated into the Aztec Empire. The Chiapaneca territory lay between the territories of the Zoques and the Tzotzil Maya, in the upper and middle Grijalva basin; their main settlements were <b>Acala,</b> Chiapa, Ostuta, Pochutla and Suchiapa.|$|E
5|$|In 1543 the new colonial reducción of Santo Domingo de Cobán {{was founded}} at Chi Mon'a {{to house the}} {{relocated}} Q'eqchi' from Chichen, Xucaneb and Al Run Tax Aj. Santo Tomás Apóstol was founded nearby the same year at Chi Nim Xol, it was used in 1560 as a reducción to resettle Ch'ol communities from Topiltepeque and Lacandon in the Usumacinta Valley. In 1555 the <b>Acala</b> Ch'ol and their Lacandon allies killed the Spanish friar Domingo de Vico. De Vico had established a small church among the inhabitants of San Marcos, a region that lay between the territories of the Lacandon and the Manche Ch'ol (an area unrelated {{to the department of}} San Marcos). De Vico had offended the local ruler by repeatedly scolding him for taking several wives. The indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then seized him, cut open his chest and extracted his heart. His corpse was then decapitated; the natives carried off his head, which was never recovered by the Spanish. In response a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q'eqchi' leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q'eqchi' expedition were taken back to Cobán and resettled in Santo Tomás Apóstol.|$|E
40|$|Ten {{short staple}} cotton {{varieties}} including two New Mexico <b>acalas</b> varieties and one advanced strain, four California <b>acalas</b> and three Australian upland varieties {{were tested in}} the 1996 variety study. The Australian variety IF 1001 had the highest lint yield with a yield of 1013 pounds per acre, followed by the New Mexico advances strain. The average yield was more than 100 pounds per acre lower than the previous year, due to an early frost. In addition to lint yields; percent lint, plant heights, height to node ratios, plant populations and lint hvi values are shown. A lint yield comparison for 1993 through 1996 is included in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{varieties}} {{were tested}} including two New Mexico <b>Acalas,</b> two California <b>Acalas</b> from CPCSD, the new Arizona Cotton Grower’s variety and seven other upland varieties. Among the twelve varieties, eight contained the roundup resistant gene, {{which is very}} important for the high elevation trials. Four of these roundup resistant varieties were stacked gene varieties also containing the Bollgard trait. The highest yielding variety in the trial was 1517 - 99, with a yield approaching 800 pounds of lint per acre. This yield was lower than seen in 2001. In addition to the plant mapping data and HVI data which are provided, estimates of the crop values are also included in this report...|$|R
40|$|Variety {{trials were}} grown at two {{locations}} and with two {{different sets of}} short staple varieties. One trial on the Robbs farm, north of Kansas Settlement, tested eight <b>acalas</b> varieties from New Mexico and California. The other trial on the Curry farm, southwest of Kansas Settlement and north of Sunsites, tested twelve upland varieties {{as part of the}} statewide testing program. The latter trial was grown under drip irrigation...|$|R
25|$|In Japan, <b>Acala</b> {{is highly}} venerated in the Shingon Buddhism, Tendai, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism and in Shugendō. Fudō Myō-ō is also highly revered amongst some Yakuza members, who oftentimes draw on his intense facial {{expression}} and demeanor.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, <b>Acala</b> {{became an}} idol of worship {{in its own}} right, and became {{installed}} as the honzon (本尊) or main deity at temples and outdoor shrines. A famous example is the Narita Fudō-dō, a Shingon subsect temple at Narita-san.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acala</b> in Buddhist art {{since the}} Heian period has {{depicted}} him as angry-faced, holding a vajra sword and a lariat.

40|$|High Volume Instrument (HVI) {{classing}} {{of eighteen}} cotton varieties grown at several elevations in southeastern Arizona are compared by location in this paper. Data presented herein {{would indicate that}} elevation does not affect fiber length nor strength, these factors are more a function of variety and management. Micronaire values were seen to be lower at the higher elevations and this was felt to {{be a function of}} lower maturity level because of reduced growing season coupled with production of fine fibered New Mexico <b>acalas.</b> This report also contains HVI values on lint from 47 varieties of short staple cotton grown on the Safford Agricultural Center during the 1989 season...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{played a}} major part in the {{production}} of cotton in the Safford valley in 1991. A cool spring and early summer slowed the development of cotton and gave an advantage to varieties that could produce quickly in the warm late summer months. Three Stoneville varieties came {{to the top of the}} test with Stoneville 506 producing the highest yield of over 4000 pounds of seed cotton per acre. The New Mexico <b>acalas,</b> 1517 - 91 and 1517 - 88 also produced well, and depending on the premium, could produce more income per acre than the top varieties. Fifteen varieties were tested at this site and all produced over 2 bales per acre...|$|R
50|$|For {{a number}} of reasons, the Purépecha origins are {{shrouded}} in mystery. Much of Purépecha culture is very distinct from other Mesoamerican cultures. The Purépecha language has {{more in common with}} Zuni in the southwest U.S. and Quechua in Peru and is unrelated to any other Mesoamerican language. Jeromimo de <b>Acalá’s</b> collection of stories from Purépecha elders states that these people migrated to the Lake Pátzcuaro region, developing alliances among the people who were already here. Eventually, they became the dominant group and established their city at Tzintzuntzan. According to collected evidence, the Purépecha people may have begun to dominate the Pátzcuaro Lake area as early as 1000 C.E., but definitely by 1250.|$|R
25|$|According to legend, {{the image}} of <b>Acala</b> became too heavy after the victory {{to move back to}} its home base, so a new temple on Narita-san, named Shinshō-ji (New Victory Temple), was built to enshrine it on the spot. The temple {{maintains}} that the original image is enshrined in the Main Hall, where it is displayed on special occasions, but art historians date the current image to no earlier than the 13th century.|$|E
500|$|The three inner chapels, sequentially, are the Jampa Lhakhang, the Neten Lhakhang and Jigje Lhakhang. A [...] high {{image of}} Maitreya was deified in Jampa Lhakhang ensconced by Eight Bodhisattvas, the treasured Kagyur and guarded by Hayagriva and <b>Acala</b> at the entrance. Jigje Lhakhang houses {{the image of}} Bhairava with his consort and Shridevi and other {{protector}} deities.|$|E
500|$|Records {{indicate}} Kita {{was rated}} highly in teahouse rankings, and that curious fans flooded her father's teahouse; {{it is said}} this caused her to become arrogant and cease to serve tea unless called for. [...] Hisa ranked lower, though still {{appears to have been}} quite popular—a wealthy merchant offered 1500 [...] for her, but her parents refused and she continued to work at the teahouse. [...] Utamaro took advantage of this rivalry in his art, going as far as to portray the two tearoom beauties in tug-of-war and other competitions, with deities associated with their neighbourhoods supporting them: Buddhist guardian deity <b>Acala</b> was associated with Yagenbori, and supported Hisa; Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, was associated with the temple Sensō-ji in Asakusa, and supported Kita.|$|E
40|$|Forty four {{short staple}} {{varieties}} and Pima S- 6 were grown in a replicated trial on the Safford Agricultural Center in Graham county. Most of the varieties were commercially {{available in the}} cotton belt, however, a few experimental varieties from the New Mexico <b>acalas,</b> ChemBred and from Delta Pines were included. Seventeen varieties produced more than 4000 pounds of seed cotton per acre with the top variety, BR 110, yielding 4921 pounds per acre. The second variety, HS Sal 10, is a new variety developed by Bill Salmons. 1990 contained some record breaking high temperatures {{in the month of}} June which were detrimental to yields {{in other parts of the}} state.

Yields were 15 to 30 % lower than the yields in this trial in 1990, with only one variety producing more than 4000 pounds of seed cotton per acre. The top variety was CB (ChemBred) 407 with a yield of 4177 pounds per acre. HS Sal 10, which was number two last year, retained that position in 1991. Newcomers to the top ten were: S 1001, HS 46, CBX 1210, DP 5690, STV 506 and DP 5415.

500|$|The Manche Ch'ol {{inhabited}} the southern Petén Basin, southern Belize, {{and the area}} around Lake Izabal. Their territory consisted of tropical rainforest upon a low-lying limestone plain, crossed by fast-flowing rivers. It also featured small areas of savannah and extensive swamps. The Manche Ch'ol occupied a frontier region between the jurisdictions of the Spanish colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala. The Manche Ch'ol had frequent contact with the inhabitants of Cahabón, to the southwest, which continued after Cahabón was incorporated into the Spanish Empire. The Manche Ch'ol were bordered to the north by the Mopan Maya and to the west by the <b>Acala</b> Maya, who were probably another Ch'ol-speaking group. Further west were the Lakandon Ch'ol, occupying land around the tributaries of the upper Usumacinta River. To the northwest of the Manche Ch'ol were the Itza, with their territory centered upon their island capital of Nojpetén, upon Lake Petén Itzá. To the east, the Manche Ch'ol bordered the Caribbean Sea, and in the 17th century Dominican friar Joseph Delgado mentioned that the Manche Ch'ol had settlements scattered along the Caribbean coast almost {{as far north as}} Bacalar, now within the borders of Quintana Roo state in southeastern Mexico. Settlements on the Caribbean coast in the early 17th century included Yaxhal, Paliac, Campin and Tzoite. There were further towns in the Cancuén River drainage, including Manche (renamed San Miguel Manché by the Spanish), Chocahau, Yaxha (colonial San Pablo Yaxhá) and Yol (colonial Santo Domingo Yol). The closest Manche town to colonial Verapaz was Tzalac (referred to as San Lucas Salac by the Spanish), [...] from Cahabón. This was a large Manche settlement on the Sarstoon River, close to the Gracias a Díos rapids.|$|E
