5|$|With the {{publication}} of Chariots of the Gods? in 1968, Erich von Däniken introduced the intervention theory to the general public. Von Däniken wrote that the technologies and religions of ancient civilizations were granted by extraterrestrials worshiped as gods. Von Däniken argued that only extraterrestrial intervention can explain the higher technological knowledge presumed to be essential {{for the production of}} ancient artifacts such as the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge and the Moai of Easter Island. Humans in ancient times considered this extraterrestrial high-tech to be supernatural and the aliens themselves to be 'gods'. One can find direct parallels to the messages that Vorilhon claimed to have received and written <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> books. Marie-Hélène Parent, ex-guide Raëlian priest, describes Sendy and Vorilhon meeting several times for drinks and conversation throughout the years of 1973 and 1974, prior to Vorilhon's claimed extraterrestrial encounter.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> weekly column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E

25|$|Also {{strongly}} {{critical of}} reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained {{to the contrary}} that mind {{is the reality of}} which we are in fact most certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes <b>about,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E

Wagner, who was 22, and Stanwyck, who was 45 at the {{beginning}} of the relationship, had a four-year romance, which is described in Wagner's memoir Pieces of My Heart (2008). Stanwyck ended the relationship. In the 1950s, Stanwyck reportedly also had a one-night stand with the much younger Farley Granger, which he wrote <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography Include Me Out: My Life from Goldwyn to Broadway (2007).|$|E

In addition, he gathered information on many more areas that he heard <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> travels, including China and Tibet.

The Bud Leavitt Show debuted that year as one of the first local programs on the air in Maine. For the next 20 years Leavitt appeared every Saturday night to talk about the pressing issues of a Maine outdoorsman: how to remove a fishhook; the death of a favorite dog; snoeshowing and moose hunting and salmon fishing.|$|E

500|$|The diary {{has been}} praised for its {{literary}} merits. Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist Meyer Levin commended Frank for [...] "sustaining {{the tension of}} a well-constructed novel", and was so impressed {{by the quality of}} her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication. Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography The Obsession. The poet John Berryman called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the [...] "conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty".|$|E
500|$|King George was {{extremely}} devoted to Octavius, who {{was too young}} to cause the kinds of trouble that his elder brothers were by the year of his birth. The king was affectionate and indulgent with his young children, and strove to attend their birthday parties and other events organized for their merriment; on one occasion a friend witnessed a happy domestic scene that involved George [...] "carrying <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms by turns Sophia and the last prince, Octavius." [...] Another witness wrote George and Charlotte [...] "have their Children always playing about them the whole time"; during most evenings the children were brought to their parents between 6 and 7 O'clock to play for an hour or two. The king also was kept informed of his children's educational progress.|$|E
500|$|Flann's reign {{began with}} a demand for hostages from the kings of Leinster. In 881, he led an army of Irishmen and [...] "Foreigners" [...] into the north, attacking Armagh. Unlike the later poetic {{accounts}} which made the Gaels and the [...] "Foreigners" [...] bitterest enemies, and recast events as a struggle between natives and incomers, Irish kings generally had no qualms about allying themselves with the [...] "Foreigners" [...] when convenient. It is likely that one of Flann's sisters {{was married to a}} Norse or Norse-Gael leader. Gerald of Wales offers a typically inventive account of how this marriage came <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Topographia Hibernica. Gerald claimed that Máel Sechnaill had granted his daughter to the Viking chieftain called Turgesius, and he had sent fifteen beardless young men, disguised as the bride's handmaidens, to kill the chieftain and his closest associates.|$|E

[...] Following this, Walter Jackson Bate, in 1963, claimed that [...] " [...] each generation {{has found it}} one of the most nearly perfect poems in English." [...] Later, in 1973, Stuart Sperry wrote, To Autumn' succeeds through its acceptance of an order innate in our experience [...] the natural rhythm of the seasons. It is a poem that, without ever stating it, inevitably suggests the truth of 'ripeness is all' by developing, with a richness of profundity of implication, the simple perception that ripeness is fall." [...] In 1981, William Walsh argued that [...] "Among the major Odes [...] no one has questioned the place and supremacy of 'To Autumn', in which we see wholly realized, powerfully embodied in art, the complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in Keats's life, so persuasively argued <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letters." [...] Literary critic and academic Helen Vendler, in 1988, declared that [...] "in the ode 'To Autumn,' Keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for the social value of art." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of sustaining Nancy as a Ligue 1 club was difficult as Wenger inherited {{a squad of}} sub-standard quality and he was given limited money to spend. He nevertheless relished the prospect of conducting business in the transfer market, and enjoyed freedom to trial theories he read <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> first season at Nancy, Wenger hired a dietician to explain the benefits of healthy eating and made it imperative that players did not snack before games. He took the squad away from their usual summer training camp to Val Thorens, so that the players could acclimatise to the high-altitude. Platini attested the move to their strong league starts. From a managerial perspective, Wenger struggled to keep his emotions in check; losing made him [...] "physically sick", {{to the point where}} he once stopped the team bus to vomit after a game. Wenger guided the club to a respectable 12th-place finish, all the more surprising given he constantly tinkered his team. Players were moved out of their favoured positions, which for some maximised their potential. Éric Bertrand, a striker signed from the lower divisions, was converted into a fullback, and by the end of Wenger's time at Nancy, Éric Di Meco switched from a left winger to wing back.|$|E

Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other." [...] Additionally, Waldman wrote: [...] "Braeden's {{contribution}} to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated. He's been a driving force as Victor primarily because he's a villain who's not quite pure evil. He has a heart and on occasion shows a vulnerability that makes him likable and even sympathetic" [...] but [...] "like a big jungle cat, he is not one to be tamed. That's why at any point, Victor can turn on someone he once professed to love [...] See, that's Victor. He makes viewers crazy with his actions, but he's so dynamic and interesting, that you can't stop watching him. Thank you, Eric Braeden. You are Victor and you have made him completely compelling for 30 years." [...] In another article, Waldman called Braeden {{one of the biggest}} stars in the soap opera business. Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes [...] "The Mustache" [...] and [...] "The Dark Night". When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), {{for the first time since}} he was seven years old.
