5|$|Bo Xilai's {{political}} fortunes came to <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> {{end when}} his police chief, Wang Lijun, {{fled to the}} American consulate in Chengdu hoping to gain political asylum. Wang reportedly provided the consulate with information on Bo's alleged misconduct, including his role obstructing investigations into the homicide of British citizen and Bo family associate Neil Heywood.

5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{campaign}} {{brought the}} prosperity and independence of Khazaria to <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end. The destruction of Khazar imperial power {{paved the way}} for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E

5|$|The {{idealization}} of Tamar {{was further}} accentuated {{by the events}} that took place under her immediate successors; within two decades of Tamar's death, the Khwarezmian and Mongol invasions brought Georgian ascendancy to <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end. Later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match the achievements of Tamar's reign. All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred {{the distinction between the}} idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E

5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity came to <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed {{after the end of the}} Swedish Wars.

5|$|Having first {{established}} {{themselves in}} the West Coast third wave ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released {{at the onset of}} the late 1990s swing revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> hiatus in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1244, Alexander {{made the}} first of several {{attempts}} by Scottish monarchs to purchase the Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's expulsion from the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a full-scale summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end to his westward invasion, and {{it was not until the}} 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model for the}} electric field distribution of positively beveled abrupt p-n junctions is presented.
