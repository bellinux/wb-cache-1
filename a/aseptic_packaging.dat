High-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging),</b> it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.|$|E
2500|$|Finland, where {{approximately}} 17% of the Finnish-speaking {{population has}} hypolactasia, has had [...] "HYLA" [...] (acronym for hydrolysed lactose) products available for many years. Lactose of low-lactose level cow's milk products, ranging from ice cream to cheese, is enzymatically hydrolysed into glucose and galactose. The ultra-pasteurization process, combined with <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging,</b> ensures a long shelf life. In 2001, Valio launched a lactose-free milk drink {{that is not}} sweet like HYLA milk but has the fresh taste of ordinary milk. Valio patented the chromatographic separation method to remove lactose. Valio also markets these products in Sweden, Estonia, Belgium, and the United States, where the company says ultrafiltration is used.|$|E
5000|$|Bag-in-box is {{also used}} {{extensively}} in the packaging of processed fruit and dairy products in aseptic processes. Using <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging</b> equipment, products can be packed in <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging.</b> Pasteurised or UHT treated products packed into this format can be [...] "shelf stable", requiring no refrigeration. Some products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years, {{depending on the type}} of bag that is used.|$|E
5000|$|Aseptic {{containers}} are recycled with {{a method}} called hydrapulping. Some plastics and <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> have been assessed as [...] "relatively good" [...] in overall costs, although no packaging is always better. The major problem, however, {{is that the}} hydrapulping facilities are not that common, and thus the multimaterial packages are relatively difficult to recycle. Tetra Pak, a notable company in the industry, has launched an initiative to increase the recycling of aseptic containers. A 1995 book on recycling notes that aseptic containers were not widely recycled. In 1993, <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> could be recycled in 19 US states. Confusion over whether <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> can be recycled led to a 1990 ban on them in Maine. The ban was repealed in 1994.|$|R

5000|$|Since the <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> contain {{different}} layers of plastic and aluminium {{in addition to}} raw paper, they cannot be recycled as [...] "normal" [...] paper waste, but {{need to go to}} special recycling units for separation of the different materials. Tetra Pak has operated limited recycling since the mid-1980s, introducing a recycling program for its cartons in Canada as early as 1990. In 2000, Tetra Pak invested ฿20 million (€500,000) in the first recycling plant for <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> in Thailand. Recycling of the <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> has indeed been one of Tetra Pak's big challenges. Once separated, the aseptic carton results in aluminium and pure paraffin, which can be used in industry. Even without separating the carton materials, however, the aseptic carton can be reused, a Tetra Pak spokesman said, for example in engineering equipment. In 2010, 30 billion used Tetra Pak carton packages were recycled, a doubling since 2002. The company stated that it aims to help double the recycling rate within the next ten years, something that will require an engagement within the whole recycling chain. As of 2011, 20% of Tetra Pak cartons are recycled globally, with countries like Belgium, Germany, Spain and Norway showing local recycling rates of over 50%. To increase the level of recycling and meet the targets, Tetra Pak has engaged in driving recycling activities such as facilitating the development of collection schemes, launch new recycling technologies and raise the awareness about recycling and sustainability. Used Tetra Pak packages have been used as construction material in different design projects, with varying results.|$|R

The Tetra Brik comes in either chilled (Tetra Brik) or ambient (Tetra Brik <b>Aseptic)</b> <b>package</b> types.|$|R
50|$|International {{expansion}} {{had begun}} {{by the beginning}} of the 1960s, when the first production plant outside of Sweden was established in Mexico in 1960, soon to be followed by another in the United States in 1962. In 1962, the first Tetra Classic Aseptic machine outside of Europe was installed in Lebanon. The late 1960s and 1970s saw a global expansion of the company, much due to the new Tetra Brik <b>Aseptic</b> <b>package,</b> launched in 1969, which opened up new markets in the developing world and sparked off a virtual explosion in sales.|$|R

5000|$|Aseptic {{processing}} is {{the process}} by which a sterile (aseptic) product (typically food or pharmaceutical) is packaged in a sterile container in a way that maintains sterility. Sterility is achieved with a flash-heating process (temperature between 195 and 295 °F (91 to 146 °C)), which retains more nutrients and uses less energy than conventional sterilization techniques such as retort or hot-fill canning. Pharmaceutical Sterile processing includes use of clean rooms, bacteria retaining filters, dry or steam heat. Aseptic food preservation methods allow processed food to keep {{for long periods of time}} without preservatives, as long as they are not opened. The <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> are typically a mix of paper (70%), polyethylene (LDPE) (24%), and aluminum (6%), with a tight polyethylene inside layer. Sterile pharmaceuticals are usually packaged in plastic or glass. Together these materials form a tight seal against microbiological organisms, contaminants, and degradation, eliminating the need for refrigeration.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, CJ {{went through}} periods of {{conversion}} and growth as it transitioned {{into the area}} of life and culture from focusing on the food and pharmaceutical industry. However, it continued to develop new food products such as 'Condition', a supplemental drink that alleviates hangover symptoms, in 1992 and 'Hetbahn', an <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaged</b> rice, in 1996.In July 1993, Cheil Jedang spun off from Samsung and gained independent management, changing into a life and culture group by entering into the food service and entertainment industries. In 1996 it became 'Cheil Jedang Group' and completed its official separation from Samsung Group in February 1997.Since then, CJ has entered into the fields of media, entertainment, finance and information & communication businesses mainly through M&As of companies such as m.net, a music cable channel, and Cheil Investment & Securities in 1997, and establishments of new subsidiaries such as Cheil Golden Village (currently CGV) in 1996, Dreamline (which was sold off in 2001), jointly with Korea Expressway in 1997, GLS in 1998, CJ O Shopping, CJ Europe and CJ FD (standing for food distribution) in 1999.

5000|$|Tetra Pak {{operates}} globally through 40 market companies, {{which are}} subsidiaries to Tetra Pak International SA, {{doing business in}} over 170 countries. Because of the low relative cost of its end products, the developing world {{has been an important}} market for Tetra Pak from the start. In 2010, Tetra Pak reported a 5.2% increase in sales, with an annual turnover of almost €10 billion. In its 2010/2011 annual report, Tetra Pak announced particularly strong growth in China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Central and South America. Rising income levels in these markets enabled higher consumption of protein-rich foodstuffs such as dairy products, and Tetra Pak has announced that it will increase investment in the emerging markets by 10% to over €200 million (2009). After investing close to €200 million in new packaging plants in Russia (2007) and China (2008), in 2011 Tetra Pak announced the construction of new packaging plants in India and Pakistan to meet increasing demand. The new plants on the Indian sub-continent are thought to supply the growing demand in the Middle East. The Financial Times reported that the rise in milk consumption in emerging markets particularly regarded UHT milk, facilitating transportation and food safety, something which is favourable for Tetra Pak whose <b>aseptic</b> <b>packages</b> represent two-thirds of its sales. Tetra Pak's most popular product is the Tetra Brik Aseptic, a best-seller since the 1970s. In May 2011 Tetra Pak launched the first aseptic carton bottle for milk, the Tetra Evero Aseptic.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} Tetra Pak {{case as a}} {{real-world}} example to study the implications of multiproduct activity for European Competition Policy. Tetra Pak, a monopolist in <b>aseptic</b> carton <b>packaging</b> of liquid food, competes with Elopak in the nonaseptic sector. The EC Commission used the effect of Tetra Pak's dominance in the aseptic sector on its rival's performance as an evidence of the former's anticompetitive behavior. With linear demand and cost functions and interdependent demands, the Commission's position can be supported. However, a more general model suggests that the Commission's conclusions cannot be supported as the unique outcome of {{the analysis of the}} information available...|$|R
50|$|Tetra Pak has {{occasionally}} {{been subject}} to controversy, most notably regarding its near-monopoly position on certain markets for many years. Especially attempts at mergers have {{been subject to}} scrutiny. Its merger with French PET-production company Sidel in 2001 drew anti-competition allegations from the European Commission. The court case was drawn out for many years and twice appealed to the European Court of First Instance before the European Court of Justice ruled in favour of Tetra Laval. In 2004, Tetra Pak was accused of using its near-monopoly in China, where it held 95% on the market for <b>aseptic</b> carton <b>packaging.</b> The allegations were contested by Tetra Pak.|$|R
50|$|Tetra Pak uses <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging</b> technology. In aseptic {{processing}} {{the product and}} the package are sterilized separately and then combined and sealed in a sterile atmosphere, in contrast to canning, where product and package are first combined and then sterilized. When filled with ultra-heat treated (UHT) foodstuffs (liquids like milk and juice or processed food like vegetables and preserved fruits), the aseptic packages can be preserved without being chilled for up to one year, {{with the result that}} distribution and storage costs, as well as environmental impact, is greatly reduced and product shelf life expanded.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium is {{used for}} {{packaging}} as it is highly malleable: it can be easily converted to thin sheets and folded, rolled or packed.

Aluminium foil containers and trays are used to bake pies and to pack takeaway meals, ready snacks and long life pet foods.|$|E
5000|$|Tetra Pak {{was founded}} by Ruben Rausing and built on Erik Wallenberg's innovation, a tetrahedron-shaped plastic-coated paper carton, from which the company name was derived. In the 1960s and 1970s, the {{development}} of the Tetra Brik package and the <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging</b> technology made possible a cold chain supply, substantially facilitating distribution and storage. From the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1990s, the company was headed by the two sons of Ruben Rausing, Hans and Gad, who took the company from a family business of six employees, in 1954, to a multinational corporation. Tetra Pak is currently the largest food packaging company in the world by sales, operating in more than 170 countries and with over 23,000 employees (2012). The company is privately owned by the family of Gad Rausing through the Swiss-based holding company Tetra Laval, which also includes the dairy farming equipment producer DeLaval and the PET bottle manufacturer Sidel. In November 2011, the Tetra Brik carton package was represented at the exhibition Hidden Heroes - The Genius of Everyday Things at the London Science Museum/Vitra Design Museum, celebrating [...] "the miniature marvels we couldn’t live without". The <b>aseptic</b> <b>packaging</b> technology has been called the most important food packaging innovation of the 20th Century by the Institute of Food Technologists and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences called the Tetra Pak packaging system one of Sweden’s most successful inventions of all time. As of 2011, 20% of Tetra Pak cartons are recycled globally.|$|E
40|$|Nonthermal gas {{discharges}} at atmospheric pressure, such as dielectric barrier discharges {{are currently}} investigated for low-temperature packaging sterilization {{in order to}} reach the conditions required for <b>aseptic</b> food <b>packaging.</b> In particular, understanding the basic sterilization mechanisms and the enhancement of the main bacterial reduction pathways are the goals of our investigations. For this purpose, germ reduction experiments were carried out with Bacillus Subtilis and Aspergillus Niger spores using different gas mixtures and plasma conditions with the direct and the indirect influence of barrier discharges. In order to analyze the contribution of UV radiation during plasma germ deactivation, experiments with different excimer UV lamps, also driven by barrier discharges in special UV-emitting gas mixtures, have been carried out. Results of germ reduction experiments using barrier discharges and prospects for atmospheric discharge systems, suitable for industrial packaging sterilization, are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of this paper: To identify, {{describe}} and categorise supply chain needs on secondary packaging for ambient milk products in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The research {{approach is qualitative}} and includes an embedded single case study of ambient milk supply chains in developing countries. Data collection {{is based on the}} review of internal company documents and semi-structured interviews with industrial experts. Findings: The paper shows that secondary packaging is a vital supply chain component in developing countries and that there are extensive interactions between packaging and the supply chain. The findings also constitute a list of supply chain needs on secondary packaging broken down into six categories. Research limitations/implications: In the investigated supply chains, {{the focus is on the}} actors from the filling point at manufacturers to the point of sale at retail stores in the ambient milk sector. Furthermore, the focus is on <b>aseptic</b> carton <b>packages</b> as primary and regular slotted cartons as secondary packaging. Practical implications: The proposed list of packaging supply chains needs can serve as input to the package design process in order to improve the effectiveness of packages in the supply chain in developing countries. What is original/value of paper: This study complements previous research in the area of packaging and supply chain by exploring supply chain needs on packaging systems in developing countries as a less studied part of a globalised economy...|$|R
