40|$|A new method, {{reversed}} <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> for decreasing N 2 O from {{fluidised bed}} combustion, {{was investigated in}} a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed boiler. Previous measurements, showing that the N 2 O is decreased to one fourth (25 ppm), and NO to half(40 ppm) with maintained sulphur capture, were confirmed. Supplementary information on reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> was obtained from additional measurements. By adjusting the temperature and the air ratio {{it was possible to}} reduce the CO emission. Thus, the N 2 O emission can be reduced to the level of 25 ppm, with the emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO maintained at about same level as with normal <b>air</b> <b>staging.</b> Low load in combination with reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> resulted in:further reduced emissions. The effect of reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on the emissions from peat {{is similar to that of}} bituminous coal. There is no negative effect of reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on the combustion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> is {{a method}} to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emissions}} from circulating fluidized bed boilers (FBBs). Tests in a 12 MW circulating FBB show that the N 20 emission can be lowered to one fourth without affecting the emissions of NO,SO 2 or CO and without adverse effects on the combustion efficiency. The focus of the paper is on the conditions in the combustion chamber. Measurements inside the combustion chamber reveal how the combustion conditions are affected by reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> compared to normal <b>air</b> <b>staging.</b> These measurements confirm the working principle of reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> namely to provide more oxidizing conditions in {{the lower part of}} the combustion chamber and lower stoichiometry in the upper part of the combustion chamber...|$|R
40|$|Three {{separate}} estimators, for {{the estimation}} of the population total, based on two-stage sampling design on two successive occasions with partial replacement of secondary <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> only have been presented. For these estimators {{it is assumed that}} there is unit non-response. Hence, Hansen and Hurwitz (1946) technique has been used to adjust for the non-response. Empirically, it has been found that the estimator that uses individual weights within first <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> perform better than the other estimators that use common weights in estimating the population total. Theoretically, it has also been shown that the larger the ratio of the within first <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> variability of the non-respondents to the between first <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> variability the higher the gain in efficiency of the proposed estimators over the estimator obtained when there is no partial matching of units...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBiomass (straw and wood) {{co-firing}} with coal {{was investigated}} in a drop tube furnace. Emission of NO and CO along {{the height of the}} furnace was monitored by a gas analyzer on line, and the content of unburned carbon (UBC) in fly ash was also tested. The effects of fuel type, temperature, co-firing and <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> ratio were considered. Results showed that along the height of the furnace, NO concentration increased first and then decreased slowly for all the fuels, and NO emission from straw or wood combustion only accounted for about 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 of that from coal combustion respectively. In the present temperature range of 900 - 1100 oC, the increasing in temperature increased NO emission but decreased UBC in some degree, while the effect on CO emission was little. Under the condition of biomass co-firing, NO emission, CO emission and UBC were significantly reduced more with the increasing in biomass co-firing ratio. Moreover, results of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> combustion showed that for coal combustion <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> notably reduced NO emission while increased UBC and CO emission, but for biomass combustion the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> was less significant. Further test of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on biomass co-firing indicated that only under the co-firing ratio of 0. 4 could <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> play a great influence on NO emission and combustion efficiency. This present study could provide a guide for the optimization of biomass co-firing in industrial furnaces...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> is a {{well-known}} effective method to control NOx emissions from solid fuel combustion boilers. However, further research is still needed to clarify the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> at different injection locations on the gaseous emissions of Fluidised Bed Combustion (FBC) boilers that fire 100 % biomass fuels, particularly non-woody biomass fuels. The main objective of this work is to investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>staging</b> <b>air</b> injection location on the gaseous emissions (NOx and CO) and temperature profiles of a 20 kWth bubbling fluidised bed combustor firing three non-woody (straw, miscanthus and peanuts) and two woody biomass fuels. The experimental results showed that injecting the secondary air at the higher location could lead to a greater NOx reduction {{due to the fact that}} the biomass combustion reaction mainly took place in the splash zone and/or beginning of the freeboard. Up to 30 % of NOx reduction, compared with no <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> was achieved for the non-woody fuels when the <b>staging</b> <b>air</b> was injected at the higher position. <b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> also significantly reduced the CO emissions as a result of the higher temperatures in the freeboard and longer residence time in the primary combustion zone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract - Two {{methods for}} the {{reduction}} of nitrous oxide emissions, afterbuming and reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> are investigated in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. With afterburning the N 2 O emission can be reduced by 90 % or more, using an amount of secondary fuel corresponding to 10 % of the total energy input. With reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> {{it is possible to}} reduce the emission of N 2 O to one fourth (25 ppm), without significantly affecting the other emissions. With reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> no secondary <b>air</b> is used in the combustor and an air-ratio of about unity is maintained throughout the combustion chamber.

40|$|Reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> {{a method}} for {{reduction}} of N 2 O emissions, was studied in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. The effect of combustor air-ratio, bed temperature, load and limestone addition ratio was investigated. The results indicate that if only the air distribution is changed, the emission of N 2 O can be decreased to one fourth compared to normal <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> at a temperature of 850 °C, with maintained low emissions of NO,´SO 2 and CO. With increased bed temperature, 870 °C, in combination with increased limestone addition, from Ca/S molar ratio = 3 to 4, {{it was possible to}} reduce N 2 O by 90 vol% with low emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO. The method was less efficient at low load, because of the lower cyclone temperature. Also the effect of redistribution of some of the air added in the cyclone outlet to the cyclone inlet was studied. This did not, however, give any improvement in the boiler used compared to adding all of the air in the cyclone outlet.

40|$|Gaseous and {{particulate}} emissions {{have been investigated}} with different <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> strategies {{over a wide range}} of secondary air flow rates. Laboratory scale wood pellet combustor, supplied by an underfeed fuel bed input, is used. The <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> strategies have been employed to study burning rate, temperature in primary and post combustion zones, and NO, CO and PM emissions, taking into account the air to fuel stoichiometric ratio. 50 % CO reduction and 9 times less particle mass concentration than non-staged combustion are achieved by deploying a uniform secondary air module in a higher position from the bed. The minimum NO (37 % reduction than non-staged) measured in the non-uniform air distribution module at the higher flow rate with lower distance from the fuel bed. The results demonstrate a trade-off between NO and CO, PM emissions but also significant potential for reducing particulate and gaseous emissions by deploying <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> in the pellet combustor...|$|R

In this study, two different secondary air distribution modules are employed at two different axial positions {{from the bed}} surface in a 15 kW fixed-bed laboratory scale combustion system includes grate and underfeed bed stocker. The effects of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on temperature, burning rate, gaseous and particulate emissions have been assessed over a selected primary air flow rate {{and a range of}} secondary air flow rates. Secondary air inlet module with uniform distribution of air results in 50 % CO reduction by shifting the combustion to a more fuel lean environment and high temperature in the post-combustion zone. Remarkable decrease in particulate matters smaller than 1 μm is achievable through adjusting a uniform secondary air module in an appropriate distance from the bed. The non-uniform secondary air configuration increases the gaseous and particulate emissions than the uniform configuration. These results emphasise the need for further studies to better understand the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on particulate and gaseous emissions...|$|R
