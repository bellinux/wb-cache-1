5000|$|Congestion pricing {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{alternative}} demand side (as opposed to supply side) strategies offered by economists to address traffic congestion. [...] Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists. An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to a third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a public good: for example, if manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public <b>air.</b> <b>Congestion</b> pricing is an efficiency pricing strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society.|$|E

Since 1968, the four major airports in the United States, La Guardia, Washington National, John F.

40|$|Abstract: The yearly {{congestion}} {{costs in}} the U. S airline industry {{are estimated to be}} more than three billions. In China, the delay problem caused by <b>air</b> <b>congestion</b> also becomes more and more serious. An effective method for reducing the delay cost in air traffic flow management is by using ground-holding policy. When numbers of flights are big, it is difficult to calculate the real-time solution of it. A new recursion event-driven model is presented in this paper considering different delay cost. Discrete-event analyze method has been used to solve the single airport ground-holding problem. The concept of delay time equivalent quantity has been presented to solve the combination optimization problem and a fast algorithm was given basing on it. The simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed model and algorithm...|$|E
