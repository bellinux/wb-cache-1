5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river {{to protect it from}} floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be <b>attached</b> <b>with,</b> which is hard to identify today.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of December, Nicolls was {{directed}} to join the expedition against New Orleans. Nicolls joined General Edward Pakenham's force, accompanied by less than 100 Seminole, Creek, and Choctaw warriors. At the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815, Nicolls was <b>attached,</b> <b>with</b> some of his men, to the brigade commanded by Colonel William Thornton of the 85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers). Nicolls was the senior-ranking officer of the Royal Marines present at the battle, but Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane forbade Nicolls {{to take part in}} the fighting personally, fearing that mishap to Nicolls might deprive the British of their most competent officer serving with the Creeks and Seminoles. The actual battlefield command of the 100 Royal Marines brigaded with the 85th Foot went to a less senior officer, Major Thomas Benjamin Adair, commanding officer of the Marine detachment on HMS Vengeur. Nicolls embarked HMS Erebus on 12 January at Cat Island Roads, and disembarked at Apalachicola on 25 January, accompanied by several Creek warriors and a number of Royal Marine reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|The SASR {{then moved}} to eastern Afghanistan where it {{played a key role}} in Operation Anaconda in March 2002. During the {{operation}} SASR teams were to provide on-location, in-depth operational intelligence and reconnaissance after they infiltrated the Shahi-Kot Valley ten days prior to the operation, and also saved the lives of 24 soldiers of the US 75th Ranger Regiment after their helicopter was shot down, by providing sniper overwatch and guiding in precise air strikes to end the enemy advance as they attempted to overrun the isolated Americans. Up to 300 al Qaeda fighters were later estimated to have been killed as a result of the airstrikes they called-in. Two SASR advisory and liaison officers were <b>attached</b> <b>with</b> the US 10th Mountain Division to help plan the division's air assault operations, and were subsequently involved in heavy fighting after the unit they were with became pinned down and took a number of casualties. Supported by heavy close air support they were evacuated by helicopter that evening.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been <b>attached</b> <b>with</b> the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with a razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be <b>attached</b> <b>with</b> his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt <b>attached</b> <b>with</b> a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} jewellery, beads, and charms was also found. 100 beads in total were {{recovered}} from 16 graves, though only two {{had more than}} 10 beads. The small number of beads found in the remaining 14 graves is indicative of how styles had changed; in the 6th century it was customary for women to wear up to 100 relatively plain beads {{at a time in}} the form of necklaces, but by the mid-7th century, the fashion was for a small number of high-quality beads which may have been <b>attached</b> <b>with</b> wire or carried in a bag. A very unusual discovery was made in grave 21– the remnants of a necklace comprising eight beads and two Iron Age gold coins minted by the Corieltauvi tribe of modern Lincolnshire some time between 15–45AD, before the Roman conquest of Britain. Holes had been drilled in the coins, which were more than 600years old {{by the time they were}} buried, to convert them into items of jewellery. Their excellent condition suggests that they had not been used for long, or at all, as currency; it is possible that they had been part of a hoard buried shortly after they were minted and were rediscovered during Saxon times. The discovery of Roman coins in a Saxon grave of this period is unique to the Street House cemetery. It is likely that they were valued because of the cross-shaped designs on the coins' reverse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{geometric}} clearances on {{the stress and}} deformation distributions of a wedged-ring joint structure is studied, five cases of dimensional tolerance of each contact surface, i. e., the maximum, minimum, mean of maximum and minimum, mean of maximum and mean, and mean of minimum and mean are investigated, and the probable states that the wedged-rings <b>attach</b> <b>with</b> the upper cylinder or <b>attach</b> <b>with</b> the lower cylinder radially in the assembly process are considered as well. The results of finite element numerical simulations indicate that in the design tolerance zone, the effects of geometric clearances between contact surfaces on the displacement and stress distributions of the structural components are weak. Only when the wedged-rings <b>attach</b> tightly <b>with</b> the upper cylinder or with the lower cylinder, the displacement and stress distributions in the joint of the structure occur a dramatic variation, and the assembly processing measure making the wedged-rings <b>attaching</b> tightly <b>with</b> the lower cylinder can be adopted to effectively decrease the stresses and deformations in the joint of the structure...|$|R
