25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} normally comprise overlapping circles. The {{interior of}} the circle symbolically represents {{the elements of the}} set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set Venn diagram, one circle may represent the group of all wooden objects, while another circle may represent the set of <b>all</b> <b>tables.</b> The overlapping region or intersection would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn's own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes (cardinality) of sets; i.e. they are schematic diagrams.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, {{a branch}} of Starbucks was {{completed}} on St. James's Street in Kemptown, Brighton, England, despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council, who claimed {{there were too many}} coffee shops already present on the street. Starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee, mugs, and sandwiches, gaining a six-month extension, but the council ordered Starbucks to remove <b>all</b> <b>tables</b> and chairs from the premises, to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop. 2500 residents signed a petition against the store, but after a public inquiry in June 2009, a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain.|$|E

2500|$|In spring 1917, {{shortly after}} the February Revolution toppled the Tsarist regime, Nour's Bessarabian career {{received}} full exposure. The committee for exploring the Special Corps of Gendarmes archive made public his reports to the Okhrana, confirming his colleagues' suspicions and exposing Nour to public shame. Nevertheless, the October Revolution and its aftermath seemed to credit Nour's prophecies: although Romania was losing to the Central Powers, the Moldavian Democratic Republic proclaimed by Bessarabian activists looked set to unite with the defeated country. This was noted at the time by the newly appointed Germanophile Premier of Romania, Alexandru Marghiloman, who credited Nour with having helped revise Romanian foreign policy: [...] " [...] map has since been laid out on <b>all</b> <b>tables</b> of the great European conferences, in all chancelleries, and is the soundest document for {{those who wish to}} untangle the matter of Bessarabia's nationalities." [...] In April 1918, Nour was again in Chișinău, celebrating the positive vote on Bessarabia's union. This was a risky gesture on his part: present at Londra Restaurant, where Marghiloman was being greeted by the unionist leaders, he was spotted by his former friends, and only rescued from near-certain lynching by the intervention of outgoing MDR Prime Minister, his old colleague Petru Cazacu.|$|E
60|$|But {{this is a}} {{day that}} was never read of, a day wherein {{conversion}} is frequent without repentance; such a conversion as it is, and therefore doth the church of God now swarm with them that religiously name the name of Christ, and yet depart not from iniquity. Alas! all houses, <b>all</b> <b>tables,</b> all shops, have hanging up in them {{the sign of the}} want of repentance. (Eccl 7:27,28) To say nothing of the talk, of the beds and the backs of most that profess, by which of these is it that one of a thousand for men; and for women, one of ten thousand, do show that they have repentance? No marvel then that the name of Christ is so frequently mentioned there, where iniquity dwells, yea, reigns, and that with the consent of the mind.|$|E

60|$|Great {{complaints}} have we now among professors, of deadness in duties, barrenness of the ministry, {{and of the}} withdrawing of God {{from his}} people; but I can tell you a cause of all this, namely, the sin {{of the day is}} got into the church of God, and has defiled that holy place. This is the ground and cause of all these things; nor is it like to be otherwise, till the cause shall be removed. If any should ask me what are the sins of our day, I would say they are conspicuous, they are open, they are declared as Sodom's were. (Isa. 3:9) They that have embraced them, are not ashamed of them; yea, they have got the boldness to plead for them, and to count them their enemies that seek to reform them. <b>All</b> <b>tables</b> are full of vomit and filthiness. And for pride and covetousness, for loathing of the gospel, and contemning holiness, as these have covered the face of the nation, as they have infected most of them that now name the name of Christ.|$|E
6000|$|There was no {{anger in}} his bosom {{as he thought}} of this. It would be hardly just {{to say that there}} was jealousy. His nature was {{essentially}} free from jealousy. But there was shame,--and self-accusation at having accepted so great an office with so little fixed purpose as to great work. It might be his duty to subordinate even his pride to the service of his country, and to consent to be a fainéant minister, a gilded Treasury log, because by remaining in that position he would enable the Government to be carried on. But how base the position, how mean, how repugnant to that grand idea of public work which had hitherto been the motive power of all his life! How would he continue to live if this thing were to go on from year to year,--he pretending to govern while others governed,--stalking about from one public hall to another in a blue ribbon, taking the highest place at <b>all</b> <b>tables,</b> receiving mock reverence, and known to all men as fainéant First Lord of the Treasury? Now, as he had been thinking of all this, the most trusted of his friends had come to him, and had at once alluded to the very circumstances which had been pressing so heavily on his mind. [...] "I was delighted," [...] continued the elder Duke, [...] "when I heard that you had determined to go to Gatherum Castle this year." ...|$|E
6000|$|Calderwood and Fraser {{had both}} their followings. The moral {{philosophers}} wore {{an air of}} certainty, for they knew that if they stuck to Calderwood he would pull them through. You cannot lose yourself in the back garden. But the metaphysicians had their doubts. Fraser led them into strange places, {{and said he would}} meet them there again next day. They wandered to their lodgings, and got into difficulties with their landlady for saying that she was only an aggregate of sense phenomena. Fraser was rather a hazardous cure for weak intellects. Young men whose anchor had been certainty of themselves went into that class floating buoyantly on the sea of facts, and came out all adrift--on the sea of theory--in an open boat--rudderless--one oar--the boat scuttled. How could they think there was any chance for them, when the professor was not even sure of himself? I see him rising in a daze from his chair and putting his hands through his hair. [...] "Do I exist," [...] he said, thoughtfully, [...] "strictly so called?" [...] The students (if {{it was the beginning of}} the session) looked a little startled. This was a matter that had not previously disturbed them. Still, if the professor was in doubt, there must be something in it. He began to argue it out, and an uncomfortable silence held the room in awe. If he did not exist, the chances were that they did not exist either. It was thus a personal question. The professor glanced round slowly for an illustration. [...] "Am I a table?" [...] A pained look travelled over the class. Was it just possible that they were <b>all</b> <b>tables?</b> It is no wonder that the students who do not go to the bottom during their first month of metaphysics begin to give themselves airs strictly so called. In the privacy of their room at the top of the house, they pinch themselves to see if they are still there.|$|E
