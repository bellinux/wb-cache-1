40|$|This Article first {{examines}} the conflicting policies of ERISA and the Bankruptcy Code. It then explores how the various courts {{have attempted to}} reconcile these policies {{when faced with the}} issue of whether a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s interest in retirement plan <b>assets</b> should be <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> to creditors in bankruptcy. In analyzing the relevant case law, the Article examines cases addressing the exclusion issue (whether pension plans should be excluded from the bankruptcy estate entirely). It also evaluates cases addressing the exemption issue (whether plan assets, once included in the bankruptcy estate, can be exempted out of the estate by the debtor as part of his fresh start). Finally, the Article proposes extensive amendments to the relevant provisions of both ERISA and the Bankruptcy Code in an effort {{to strike a balance between}} the competing objectives of the two statutes and resolve the conflict that has emerged among the circuits...|$|R
50|$|Most {{approaches}} to retirement spend-down can be likened to individual asset/liability modeling.

50|$|In Marx's view, {{commercial}} trade powerfully {{stimulated the}} growth of a surplus product, not because the surplus product is itself generated by trade, or because trade itself creates wealth (wealth has to be produced before it can be distributed or transferred through trade), but rather because the final purpose of such trade is capital accumulation, i.e. because the aim of commercial trade is to grow richer out of it, to accumulate wealth. If traders did not get an income out of trading (because their sales revenue exceeds their costs) they would not engage in it. Income growth can, ultimately, only occur if the total stock of <b>assets</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> itself grows, as a result of more being produced than existed before. The more surplus there is, the more there is that can be appropriated and traded in order to make money out of it. If people just consume what they produce themselves, other people cannot get rich from that.|$|E

40|$|The Article 9 changes address two {{fundamental}} issues relevant to securitization transaction participants: (i) {{the characterization of}} the asset transfer, and (ii) the clarity and certainty of the process taken to perfect the transferee 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the assets. These changes will eliminate some of the uncertainty that asset-backed security investors and securitization originators face. What the Article 9 changes will also do, however, when {{read in conjunction with}} the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, will be to allow certain financial market participants to avoid participation in the bankruptcy process, notwithstanding their provision of financing to a debtor in bankruptcy. A consequence of these changes is our unwitting abandonment of two socially desirable objectives inherent in the bankruptcy process: (i) the reorganization of potentially viable businesses, and (ii) the equality of distribution of a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s assets among creditors. Accordingly, securitization, under the combined Revised Article 9 /Bankruptcy scheme, may become the most effective judgment proofing mechanism for those debtors {{able to take advantage of}} it. Unfortunately, the impact of such a mechanism will not be felt merely by the parties consenting to the securitization transaction, but by all the participants in the credit markets, as well as all those affected by a firm 2 ̆ 7 s business. The Bankruptcy Code amendments affirmatively carving out from the definition of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s estate certain securitized assets, notwithstanding the circumstances surrounding their transfer, will result in fewer <b>assets</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> to a bankrupt firm 2 ̆ 7 s other creditors. The significance and substantive importance of the definition of what assets are included in the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy estate to the commercial markets cannot be overstated...|$|E
