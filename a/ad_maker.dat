40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{consumption}} of tobacco as a specific cultural phenomenon owing {{to the fact that}} since a tobacco plant has been brought to Europe; its use has spread over other continents and has rooted in many developed civilizations. From the theoretical standpoint, the thesis argues that as cultures are not constant entities, the same applies for public opinions regarding tobacco, from the firm belief that tobacco has positive effects on our health to the stigmatization of tobacco. The paper has four parts. First three parts discuss smoking in marketing communication and further identifies key topics; the final part presents the semiotic analysis of tobacco advertising from the selected periodicals printed (from newspapers and magazines) in the former Czechoslovakia from twenties to fifties of the twentieth century. The main objective is to specify both verbal and visual motives that <b>ad</b> <b>makers</b> used to use in order to create ideological implications of their ads (decoding symbols and interpretation of their meanings). Further, the thesis describes the former advertising style for tobacco products (brands, targeting, products). The methodology of the work is partly {{based on the work of}} Jan Stern (2005, Latent meaning of advertisement text), further some of his terms are being applied in [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the volume of ads has {{increased}} dramatically. This 'ad overload' threatens consumers' involvement with advertising, and <b>ad</b> <b>makers</b> have to devise new strategies to positively affect consumers. Media analysts have speculated about a trend towards ads that provide less guidance {{in the direction of}} a specific interpretation. Based on the semiotic notions of Eco (1979), Paul Ketelaar and Marnix Van Gisbergen describe this decrease in guidance as openness in advertising, and discuss the following questions. Is openness an efficient advertising strategy? How useful is the concept of openness in an advertising context? Is there a trend towards openness in advertising? Do open ads hold attention better than closed ones? How do consumers interpret open ads, and do they appreciate them? Paul Ketelaar and Marnix van Gisbergen answer these questions from a social scientific perspective. They formulate five antecedents that render an ad more open: presence of a prominent visual, presence of rhetorical figures, absence of the product, absence of verbal anchoring, and a low level of brand anchoring. They distinguish four categories of open ads: riddle ads, story ads, issue ads, and aesthetic ads. Their content analysis showed that during the past decades ads have become more open. Although the literature generally stresses positive outcomes of openness on consumer reactions, five experiments showed preliminary support for the arguments stressing a possible dark side of openness for consumer response. Paul Ketelaar and Marnix van Gisbergen found negative effects of openness on interpretation, attitude towards the ad and the brand, and null-effects on attention and recall. Considering its clear negative effects and the large amounts of money involved in the advertising business, an open ad-strategy seems risky. Their research-project was funded by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), and conducted at the Department of Communication Science of the Radboud University Nijmegen...|$|R
