40|$|Social Delay Tolerant Networks (SDTNs) are {{a special}} kind of Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) that {{consists}} of a number of mobile devices with social characteristics. The current research achievements on routing algorithms tend to separately evaluate the <b>available</b> <b>profit</b> for each prospective relay node and cannot achieve the global optimal performance in an overall perspective. In this paper, we propose a Movement Pattern-Aware optimal Routing (MPAR) for SDTNs, by choosing the optimal relay node(s) set for each message, which eventually based on running a search algorithm on a hyper-cube solution space. Concretely, the movement pattern of a group of node(s) can be extracted from the movement records of nodes. Then the set of commonly visited locations for the relay node(s) set and the destination node is obtained, by which we can further evaluate the co-delivery probability of the relay node(s) set. Both local search scheme and tabu-search scheme are utilized in finding the optimal set, and the tabu-search based routing Tabu-MPAR is proved able to guide the relay node(s) set in evolving to the optimal one. We demonstrate how the MPAR algorithm significantly outperforms the previous ones through extensive simulations, based on the synthetic SDTN mobility model. Comment: 18 page...|$|E
40|$|Software {{correctness}} has bedeviled {{the field}} of computer science since its inception. Software complexity has increased far more quickly than our ability to control it, reaching sizes that are many orders of magnitude {{beyond the reach of}} formal or automated verification techniques. We propose a new paradigm for evaluating “correctness ” based on a rich market ecosystem in which coalitions of users bid for features and fixes. Developers, testers, bug reporters, and analysts share in the rewards for responding to those bids. In fact, we suggest that the entire software development process can be driven by a disintermediated market-based mechanism driven by the desires of users and the capabilities of developers. The abstract, unspecifiable, and unknowable notion of absolute correctness is then replaced by quantifiable notions of correctness demand (the sum of bids for bugs) and correctness potential (the sum of the <b>available</b> <b>profit</b> for fixing those bugs). We then sketch the components of a market design intended to identify bugs, elicit demand for fixing bugs, and source workers for fixing bugs. The ultimate goal is to achieve a more appropriate notion of correctness, in which market forces drive software towards a correctness equilibrium in which all bugs for which there is enough value, and with low enough cost to fix, are fixed...|$|E
40|$|In {{an economy}} {{in which a}} {{producer}} must learn the preferences of a consumer population, it is faced with a classic decision problem: when to explore and when to exploit. If the producer has {{a limited number of}} chances to experiment, it must explicitly consider the cost of learning (in terms of foregone profit) against the value of the information acquired. Information goods add an additional dimension to this problem; due to their flexibility, they can be bundled and priced according to a number of different price schedules. An optimizing producer should consider the profit each price schedule can extract, as well as the difficulty of learning of this schedule. In this paper, we demonstrate the tradeoff between complexity and profitability for a number of common price schedules. We begin with a one-shot decision as to which schedule to learn. Schedules with moderate complexity are preferred in the short and medium term, as they are learned quickly, yet extract a significant fraction of the <b>available</b> <b>profit.</b> We then turn to the repeated version of this one-shot decision and show that moderate complexity schedules, in particular two-part tariff, perform well when the producer must adapt to nonstationarity in the consumer population. When a producer can dynamically change schedules as it learns, it can use an explicit decision-theoretic formulation to greedily select the schedule which appears to yield the greatest profit in the next period...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{continuous}} video {{has emerged}} as {{an important element of}} the multimedia technology revolution. Applications such as digital libraries, distance learning, digital broadcasting and virtual conferencing promise to stretch the information technology to its limits. It is widely accepted that the problem of supporting continuous video (either live or stored) with Quality of Service (QoS) will decide the future course of these important applications, and hence that of information technology itself. A major challenge in this problem is providing tiered (involving multiple, disparate users) QoS while maximizing resources utilization, so that each of the applications can be economically offered. ^ Providing QoS in an application server, such as a video server, involves admission control and scheduling. Admission control is a means of deciding whom to admit and what service to offer to maximize the <b>available</b> <b>profit.</b> Given any suitable admission control scheme, it is the task of scheduling to ensure that individual users are provided with acceptable QoS. In this thesis, we present a model and a scheduling algorithm which together provide tiered QoS in continuous video applications. The model captures application QoS requirements in a form suitable for scheduling, and the algorithm performs resource management, such that the individual applications are provided with acceptable QoS. The implementation of the algorithm in a prototype video server and its performance involving MPEG encoded video clips and multiple client streams will be presented. The results indicate that the algorithm, (1) ably meets the disparate QoS requirements of users; (2) simultaneously maximizes the server 2 ̆ 7 s ability to support a large number of users, and (3) imposes very little implementation overhead. The proposed model and the algorithm are easily applicable to bundled continuous media, including voice and video. ^ In addition, we present policies for supporting end-to-end deadlines in live video applications. We augment these policies by extending the proposed algorithm to provision multi-tier QoS in a video bridge that facilitates live video teleconferencing involving multiple streams. Simulation results indicate that our approach drastically improves the deadline miss rate and the supportable load for any given deadline miss rate. ...|$|E

40|$|Dairy {{cattle in}} New Zealand {{account for about}} 17 % of the country’s total {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) load. As the nation progresses {{in its efforts to}} reduce these emissions, is likely that the dairy industry will face physical constraints and/or financial costs associated with their mitigation. For this study, a non-linear optimization model was developed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of diverse mitigation strategies for reducing GHG loads between 10 – 30 % within systems of different production intensity in the main dairy farming regions of New Zealand: Waikato and Canterbury. Pastoral dairy farms, as found in New Zealand, are complex farming systems with many interdependent management variables and any change in one of these variables in order to reduce GHG emissions will inevitably affect the system as a whole, generating changes in its physical and economic outputs. Computer modelling is thus highly suited to evaluate alternative strategies, given its capacity to represent and consider these interdependencies simultaneously. De-intensification, by reducing any combination of stocking rate, nitrogen fertiliser and supplement use, was a key strategy in reducing GHG emissions in an economic manner across the whole range of farming systems and regions considered in this study, as well as for all levels of emissions constraints tested. The mean farm profit reduction found under this level of mitigation across all studied systems was 6 %, when no other mitigation strategies were available. To achieve this, the mean reduction in stocking rate was 8. 8 % and the mean nitrogen fertilizer reduction was 36 %. Nitrogen fertiliser usage increases GHG emissions by increasing the available mineral nitrogen in soil and thus increasing denitrification and also by increasing enteric methane emissions as more fibrous feed is available to be consumed. The mean profit reduction was 6. 9 % and 4. 9 % for the Waikato and Canterbury regions, respectively. The Canterbury medium-input system had a lower cost of mitigation than the other systems, {{associated with the use of}} more supplements with high embedded GHG emissions in the baseline. Accordingly, the use of this kind of supplement was quickly reduced by the optimization model in the mitigation scenarios. At the other end, the Canterbury high input system had the highest cost of mitigation, arising from a combination of larger GHG-e reductions required in absolute terms and the low profitability of the baseline plan, given its high use of imported supplement. In contrast, the abatement cost in the Waikato systems was intermediate between these two extremes. Improved reproductive performance and improved genetic merit of the herd were selected as optimal in all cases where specific mitigation strategies were <b>available.</b> <b>Profit</b> was reduced by 1. 6 %, on average, in this case when 10 % GHG emissions reductions were imposed. To adapt to this constraint, stocking rate was reduced by 8. 1 %, while N fertilizer was reduced by 30. 7 %, on average. Thus, although the availability of specific mitigation strategies was valuable in reducing the profit losses arising from mitigation, these were not sufficient to reduce emissions without some degree of de-intensification. Other mitigation strategies, like removing cows from pasture or the use of denitrification inhibitors, were not always cost effective and only entered the optimal solution when higher levels of mitigation were imposed. This demonstrates that the high cost of adopting these specific mitigation strategies is only warranted when systems are exposed to larger profit reductions associated with higher levels of de-intensification. A quick calculation using average reduction in milksolids production found in this study shows that the loss of revenue of the dairy industry if 30 % mitigation of GHG is imposed can represent as much as half the export earnings of the entire beef industry of the nation...|$|E

In this paper, I analyze the decisions made by an MIT trained economist running a company that delivers bagels and donuts. The simplicity and transparency of the business (e. g. marginal cost is easily observed) allow for direct tests of profit maximization in the quantities delivered each day and the prices that are charged. Using thirteen years of data representing more than 80, 000 deliveries, I find that the company is extremely adept at determining how many bagels and donuts to deliver to a particular customer on a given day. In stark contrast, the company appears to price on the inelastic portion of the demand curve for the entire period, thereby foregoing a substantial share of <b>available</b> <b>profits.</b> I argue that these results generalize well beyond this particular case study: firms are likely to be close to the efficient frontier on dimensions for which there is frequent and informative feedback regarding profits, but absent that feedback, systematic deviations from profit maximization are more likely. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{terrorism}} on global oil prices {{has been largely}} explained through demand-side effects. We estimate an empirical model to re-examine the effect of terrorism {{on the price of}} global oil stocks across oil market regimes that reflect different supply constraints. We believe that terrorism will have larger impacts when global capacity is tight (i. e. when global demand is close to global supply). This means that any shock to capacity (say by conflict) should have the largest impact on profits before the first OPEC shock in the early 1970 s. Since then, conflict shocks would not allow firms to exploit production in the same way, thus re-ducing the <b>available</b> <b>profits</b> that could be garnered by such production manipulation. If capacity constraints are binding when a conflict occurs, then we predict that a positive stock price reaction can be expected for oil firms from such a shock. We exploit a new panel dataset to in-vestigate the relationship between oil profitability and conflict, using conflict data from the top 20 oil producing and exporting countries in the world. We show that in the later part of our sample, 1974 – 2005, as cartel behavior of OPEC member countries has diminished and as conflict has become more regular and thus the information surrounding it noisier, oil stock prices do not increase in response to conflict. How-ever, in earlier capacity constrained eras, we find that oil stocks can in fact increase in response to conflict. In some cases, the impact of conflict may cause the return of oil stocks to increase by as much as 10 per-centage points. 1...|$|R
