40|$|We report how breve, a {{simulation}} environment with rich 3 d graphics, {{was used to}} discover significant patterns in the dynamics {{of a system that}} evolves controllers for swarms of goal-directed agents. These patterns were discovered via visualization {{in the sense that we}} had not considered their relevance or thought to look for them initially, but they became obvious upon visually observing the behavior of the system. In this paper we briefly describe breve and the system of evolving swarms that we implemented within it. We then describe two discovered properties of the evolutionary dynamics of the system: transitions to/from genetic drift regimes and the emergence of collective or multicellular organization. We comment more generally on the utility of 3 d visualization for the discovery of biologically significant phenomena and briefly describe our ongoing work in this <b>area.</b> <b>Pointers</b> are provided to on-line resources including source code and animations that demonstrate several of the described effects.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{evaluating}} the geophysical parameters of the shallow subsurface for ground water development of the study area. Four profiles of vertical electrical sounding (VES) were obtained in the north - eastern sector of Akwa Ibom State to examine the subsurface geology and the associated groundwater potential. The combination of VES data and the borehole data provided useful information on subsurface hydrogeologic conditions. Within {{the western part of}} the study area covering Obot Akara local government, a sizeable open aquifer was delineated whereas the north eastern part covering Ini local government area has a thick layer of aquitard from the depth of about 10 to 105 m. An isolated resistivity value of the aquitard appear to be extremely high (6130 Ωm) in the deeper layer and this indicates the possibility of intrusive from deep seated layers intruding into low resistivity aquitard. The hydrogeological parameters such as transmissivity, longitudinal conductance and transverse resistance in the Western part of the study <b>area</b> are <b>pointers</b> that the aquifers are prolific...|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} chapter uses {{case studies}} based on recent engineering applications, to re-examine the non-minimal, state variable feedback approach to control system design. We {{show how the}} non-minimal state space (NMSS) representation {{seems to be the}} natural description of a discrete-time Transfer Function, since its dimension is dictated by the complete structure of the model. This is in contrast to minimal state space descriptions, which only account for the order of the denominator and whose state variables, therefore, usually represent combinations of input and output signals. The resulting control algorithm can be interpreted as a logical extension of the conventional Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, facilitating its straightforward implementation using a standard hardware-software arrangement. Finally, the basic NMSS approach is readily extended into multivariable, model-predictive and nonlinear control systems, hence the chapter briefly discusses these <b>areas</b> and gives <b>pointers</b> to the latest research results...|$|R
40|$|A light-addressable {{potentiometric}} sensor (LAPS) can measure {{the concentration of}} one or several analytes at the sensor surface simultaneously in a spatially resolved manner. A modulated light pointer stimulates the semiconductor structure at the area of interest and a responding photocurrent can be read out. By simultaneous stimulation of several <b>areas</b> with light <b>pointers</b> of different modulation frequencies, the read out can be performed at the same time. With the new proposed controller electronic based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), {{it is possible to}} control the modulation frequencies, phase shifts, and light brightness of multiple light pointers independently and simultaneously. Thus, it is possible to investigate the frequency response of the sensor, and to examine the analyte concentration by the determination of the surface potential with the help of current/voltage curves and phase/voltage curves. Additionally, the ability to individually change the light intensities of each light pointer is used to perform signal correction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an auto-recognition method for pointer-type meter based on computer vision. Two calibrated cameras {{are located in}} the right and left sides of the meter to capture the meter displayed images. In each displayed image, the fast Hough transform method is used to locate the approximate <b>pointer</b> <b>area</b> and then the least squares fitting method is used to determine the precise line that represents the pointer indicator. Two precise lines obtained from both right and left displayed images are reconstructed in three-dimensional space according to the epipolar constraint. The line reconstructed is then projected into the target plane to determine the true indication of the meter. Experiments show that the proposed method works very well for the dial pointer identification. The maximum uncertainty in the determination of the pointer’s indication is less than the human eye can discriminate.

40|$|Irregular {{computations}} pose sorne of {{the most}} interesting and challenging problems in automatic parallelization. Irregularity appears in certain kinds of numerical problems and is pervasive in symbolic applications. Such computations often use dynamic data structures, which make heavy use of pointers. This complicates all the steps of a parallelizing compiler, from independence detection to task partitioning and placement. Starting in the mid 80 s there has been significant progress in the development of parallelizing compilers for logic pro­gramming (and more recently, constraint programming) resulting in quite capable paralle­lizers. The typical applications of these paradigms frequently involve irregular computations, and make heavy use of dynamic data structures with pointers, since logical variables represent in practice a well-behaved form of pointers. This arguably makes the techniques used in these compilers potentially interesting. In this paper, we introduce in a tutoríal way, sorne of the problems faced by parallelizing compilers for logic and constraint programs and provide pointers to sorne of the significant progress made in the area. In particular, this work has resulted in a series of achievements in the <b>areas</b> of inter-procedural <b>pointer</b> aliasing analysis for independence detection, cost models and cost analysis, cactus-stack memory management, techniques for managing speculative and irregular computations through task granularity control and dynamic task allocation such as work-stealing schedulers), etc...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades Haddon Robinson's homiletic text Biblical Preaching has been a {{significant}} influence in evangelical homiletics. In an endeavor to evaluate the homiletic method within it, this study asked the following questions: What is Robinson's theological methodology and how does it affect his homiletical method? What is his hermeneutical methodology and how does it affect his homiletical method? These two questions lead into the main issue of this study expressed in two other questions: Is Robinson consistent with his theological and hermeneutical methodology in his homiletical method? What are {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} his ten-stage method? Based on these issues, the purpose of this study was to investigate Robinson's theological and hermeneutical methodology, evaluate his ten-stage method in light of this investigation, and based on any problematic <b>areas,</b> suggest <b>pointers</b> toward new theory and procedure for the enhancement of expository pedagogy. To provide a framework for this study, four homiletical paradigms in contemporary American homiletics were identified and explained. Robinson's method was found to be in one of these paradigms. With this framework in mind, Robinson's theological and hermeneutical methodology was investigated. Following this, his definition of expository preaching with its five components was set forth and investigated. It was found that Robinson's expository methodology as expressed in his view of Scripture, hermeneutics, and definition of expository preaching, is a consistent foundation for his ten-stage method. Nevertheless, several problematic issues were noted. Having investigated Robinson's expository methodology, this study formally evaluated his ten-stage method and found its center of gravity to be on the two center stages dealing with the homiletical idea and purpose statement. Furthermore, this evaluation found the ten stages to be consistent with Robinson's definition of expository preaching in its movement from interpretation to application. In seven of the stages, however, this study found deficiencies due to procedural weaknesses and a lack of theoretical focus. The study concluded with ten pointers based on the problem areas addressed throughout the investigation and evaluation. These pointers suggested a new theory and procedure to enhance expository pedagogy and practice. Philosophy, Practical and Systematic TheologyD. Th. (Pratical Theology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{attempts}} {{to give a}} high-level overview {{of the field of}} artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believ-able agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: (1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; (2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and (3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research <b>areas</b> provides a <b>pointer</b> to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields...|$|R
