50|$|<b>Autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> is {{the natural}} ability of {{cementitious}} materials to repair cracks. This ability is principally attributed to further hydration of unhydrated cement particles and carbonation of dissolved calcium hydroxide. Cementitious materials in fresh-water systems can autogenously heal cracks up to 0.2 mm {{over a period of}} 7 weeks.|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{cracking}} is in {{some cases}} inevitable. <b>Autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> {{may prove to be}} useful to limit repair works caused by concrete cracking. Further cement hydration, pozzolanic activity by fly ash and calcium carbonate crystallization will hereby heal the cracks if crack widths are limited, and if sufficient building blocks and water are present. Synthetic microfibres may be used to limit the crack width, leading to strainhardening cementitious materials. The water can be provided by the use of superabsorbent polymers, which are extracting moisture from the environment. This moisture can be used for <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> and may lead to a regain in mechanical properties. As the crack seems to be completely visually closed at the surface, one may ask whether this healing also is present in the interior of the crack. Thin section analysis was therefore used to study the extent of <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> perpendicular to the surface, through a crack. The <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> in a cementitious material is dependent on the crack depth. Only {{the first part of the}} crack is closed by crystal formation in case of wet/dry cycles. In combination with superabsorbent polymers, the extent of healing was more substantial, even in the interior of the crack. The smart cementitious material with superabsorbent polymers thus is an excellent material to use in future building applications...|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{sustainable}} highly-durable structures {{with a long}} service life, {{one should}} tackle the problem of cracking in concrete. Not only is it aesthetically unwanted, cracking may also impair the service life of the construction. Therefore, the ingress of water and harmful substances should ideally be avoided and should be independent of manual repair to be reliable. <b>Autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> in strain-hardening cementitious materials in combination with superabsorbent polymers can be a solution. Here, the superabsorbent polymers will swell to several hundred times their own size when making contact with fluids, thus sealing the crack from intruding fluids. Afterwards, the water is provided to the cementitious matrix for <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing.</b> Further hydration and the precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals may hereby close the crack completely. One {{of the most important}} criterions is the crack width control, as only very narrow cracks may close due to <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing.</b> This is achieved by means of incorporated microfibres, leading to bridging action and multiple cracking. In this research, several types of fibres were tested. These include different types of commercially-available polyvinyl alcohol and polypropylene. It was found that some types of synthetic fibres may accelerate the <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> capacity, due to their chemical nature. The type of fibre can hereby promote the nucleation of calcium carbonate crystals {{on the surface of the}} fibre, stitching the crack. This is especially the case with fibres consisting of polar hydroxyl groups. In combination with superabsorbent polymers, this feature was improved substantially as the water was gradually released towards the cementitious matrix, leading to a more abundant amount of crystals at the crack faces. The natural fibres are alternatives for synthetic fibres due to their good mechanical properties, but should be chemically treated to receive multiple cracking and to act as nucleation sites for calcium carbonate. In general, the most ideal material is a strain-hardening cementitious material with polyvinyl alcohol fibres and superabsorbent polymers. This material can close cracks efficiently and may thus lead to more durable constructions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details of}} an original crack-closure system for cementitious materials using shrinkable polymer tendons.

The feasibility {{of the system is}} demonstrated in a series of small scale experiments on pre-cracked prismatic mortar specimens. The results from these tests show that, upon activation, the polymer tendon completely closes the preformed macro-cracks and imparts a significant stress across the crack faces.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> in a recently developed shrinkable polymer cementitious material system. Small-scale hollow prismatic mortar beams with unbonded shrinkable polymer tendons were loaded until a crack of predefined width had formed.

Upon reloading, specimens loaded with the shrinkable polymer tendons remaining after heating and curing achieved between 120 and 195 % of their initial peak loads, whereas specimens tested with the shrinkable polymer tendons removed after the heating and curing stages recovered on average 80 % of their initial peak loads. The overall conclusion was that, provided a supply of water is present and sufficient heat is applied for polymer activation, the material system is effective at not only closing cracks and applying a prestress, but also at enhancing the self-healing of cracks in cementitious materials...|$|E
40|$|Concrete is very {{sensitive}} to crack formation. As wide cracks endanger the durability, repair may be required.

40|$|There are two {{facts that}} can be taken almost for granted when {{applying}} a cementitious material. One, it will gain the wanted compressive strength and two, it willcrack. As cracking can often not be prevented and repair sometimes happens too late, cracking and water ingress should ideally be controlled by taking preventative steps. Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) can assist to first self-seal a crack upon fluid ingress as their swelling capacity may block a crack from intruding fluids. But also, by releasing their absorbed water, they will promote <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing.</b> In this study, the effect of SAPs on the permeability is investigated by performing low-pressure water permeability and gas permeability tests. Also, the ability of (promoted) <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> is investigated by comparing the mechanical properties after performing repeated four-point-bending tests. Specimens with SAP/C = 0. 01 (SAPs versus cement weight) show a reduction in water permeability by a factor 10 (4) and an increase in gas permeability up to 50 % compared to specimens without SAPs. There was a regain in strength properties when specimens with SAPs were allowed to heal in wet/dry cycles (75 % after 28 days of healing). A cementitious material with SAPs is thus superior to promote self-sealing and self-healing...|$|E

40|$|Design of {{building}} structures and infrastructures is mainly based on four concepts: safety, serviceability, durability and sustainability. The latter {{is becoming increasingly}} relevant {{in the field of}} civil engineering. Reinforced concrete structures are subjected to damages that produce cracks which, if not repaired, can lead to a rapid deterioration and would result into increasing maintenance costs to guarantee the anticipated level of performance. Therefore, self-healing concrete can be very useful in any type of structures, as it allows to control and repairing cracks as soon as they are likely to occur. The effectiveness of self-healing can be improved with the use of fibers due to their capacity to control crack width and enhance multiple crack formation. In that way, researchers should use advanced cement based materials (FRCC, HPFRCC, etc.) and techniques (<b>autogenous</b> and engineering <b>healing)</b> to satisfy all demands in which sustainability and durability are key factors. Compared to the large number of investigations on selfhealing of plain concrete, self-healing studies on Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC) are still limited.

40|$|Research {{has been}} carried out with the aim of better {{understanding}} the relevant properties of materials to be used in a new self-healing cementitious composite material system. The system consists of shape memory polymer tendons embedded within a cementitious matrix, upon heat activation these tendons undergo a shrinkage process which closes any cracks present. After this heat activation, <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> of the cracks is enhanced by the ongoing application of pressure to the cracked faces. In a previous study the build-up of stress in a restrained poly(ethylene terephthalate) specimen upon heat activation was investigated. In the current study, the long term stress relaxation behaviour of such a restrained specimen has been investigated so that its potential for use in the material system described above can be better understood. Both experimental and numerical approaches have been undertaken. A specimen of poly(ethylene terephthalate) was restrained against longitudinal shrinkage and a heat of 90 oC applied for a duration of 10 minutes to simulate the conditions it would be subject to within the system. The stress in the specimen was continuously monitored during heat activation, cooling, and for approximately 6 months after this. This data was used to quantify the stress relaxation of the specimen. The stress relaxation over the period studied was found to be very low; the peak stress was 32. 80 MPa, this fell to a minimum value of 30. 84 MPa after a period of approximately 97 days had elapsed. These low levels of stress relaxation are beneficial to the system since a larger shrinkage force will be applied {{for a longer period of}} time, which should also lead to improved <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> of cracks...|$|E

The importance of sustainability as a requisite which has to inform structure concept and design has been also highlighted in Model Code 2010. Self-healing technologies, by repairing “early-stage cracks in concrete structures”, could prevent “permeation of driving factors for deterioration”, and, in case, even provide partial recovery of engineering properties relevant to the application, thus extending the structure service life. The author’s research group has undertaken a comprehensive research project, focusing on both experimental characterization and numerical modelling of the self-healing capacity of a broad category of cementitious composites, including normal strength concrete and high performance cementitious composites reinforced with either steel or natural fibres. Both <b>autogenous</b> and engineered <b>healing</b> have been considered. Dedicated experimental methodologies have been employed to characterize the healing capacity of the different investigated materials, based on comparative evaluation, in a pre-cracking and a post-conditioning stage, of the mechanical performance.

As a further step a predictive modelling approach, based on modified micro-plane model, has been formulated. The approach incorporates the self-healing effects, in particular, the delayed cement hydration, as well as the effects of cracking on the diffusivity and the opposite repairing effect of the self-healing on the micro-plane model constitutive laws.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to quantitatively {{evaluate}} and qualitatively describe <b>autogenous</b> bone graft <b>healing</b> with or without an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) membrane in ovariectornized rats. Materials and Methods: Eighty Wistar rats, weighing approximately 300 g each, were used. A graft was obtained from the parietal bone and fixed to the sidewall of each animal`s left mandibular ramus. The animals were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n = 20 in each group) : group 1, sham operated and autogenous bone graft only- group 2, sham operated and autogenous bone graft covered by e-PTFE membrane; group 3, ovariectornized (OVX) and autogenous bone graft only- group 4, OVX and autogenous bone graft covered by e-PTFE membrane. The animals were sacrificed at five different time points: immediately after grafting or at 7, 21, 45, or 60 days after grafting. Histologic examination and morphometric measurement of the sections were performed, and values were submitted to statistical analyses. Results: Both groups (sham and OVX) experienced loss of the original graft volume when it was not covered by the membrane, whereas use of the membrane resulted in additional bone formation beyond the edges of the graft and under the membrane. Histologic analysis showed integration of the grafts in all animals, although a larger number of marrow spaces was found in OVX groups. Conclusions: Association of bone graft with an e-PTFE membrane resulted in maintenance of its original volume as well as formation of new bone that filled the space under the membrane. Osteopenia did not influence bone graft repair, regardless of whether or not it was associated with e-PTFE membrane, but descriptive histologic analysis showed larger numbers of marrow spaces in the bone graft and receptor bed and formation of new bone in the OVX animals.

Cracks wider than 10 μm will result, for instance, in a faster penetration of chlorides into the crack and from there onwards into the concrete matrix. Fortunately, the <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> ability of concrete may close cracks of up to 100 μm completely. The further hydration of binder particles, will be supplemented by the deposition of calcium carbonate crystals in case of wet/dry cycles. In case of marine infrastructures in tidal zones, the presence of magnesium sulfates may enhance the crack sealing by means of brucite precipitation. These processes will result in reduced chloride penetration rates. If the cracks are larger than 100 μm or the conditions are not favourable for <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing,</b> autonomous healing mechanisms can be incorporated.

In this work, the self-healing effect of a crystalline admixture for concrete is analysed in different environmental exposures. In order to compare healing capacity of the admixture compared with <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> of concrete, two types of concrete were studied: a control concrete (CC) and a mix containing the crystalline admixture (CAC), with a dosage of 4 % {{by the weight of}} cement. Four exposure conditions were studied: water immersion, water contact with a water layer of two centimetres, humidity chamber and laboratory conditions. Self-sealing/healing was studied by analysing the permeability of the cracked specimens and by observing with a microscope the closing of the crack. As from the obtained results CAC showed better healing behaviour than CC; the healing rates of CC had higher dispersion than those of CAC, which achieved more stable behaviour for all the different exposures and was anyway able to provide some not negligible healing capacity also in open air conditions. Differences between the exposures with direct contact with water were also noticed, indicating the importance of water for the reaction to take place...|$|E
40|$|Micro cracks {{occurring}} in concrete around tensile rebar {{is well known}} latent damage phenomenon. These micro cracks develop, and can be detected after reaching {{the surface of the}} concrete. Detection of these cracks before they are fully formed is preferable, but observing the whole crack structure is difficult. Another problem is repairing micro cracks under the concrete surface. The autogenous ability of bond cracks along rebar was evaluated using the air permeability test. Air permeability coefficients were measured before and after tensile loading, and experimental air permeability coefficients became larger near cracks along rebar as a result of tensile loading. Recuring for 28 days after tensile loading made the air permeability coefficients smaller, but this restriction only occurred during water recuring. Observation of crack patterns helped the understanding of change in the air permeability coefficients. Several small cracks along rebar were observed after tensile loading, and most cracks along rebar were not found after water recuring. On the other hand, the crack pattern did not change after air recuring. These results indicate that bond cracks along rebar can be closed by <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing,</b> and cause the air permeability coefficients...|$|E
30|$|Constructional uses of SAHs mainly include {{preparation}} of cementation (Mignon et al. 2017 b) and demolition of building structures (Ismail et al. 2013). Crack formation because of autogenous shrinkage, decreasing freeze/thawing and other constructional stresses are major concerns for building constructions. Synthetic SAHs {{have been successfully}} experimented to combat this problem through internal curing, self-sealing effect, <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> (Mignon et al. 2017 b). Kinetics and water release behavior of SAHs during cementations have been investigated recently by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Snoeck et al. 2017). However, this approach of using synthetic SAHs has also some innate limitations such as formation of macropores that adversely affects the concrete strength (Gupta et al. 2017; Mechtcherine et al. 2017; Mignon et al. 2017 b; Schröfl et al. 2017). Some recent works (Mignon et al. 2017 a; Mignon et al. 2016; Mignon et al. 2017 c; Mignon et al. 2017 d; Schröfl et al. 2017) have suggested use of cellulose-based SAHs in mitigating the strength problem due to excessive swelling of synthetic SAHs. In contrast, the application for demolition {{is based on the}} opposite principle, using highly absorbing hydrogels (Ismail et al. 2013). Kobayashi et al. (1990) have patented acrylonitrile-graft-starch hydrogel as demolishing agent that swells upon contacting water and thereby weakens the rigid structures through expansion.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} and apply {{self-healing}} concrete as a new method for crack control and enhanced service life in concrete structure. This concept {{is one of the}} maintenance-free methods which, apart from saving direct costs for maintenance and repair, reduces the indirect costs – a saving generally welcomed by contractors. In this research, the self-healing phenomenon of <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> concrete using geo-materials for practical industrial application was investigated. Moreover, a self-healing concrete was fabricated by ready-mixed car in a ready-mixed concrete factory, then used for the construction of artificial water-retaining structures and actual tunnel structures. The results show that the crack of concrete was significantly self-healed up to 28 days re-curing. Crack-width of 0. 15 mm was self-healed af-ter re-curing for 3 days and the crack width decreased from 0. 22 mm to 0. 16 mm after re-curing for 7 days. Furthermore, it was almost completely self-healed at 33 days. It was founded that this phenomenon occurred mainly due to the swell-ing effect, expansion effect and re-crystallization. From these results, it is considered that the utilization of appropriate dosages of geo-materials has a high potential for one of new repairing methods of cracked concrete under the water leakage of underground civil infrastructure such as tunnels...|$|E

The {{first is}} to present the errors, inadaptability, and {{mistakes}} arising when the current theory on concrete is applied to explaining practical construction of concrete; the second is to put forward viewpoints in modern concrete science. Taking a number of engineering cases as examples, we experimentally studied and theoretically analyzed the errors, inadaptability, and mistakes when the current theory on concrete is applied to explaining practical construction of concrete. Moreover, we investigated the use of mixing ratios, aggregates, cement, high-performance concrete and fibers, {{as well as the}} frost resistance, cracking behavior, durability, dry shrinkage and <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> to address and remedy the shortcomings in today’s concrete science, put forward new proposals, and make a number of innovative achievements in the field, particularly in modern theory on concrete science.  The results and topics which will be of particular interest to engineers and researchers include: corrections to several one-sided, even mistaken views on concrete construction in the field and a new theory that can be adopted to improve the durability of concrete projects, to control and improve the implementation quality of concrete projects, and to guide teaching in universities.    Wenke Yang is a distinguished senior engineer at China Airport Construction Group Corporation, General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) ...|$|E
40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} {{is regarded}} as a promising solution to reduce the high maintenance and repair cost of concrete infrastructure. Due to the limited <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> capacity of concrete itself, additives are needed to enhance the self-healing properties. These healing agents are pre-added into the concrete during mixing or casting and are expected to play their role (heal cracks) when cracking occurs. This PhD work aims to explore a microbial-based self-healing strategy for concrete, which has the distinct features of environmental friendliness, long-term viability and low cost. Carbonate precipitating bacteria were added into mortar specimens to in-situ heal concrete cracks when cracking occurred. Two constituents are of crucial importance in this strategy, the microbial source and the carriers for immobilization of bacteria. Bacillus sphaericus, an alkali spore-forming ureolytic strain, was selected as the microbial source due to its high carbonate production capacity, alkali adaptability and long-term viability. Four types of carriers were investigated in this study. In view of the self-healing efficiency and the possibility for practical use, the most promising carriers are microcapsules and superabsorbent polymers. Overall, the results of this doctoral research demonstrated the feasibility of using immobilized carbonate precipitating bacteria for self-healing concrete. The novel carriers used opens the perspective to bring self-healing concrete into practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{serviceability}} {{and durability}} of concrete structures {{has been extensively}} studied by various researchers. Cementitious materials and concrete are {{the most widely used}} in construction site. However, cracking is a well-known phenomenon in concrete engineering. Concrete repairs are inevitable to enhance its service life which evokes additional expenditure separate to the building cost. Therefore, {{one of the most important}} issues is to seal cracks which occur due to drying shrinkage or exposed to external factors. Many researchers have already studied this topic with the intent to control cracking or develop a crack-free concrete. Two alternatives for crack control have been proposed; these include methodologies for either controlling residual stresses or developing ductile concrete. Recently, a lot of researchers are studied various crack control methods and concepts to achieve self-healing phenomenon in past decades. In this review paper, <b>autogenous</b> <b>healing</b> in cementitious materials is reported based on various articles, activity of JCI TC- 075 B (Japan Concrete Institute Technical Committee 075 B), JCI TC- 091 A (Japan Concrete Institute Technical Committee 091 A) and RILEM TC-SHC (Self-healing Phenomena in Cement Based Materials of (International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures)).
