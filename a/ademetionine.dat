40|$|BACKGROUND. Severe burns are {{accompanied}} {{by the development of}} endogenous intoxication syndrome. Endogenous intoxication syndrome (EIS) is thus specified as a complex of severe clinical aspects with detoxification systems failure — in other words, the syndrome of multi-organ failure (MOFS) or inefficiency, depending on severity of EIS (compensation, subcompensation, decompensation) [1, 2]. PURPOSE. To improve the results of EIS and MOFS treatment in the patients with severe burns by including into medication succinic acid-based anti-oxidants combined with hepatoprotectors of the <b>ademetionine</b> group. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We carried out analysis of complex examination and treatment of 108 patients aged 18 – 50 with severe thermal injury, total burn area (S) ≥ 40 %, and severity index ≥ 90. RESULTS. The use of succinic acid-based anti-oxidants within the framework of antishock and disintoxication therapy, later combined with hepatoprotectors of the <b>ademetionine</b> group, decreases the intensity of endogenous intoxication and multi-organ failure syndrome. CONCLUSION. To treat endotoxemia and multiple organ dysfunction caused by oxidative stress and hypoxia in patients with severe and extremely severe burns, it is appropriate to prescribe succinic acid-based anti-oxidants. To prevent albumen synthesis and detoxication hepar dysfunctions, decrease the manifestations of endotoxemia, and complement the cytoprotective action of succinic acid-based antioxidants, it is appropriate to prescribe hepatoprotectors.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{most common}} rheumatic diseases, and {{currently}} there is no effective pharmacological treatment of OA. It {{has been suggested that}} lack of effective treatment is, in part, due to the disease heterogeneity which may lead to development of several OA subtypes (phenotypes). Diabetes-associated OA is among the proposed OA phenotypes. The key mechanism involved into inflammatory and degenerative changes in OA is a decrease in DNA methylation suggested for several cell types, that was also demonstrated in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, pharmacological increase of DNA methylation may be an effective treatment strategy which may exert pleiotropic effects in diabetes-associated OA. In a randomized crossover study, we have evaluated efficacy and safety of <b>ademetionine,</b> a methyl group donor, in comparison with chondroitine sulfate in patients with OA associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patients were randomly assigned to sequential treatment of chondroitine sulfate/ademetionine or ademetionine/chondroitine sulfate during one month, with a washout period of 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was pain measured according to visual analogue scale (VAS). Painful symptoms, as well as function and disease signs in knee, hip and hand joints were also assessed with KOOS, WOMAC, and FIHOA scales. General performance was assessed with SF– 36 scale. To evaluate systemic inflammation, we measured serum IL- 6, IL- 18, adiponectin, and CRP using ELISA technique. Concentrations of serum cartilage destruction biomarkers (aggrecan and antibodies to collagen type II) were assessed by ELISA. Serum lipid levels were measured with standard method; glycated hemoglobin was assessed with liquid chromatography. Ten patients (all women, age 61. 7 - 74. 2 year with BMI of  1. 1 - 38. 4 kg/m 2) were included in the study. It has been demonstrated that <b>ademetionine</b> showed a statistically significant analgetic effect (decrease in VAS pain), improved knee function and reduced symptoms in knee joints (as measured by KOOS subscales), and did not influence the levels of systemic inflammation or cartilage destruction biomarkers. There was also no change in lipid levels and glycated hemoglobin concentrations.  Ademetionine was well tolerated, no serious adverse events occurred during the treatment. In conclusion, ademetionine does not have pleiotropic pharmacological effects in diabetes-associated OA. Its potential application in cases of different comorbidities requires further studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{limited number}} of {{researches}} {{have been reported to}} apply the Arrhenius equation to study the relationship between drugs and its degradation products so far. In the present work, the thermal degradation kinetics of lysine hydrochloride solutions for injection, the special solvent for <b>ademetionine</b> 1, 4 -butanedisulfonate (SAM) for injection, was investigated at selected temperatures and pH values. The main degradation product of lysine was separated, purified, and confirmed as lysine lactam. A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method without derivation was developed for the simultaneous determination of lysine and lysine lactam. The results confirmed that both the lysine degradation and lysine lactam generation followed zero-order reaction kinetics. The degradation and generation rate constants increased with increasing temperatures and decreasing pH values. The temperature-dependent degradation and generation reaction could be sufficiently modeled on the Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of 80. 14 and 83. 22  kJ/mol, respectively. Meanwhile, a linear relationship existed between the amount of lysine degradation and lysine lactam generation since the approximate activation energy. Considering there could be other side effects, we established an upper limit of lysine lactam (500  μg/ml), as the acceptable criteria for stability to estimate the shelf life together with lysine, which made the prediction more accurate and credible. Extrapolation data demonstrated that the lysine hydrochloride solutions for injection could be stable for two years stored at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|Much advertising, {{including}} banners on the Internet,touts {{the purported}} beneficial {{effects of the}} dietary supplement S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe; also called S-adenosylmethionine). Indeed, this supplement has be-come so famous {{that it was the}} focus of a 1999 issue of Newsweek. 1 Despite being essentially unknown in the US supplement market three years ago, SAMe has risen {{to be one of the}} top 25 dietary supplements in a market of more than 13 000 others. What makes this particular dietary sup-plement so popular? Perhaps the myriad of claims sur-rounding its use have helped. SAMe is being commis-sioned by proponents as an antidepressant, an antiarthritic, a nootropic agent, an agent for cholestasis and liver disor-ders, a treatment for migraines, and therapy for fibromyal-gia. In Europe, SAMe is also commonly known as SAM or <b>ademetionine,</b> and by the name AdoMet in Switzerland. 1, 2 PHARMACOLOGY/PHARMACODYNAMICS First described in 1953 by Cantoni, 3 SAMe is naturally synthesized in the body during the metabolism of methio-nine to cysteine, taurine, glutathione, and other polyamine compounds (Figure 1). This biochemical conversion takes place in the presence of methionine-adenosyl-transferase and adenosine triphosphate. Subsequent development of a sensitive and specific assay for SAMe showed that it exists in varying quantities in mammalian cells. Although syn-thesized in many cells, including the brain, the majority of SAMe’s metabolic generation occurs in the liver, where it uses> 70 % of dietary methionine. 4 SAMe functions as a primary methyl group (–CH 3) donor for a broad range o...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} the proportion, causes {{and the nature}} of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in patients with notably elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). METHODS: All the inpatients with ALT levels above 10 times upper limit of normal range (ULN) were retrospectively identified from a computerized clinical laboratory database at our hospital covering a 12 -mo period. Relevant clinical information was obtained from medical records. Alternative causes of ALT elevations were examined for each patient, including biliary abnormality, viral hepatitis, hemodynamic injury, malignancy, DILI or undetermined and other causes. All suspected DILI cases were causality assessed using the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, and only the cases classified as highly probable, probable, or possible were diagnosed as DILI. Comments related to the diagnosis of DILI in the medical record and in the discharge letter for each case were also examined to evaluate DILI detection by the treating doctors. RESULTS: A total of 129 cases with ALT > 10 ULN were identified. Hemodynamic injury (n = 46, 35. 7 %), DILI (n = 25, 19. 4 %) and malignancy (n = 21, 16. 3 %) were the top three causes of liver injury. Peak ALT values were lower in DILI patients than in patients with hemodynamic injury (14. 5 1; 5. 6 ULN vs 32. 5 1; 30. 7 ULN, P = 0. 001). Among DILI patients, one (4 %) case was classified as definite, 19 (76 %) cases were classified as probable and 5 (20 %) as possible according to the CIOMS scale. A hepatocellular pattern was observed in 23 (92 %) cases and mixed in 2 (8 %). The extent of severity of liver injury was mild in 21 (84 %) patients and moderate in 4 (16 %). Before discharge, 10 (40 %) patients were recovered and the other 15 (60 %) were improved. The improved patients tended to have a higher peak ALT (808 1; 348 U/L vs 623 1; 118 U/L, P = 0. 016) and shorter treatment duration before discharge (8 1; 6 d vs 28 1; 12 d, P = 0. 008) compared with the recovered patients. Twenty-two drugs and 6 herbs were found associated with DILI. Antibacterials were the most common agents causing DILI in 8 (32 %) cases, followed by glucocorticoids in 6 (24 %) cases. Twenty-four (96 %) cases received treatment of DILI with at least one adjunctive drug. Agents for treatment of DILI included anti-inflammatory drugs (e. g., glycyrrhizinate), antioxidants (e. g., glutathione, <b>ademetionine</b> 1, 4 -butanedisulfonate and tiopronin), polyene phosphatidyl choline and herbal extracts (e. g., protoporphyrin disodium and silymarin). Diagnosis of DILI was not mentioned in the discharge letter in 60 % of the cases. Relative to prevalent cases and cases from wards of internal medicine, incident cases and cases from surgical wards had a higher risk of missed diagnosis in discharge letter [odds ratio (OR) 32. 7, 95 %CI (2. 8 - 374. 1), and OR 58. 5, 95 %CI (4. 6 - 746. 6), respectively]. CONCLUSION: DILI is mostly caused by use of antibacterials and glucocorticoids, and constitutes about one fifth of hospitalized patients with ALT > 10 ULN. DILI is underdiagnosed frequently...|$|E
