5|$|The Green Bay Packers signed Davis on January 22, 1999, reuniting {{him with}} new Packers coach Ray Rhodes. His tenure with the Packers was short-lived, however, <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> Bay {{released}} him in June.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when {{illuminated by}} blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it <b>as</b> <b>green,</b> and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived <b>as</b> <b>green.</b>|$|E

5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, shrubs and bushes, such <b>as</b> <b>green</b> manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|Chromium oxides {{are also}} used as a green color in glassmaking and as a glaze in ceramics. Green {{chromium}} oxide is extremely light-fast and as such is used in cladding coatings. It is also the main ingredient in infrared reflecting paints, used by the armed forces, to paint vehicles, {{to give them the}} same IR reflectance <b>as</b> <b>green</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> {{and others have}} suggested, Bix often {{felt a sense of}} exhilaration. It was like {{attending}} a music school, learning and broadening: formal music, especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation, so much sought-after in the 1920s, were calling out to him.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Hutson {{had nine}} {{touchdown}} receptions, again setting the league record, {{as he led}} the Packers to another NFL Championship Game, this time against the New York Giants. However, a knee injury he suffered four weeks earlier {{kept him out of}} the game's starting lineup. He entered as a substitute three separate times late in the game but was unable to be a factor, catching no passes <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> Bay was defeated 23â€“17.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 20th century, as disruptively {{patterned}} uniforms became widespread, winter {{variants of}} patterns such as Flecktarn were developed, the background colour (such <b>as</b> <b>green)</b> being replaced with white {{to form a}} Schneetarn (snow camouflage pattern). Aircraft deployed in winter have sometimes been snow camouflaged, as with Sepecat Jaguars on exercise in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Local economies near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaves of}} every species of Capsicum are edible. Though almost all other Solanaceous crops have toxins in their leaves, chili peppers do not. The leaves, which are mildly bitter and {{nowhere near as}} hot as the fruit, are cooked <b>as</b> <b>greens</b> in Filipino cuisine, where they are called dahon ng sili (literally [...] "chili leaves"). They {{are used in the}} chicken soup tinola. In Korean cuisine, the leaves may be used in kimchi. In Japanese cuisine, the leaves are cooked <b>as</b> <b>greens,</b> and also cooked in tsukudani style for preservation.|$|R
50|$|Lei cha {{may also}} {{be taken as a}} dietary brew. In that case, it is served with rice and other {{vegetarian}} side dishes such <b>as</b> <b>greens,</b> tofu, and pickled radish.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{aromatic}} tendency, it is eaten raw or cooked. Raw, {{the leaves}} are eaten <b>as</b> <b>greens,</b> and cooked they are used in condiments, and as a flavoring in soups.|$|R
5|$|The coyote {{feeds on}} a variety of {{different}} produce, including blackberries, blueberries, peaches, pears, apples, prickly pears, chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and carrots. During the winter and early spring, the coyote eats large quantities of grass, such <b>as</b> <b>green</b> wheat blades. It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal droppings, beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and sorghum.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to <b>as</b> <b>green</b> power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose {{to do more than}} policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E

5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another Â£1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{faster and more}} {{aggressive}} styles such as hardcore punk (e.g. Minor Threat), street punk (e.g. the Exploited), and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass) had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued {{a broad range of}} other variations, giving rise to post-punk and new wave and later indie pop, alternative rock, and noise rock. By the 1990s, punk rock had re-emerged in the mainstream, as pop punk bands such <b>as</b> <b>Green</b> Day and the Offspring brought the genre widespread popularity.|$|E
