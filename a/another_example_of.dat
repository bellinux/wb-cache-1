5|$|Nearby and near-contemporary Hohenzollern Castle is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> 19th-century romanticist {{architecture}} {{inspired by}} medieval castles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a {{divergent}} electron {{transport chain}} is the alternative oxidase, which {{is found in}} plants, {{as well as some}} fungi, protists, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity Hall of Xuan Miao Temple (玄妙观), {{situated}} {{in the heart of}} Suzhou city, is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Song architecture. In 1982, it was established as a National Heritage Site by the Chinese government.|$|E

50|$|Hosoya {{index and}} Wiener index are global (integral) indices to {{describe}} entire molecule, Bonchev and Polansky introduced local (differential) index for every atom in a molecule. <b>Another</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> local indices are modifications of Hosoya index.|$|R
50|$|Other {{compounds}} act on molecules {{important for}} the transmission of an action potential from one neuron to <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> these include interfering with receptors for neurotransmitters or the enzymes that remove neurotransmitters not bound to receptors.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> {{an embargo}} is the United States embargo against Cuba. This {{is still an}} ongoing embargo, and, due to the declining {{situation}} and health of Cuba's people, the embargo has been subject to much protest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in}} the figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are actually}} assemblies of multiple polypeptide chains. The quaternary structure {{refers to the}} number and arrangement of the protein subunits with respect to one <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, and ion channels.|$|R

5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5|$|Averianov, Archibald, and Martin instead placed UA 8699 in {{the context}} of faunal {{similarity}} and exchange between the late Cretaceous faunas of Europe and Africa, noting the presence of similar animals, such as snakes (Medtsoia) and sauropods (Lirainosaurus and Repetosaurus), in the Cretaceous faunas of Madagascar and the Spanish locality Laño. They proposed the relationship between Lainodon, which is from Laño, and UA 8699 as <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this relationship and cited a previous prediction by Gheerbrant and Astibia that zhelestids similar to Lainodon would be found in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{gained a}} home in {{television}} in the 1960s animated sitcom The Flintstones, in <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case). Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok, where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting more scientific accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's The Dinosaur Book (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|In <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although {{in this case}} he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|Lacking an infield {{lighting}} system, {{cars were}} driven inside the stadium to illuminate {{it for the}} last two events of the decathlon. The cycling tandem event, which was held in the dark, was <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the main venue's lighting issues. After the Games it was used as the English national football stadium, hosting numerous concerts and sporting events, including the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and the British leg of Live Aid in 1985. It was closed in 2000, and demolished three years later to allow the construction of the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{cells are}} <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> {{specialized}} cells that contain {{an abundance of}} smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> known <b>example</b> <b>of</b> an {{alkaline}} phosphatase inhibitor is (4-Nitrophenyl)methylphosphonic acid.|$|R

5|$|Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, {{also built}} by Christian IV, is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch Renaissance style. In 1606, the king first had a two-storey summerhouse {{built on a}} site he used as a park for relaxation. He then decided to start work on a much more ambitious building, the castle, which {{developed}} in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624. Predating the castle, the Renaissance-style park, is Denmark's oldest royal garden.|$|E
5|$|Still, {{the centre}} hosts some {{examples}} of modern architecture {{dating back to the}} Communist era. The Hungarian Theatre building was erected {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, but underwent an avant-garde renovation in 1961, when it acquired a modernist style of architecture. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> modernist architectural art is Palatul Telefoanelor, situated in the vicinity of Mihai Viteazul Square, an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings.|$|E
5|$|The larger French {{specimen}} (MNHN CNJ 79) {{was discovered}} by quarry owner Louis Ghirardi around 1971 in the Portlandian lithographic limestone of Canjuers near Nice in southeastern France. It dates to the lower Tithonian. Although Alain Bidar originally described the specimen as a separate species called Compsognathus corallestris, Ostrom, Jean-Guy Michard and others have since relabeled it as <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Compsognathus longipes. Quimby identified the smaller German specimen as a juvenile of the same species. In 1983, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris acquired the French Compsognathus fossil; Michard thoroughly studied it there.|$|E

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to}} see at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in San Francisco {{after having}} been {{released}} from questioning by immigration officials on Angel Island on 11 August 1918, Prokofiev was soon compared to other famous Russian exiles (such as Sergei Rachmaninoff). His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements. He also received a contract from the {{music director of the}} Chicago Opera Association, Cleofonte Campanini, for the production of his new opera The Love for Three Oranges; however, due to Campanini's illness and death, the premiere was postponed. The delay was <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Prokofiev's bad luck in operatic matters. The failure also cost him his American solo career since the opera took too much time and effort. He soon found himself in financial difficulties, and in April 1920, he left for Paris, not wanting to return to Russia as a failure.|$|E
