Re-cently, <b>attractive</b> <b>prices</b> (also known as price points) have often been referred to as one important potential explanation of nominal rigidities. An increased interest on <b>attractive</b> <b>prices</b> as an explanation for price ri-gidities rests on online pricing, in the context of which {{it has been shown that}} prices are rigid also on the internet, where physical costs are not important. Our empirical analyses using micro data on consumer prices in Finland indicate that a specific form of <b>attractive</b> <b>prices</b> – 9 -ending prices – have a considerable effect on pricing dynamics. The results of the study show that changes to prices with 9 endings are more often decreases than are changes to prices with other endings. Price changes to 9 -ending prices are also of smaller size than are changes to other endings. rigidity; <b>price</b> endings; <b>attractive</b> prices; 9 -prices...|$|R

40|$|Currently, nearly 90 % of all {{prices of}} {{consumer}} goods and services in the Netherlands are psychological, conveniently broken or round prices. After converting these `attractive' guilder prices into euro using the official conversion rate, the resulting euro prices are generally not attractive. The Dutch public is concerned that retailers will not round their euro prices symmetrically upwards and downwards to the next <b>attractive</b> <b>pricing</b> point but only upwards? This paper investigates the question `What would be {{the effect on the}} consumer price index (CPI) if prices were systematically rounded upwards'. Firstly, the <b>attractive</b> <b>pricing</b> points are determined empirically using the actual price sample underlying the Dutch CPI. Secondly, different rounding scenarios are investigated and the likelihood of the worst-case scenario is discussed. It turns out that the euro introduction may cause an increase of the CPI by 0. 7 % at most. However, due to competition in the retail sector, this scenario is very unlikely.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether the price adjustment process in Austria has changed since the changeover to euro notes and coins at the beginning of 2002. For this purpose, we analyze the frequency and size of price adjustments, sectoral and seasonal differences as well as the structure of prices (notably the share of <b>attractive</b> <b>prices)</b> on the basis of micro price observations underlying the Austrian Consumer Price Index (CPI). A data set spanning the period from 1996 to mid- 2006 was used for the analysis. In addition to confirming known results from previous studies – i. e. that price adjustments occur roughly once per year on average, but with strong sectoral differences – our study reveals an unchanged seasonal pattern of price adjustments, with major peaks in January, also after the cash changeover. At the time of the changeover itself, the observed price changes were more frequent but smaller than usual. As upward and downward price adjustments were also roughly balanced, the cash changeover appears to have had no significant overall inflationary effects, confirming previous studies. The share of <b>attractive</b> <b>prices</b> (i. e. prices ending in 9 or 90, and even prices), which was over 60 % before the cash changeover, plummeted to just over 20 % in early 2002. In the course of the ensuing three to four years, however, this share again approached the level observed prior to the transition. From these results we conclude that price-setting habits as well as the structure of Austrian consumer prices has not changed significantly since the cash changeover.

40|$|Approximately 70 % of Belgian {{consumer}} prices {{are to be}} considered as <b>attractive</b> <b>prices,</b> namely psychological prices, fractional prices - i. e. prices which are convenient to pay - and round prices. Conversion of these prices into euro generally leads to prices which are no longer attractive {{and it is very}} likely that retailers will round their <b>prices</b> to <b>attractive</b> euro <b>prices.</b> The public fears that rounding will be upward rather than symmetric. This paper simulates in the first instance a worst-case scenario, whereby all <b>attractive</b> BEF <b>prices</b> are systematically rounded up to the nearest <b>attractive</b> euro <b>price.</b> The effect on the consumer price index ranges from 0. 54 to 0. 72 %. Such a scenario is however very unlikely, as factors such as competition on product markets, the currently prevailing demand conditions, the commitments made by organisations representing the enterprise sector and the vigilant attitude of consumers restrain the possibility of rounding up. In order to obtain a more realistic picture, the paper investigates in a second step whether rounding-up effects were found after the major change in VAT rates in April 1992. These effects seem marginal, although it should be acknowledged that it was difficult to isolate rounding effects from regular price changes. Any ex post assessment of the euro changeover will face a similar identification problem. ...|$|R
