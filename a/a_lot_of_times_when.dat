50|$|In a November 6, 2010, interview, McMahon {{admitted}} to having memory problems due to injuries suffered on the football field. McMahon was quoted as saying, 'There are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I {{walk into a room}} and forget why I walked in there.' McMahon, along with six other retired professional football players, filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL in August 2011, citing the league's negligence and misconduct in its handling of concussion-related injuries; the suit followed lawsuits filed shortly before by 75 other NFL retirees making similar claims as well as asserting that the NFL knew about the dangers concussions posed to NFL athletes {{as far back as the}} 1920s and actively withheld the information from the affected and the general public until the summer of 2010. The August suit that McMahon joined seeks to expand the scope of the suit to potentially all NFL players who suffered game-related concussions or head injuries.|$|E
5000|$|Sportscaster Mike Roberts was the [...] "Voice of the Lobos" [...] on KKOB {{radio in}} Albuquerque from 1966 to 2008, {{becoming}} an icon among Lobo fans.

Roberts noted the noise level in The Pit as a challenge for a broadcaster: [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I knew I was calling the game because my lips were moving, but I couldn't hear a thing I said." [...] Many fans were disappointed and outraged when Roberts was dismissed by KKOB in 2008. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson declared May 8, 2008 as [...] "Mike Roberts Appreciation Day" [...] in honor of the sportscaster. In 1999, Roberts was inducted into the University of New Mexico Athletic Hall of Honor by the Alumni Lettermen's Association and received the Distinguished Service Award.

5000|$|In 2007, Dylan {{appeared}} on several tribute albums, including Endless Highway: The Music of The Band and Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, a charity album consisting of covers of John Lennon songs. On Endless Highway, Dylan performed {{a cover of}} The Band's [...] "Whispering Pines." [...] For Instant Karma, Dylan performed a cover of Lennon's [...] "Gimme Some Truth," [...] with Dhani Harrison contributing backing vocals on the song.In September 2007, it was reported by The New York Times that Dylan was recording his first solo album at producer, Rick Rubin's home in the Hollywood Hills. [...] Regarding its sparse instrumentation and production, Dylan described {{the differences in the}} writing process for Seeing Things, compared to writing for the Wallflowers: [...] <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you write songs, you’re aware that this line is just going to help you get to the next line and someone's probably going to do an organ fill right there anyway - you can let those go. But with something like this, it was just three instruments, really; vocals being one of the instruments, which then makes the lyrics being one of the instruments. You’re more aware that {{things are going to be}} more exposed and you can’t really let anything go unless you’re confident that this is what you want to say. Following the completion of recording in 2007, Seeing Things was released on June 10, 2008. [...] The album received generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.24 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. [...] Following the release of Seeing Things, Dylan made several television appearances to promote the album and toured with a backing band called The Gold Mountain Rebels, which consisted of Wallflowers drummer Fred Eltringham, guitarist Audley Freed and bassist George Reif. In the summer and fall of 2008, Dylan and the Gold Mountain Rebels played a combination of theaters and festivals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including Farm Aid in Mansfield, Massachusetts and the Newport Folk Festival. In addition to touring with the Gold Mountain Rebels, Dylan and Eltringham also performed several shows with the Wallflowers in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm {{starting}} to realise, {{the more that}} I'm writing, that independence is a recurring theme in my songs. I am quite an independent person. It’s one of [...] things where {{if you want something}} done sometimes it’s better to do it yourself. When I moved to London, I was nineteen and didn’t know a lot of people. Doing DJ gigs meant I'd be getting trains at 10pm to get to work and then at 3am to come back. I’d be sitting in Kings Cross stationwith a coffee from the 24 hour Starbucks myself. I've never been one of those people with tag alongs or anything. I just sort of get on with it really. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you are yourself, sitting there, {{you have a lot of}} time to reflect and think about what you are doing and you realise how isolated the business can be. That is what my song was about and indeed what a lot of my other songs have been inspired by." [...] —Yasmin speaking to Natasha Reid of The Banter about the song. [...] At the age of 17, Yasmin began DJ-ing in Glasgow where there was little opportunity of success for her. In a January 2011 report by Mikey McMonagle of the Daily Record, she mentioned, [...] "I would never be the person I am if I had not started there." [...] Yasmin honed her passion for music as a DJ in Glasgow where she played at night clubs such as Kushion and The Tunnel. She continued as a DJ there, even though her shifts were long and earnings low. BBC Radio 1 Xtra got in touch with Yasmin to ask her to develop a song for their homegrown podcast. This inspired Yasmin to quit her physiotherapy degree and move to London to pursue her musical career. She then established herself as a DJ in London at private parties and a support act for the tours of Dizzee Rascal, N.E.R.D, will.i.am, Taio Cruz and Eve. In the Daily Record report, she admitted that it was her London surroundings and the encouragement of Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D which gave her the confidence to want to launch a solo career:"I always wrote songs but there wasn't much of a scene for the music I was into - the hip hop and urban stuff. Then I moved to London and ended up making a name for myself and meeting people like Pharrell. I mentioned to a few of these guys that I write music, played some to them and they told me I had something. Of course seeing these people spurred me on. Being in London makes everything so much closer. I could see in front of me where I wanted to be. It really gives you drive and ambition as you can see the goal." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News on March 24, 2010, Hilson revealed that her trip to Africa had heavily influenced the album's sound. She told the interviewer [...] "Everywhere I travel, I get music from that region of the world. I've been to Nigeria, I've been to South Africa, three cites in Africa all. I gather music from these regions, and African music is very drum-heavy. It was very inspiring. I'm {{definitely going to be}} using some of that inspiration." [...] When Hilson was interviewed by Global Grind in August 2010, she explained that she was excited about the album's release, because it would be inspirational to all women, stating:"I really wanted to do an album to tell women to be confident, no matter what their circumstances. You have to push through, don't yield {{at the first sign of}} adversity. The theme of this event is celebrating the journey and not the success. My personal journey was over 12 years long. I had to sit back and be a songwriter when my first goal was to be an artist. I know a lot of women who just have given up, so I want them to have the same tenacity and drive that men have. I really went there on this album." [...] When asked, by Allison Walker from Central Florida News 13, who was the inspiration behind the songs' lyrics?, Hilson replied [...] "Many, many boys. Many, many, many boys. Even the boys in your life inspired this. I was in an imaginary clubhouse. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I was sitting down to write, and I was in an imaginary clubhouse, you were there, Allison. My best friends. Your best friends. Our sisters, our mothers we were all sounding off and yelling at the top of our lungs everything we wish men knew about us. And, uh, so that's really what motivated a lot of the records." [...] Although the album is called No Boys Allowed, Hilson told Lisa Binkert of Billboard magazine that [...] "I have all male features on the album, but they're all men. Not boys ... I wanted to represent the male point of view. I'm not saying it's always good, but I want you to be honest; the same way that I'm honest about female's perspective. I wanted men to come and sound off." [...] Hilson has stated in {{an interview}} with Perez Hilton that the album's title actually means, No Bullshit Allowed. She released a statement on her website about the title saying, [...] "it's not about excluding men. It's more about women understanding that there comes a time in your life when you want a man. A real man. A grown up. Not a boy. And that's not a bad thing." [...] The deluxe edition of No Boys Allowed had a slightly different album cover. The image, which is the same as the standard edition cover, appears in color against a pink tinged background.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Many {{techniques}} in Computer Graphics and Animation need to detect collisions between {{two or more}} objects. For complicated object-models, it is often very dicult to detect collisions with the existing model parameters and primitives. But, in many cases it might be sucient {{to come up with}} a conservative estimate of whether a collision occured or not. By conservative, the idea is that two objects very close to each other (but not actually colliding) may be identied as colliding but two actually colliding objects should never be able to escape without being detected. An approach to accomplish this is to generate a bounding body of the object, which completely encloses it and is so dened/parametrized that detecting collisions against the bounding body is relatively simple. An example of such a bounding body is the bounding box for the object. Although such a box would always detect a collision whenever it occurs, it would also detect it <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> it does n...|$|E

I really asked [students] to pay close attention to land [...] .

For Hawaiian students it was more of this genealogical connectedness to places and for students who are not Hawaiian, a greater sense of their own kuleana or responsibility [...] . I think engagement goes hand in hand with kuleana. If you feel like you have some kind of commitment or responsibility, the writing comes through in a much more engaged way. I work in Waiʻanae and there's a place where Maui was born in Lualualei [...] . There are these mountains, and they say if you really look at the mountains, they look like thighs. And if you think about the river, it's like a birth canal. In different tours we've done, the land comes alive like that, where you see the moʻolelo being enacted and performed through the landscape. You see the moʻolelo taking place and unfolding as you're traveling geographically. Some of [these moʻolelo] can be read on a metaphorical level, but many of them are very literally about the stories that are unfolding along the landscape, and you have to pay attention to the land to understand those stories and for it to have that kind of special relevance for you. Passion comes into [one student's] writing in the way that she explores the moʻolelo from so many different angles, not just its textual relevance, but its geographical relevance. The land has its own ontology. Its writing its own story...|$|E
