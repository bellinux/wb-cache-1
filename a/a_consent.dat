5|$|In 1999, then-Emir (now King) Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa began {{a reform}} process and in 2001 exiles {{were told they}} could come back. Rejecting an offer to become a cabinet {{minister}} and leaving his leading position in the opposition, al-Jamri returned from the United Kingdom in December 2001, eight months after his father had obtained <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> from the Emir to establish two newspapers. Initially, he was sceptical about the king's reform plan, but al-Jamri received a personal invitation by the king and was given a large margin of freedom of expression. Al-Jamri, backed by 39 other private investors (US$5.3 million capital) had initially planned to establish two independent newspapers, Al-Wasat in Arabic and Gulf Observer in English.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{a special}} {{procedure}} {{is required to}} obtain the pharmaceutical. In most other countries, <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> form is required which explains these risks. Women taking isotretinoin must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy. Sexual abstinence or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., condoms) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable failure rates of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on isotretinoin therapy are generally counselled to have a termination. Isotretinoin {{has no effect on}} male fertility.|$|E

Even after the decree, all Ivy League schools continue to award aid on financial need without offering any athletic scholarships.

25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after the Rodney King beating, in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> decree. Police reform has since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E

25|$|Under its new {{permitting}} process Tent City 4 {{was limited}} by the City of Bellevue to 40 residents and 60 days duration.

The parties negotiated <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> decree where TC4 and its supporters acknowledged that Bellevue was within its rights to adopt these code changes in exchange for allowing TC4 to stay 90 days at the Temple and St Luke's sites in Bellevue and agreeing not to return to the city for one year.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, city {{authorities}} {{started an}} investigation against Agriprocessors due to complaints from local residents {{that the firm}} routinely deposited untreated effluent into local rivers in breach of regulations.

Untreated wastewater from abattoirs is a heavy burden on wastewater treatment plants because of its high biochemical oxygen demand and high concentration of FOG (Fats, oils, and grease) which can form insoluble plaques in sewage pipes.|$|E

In 1932 they accepted <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> agreement which removed the restrictions established by the cross-licensing agreements, and also provided that RCA would become a fully independent company. As a result, GE and Westinghouse gave up their ownership interests in RCA, while RCA was allowed to keep its factories. In order to give RCA a chance to establish itself, GE and Westinghouse were required to refrain from competing in the radio business {{for the next two}} and one-half years.|$|E
