5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his heir <b>apparent,</b> he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the heir <b>apparent,</b> known as the Grand Tutor of the Heir <b>Apparent</b> (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of the Heir <b>Apparent</b> (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the Heir <b>Apparent</b> lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the heir <b>apparent</b> were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of the Heir <b>Apparent.</b> If he reached adulthood, the heir <b>apparent</b> could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E

5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main <b>apparent</b> motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an <b>apparent</b> diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the <b>apparent</b> sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|$|E
5|$|As {{seen from}} Earth, Kepler-4 has an <b>apparent</b> {{magnitude}} of 12.7. It is, as a result, not visible {{with the naked}} eye.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of 613 parsecs, Kepler-11d has an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 14.2. It is, thus, not visible with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have <b>apparent</b> magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able {{to be seen as a}} separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of <b>apparent</b> magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.|$|E

5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an <b>apparent</b> {{magnitude}} (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the naked eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was <b>apparent,</b> {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most <b>apparent</b> RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10 has an <b>apparent</b> {{magnitude}} of 11.2, {{which means that}} the star is invisible to the naked eye from the perspective of an observer on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11 has an <b>apparent</b> {{magnitude}} of 14.2. It is too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40 lies 2700 parsecs (8,806.4 light years) {{away from}} Earth, further than any star (with a known distance) with an {{exoplanet}} previously discovered by Kepler. With an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 14.58, {{it was also}} dimmer than any star previously recognized by Kepler. Because of its low <b>apparent</b> magnitude, Kepler-40 cannot be seen with the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|Lambda Tucanae is {{an optical}} double—that is, {{the name is}} given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear close {{together}} from our viewpoint, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda1 is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of spectral type F7IV-V and an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of <b>apparent</b> magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The <b>apparent</b> {{brightness}} {{of a star}} is {{expressed in terms of}} its <b>apparent</b> magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the <b>apparent</b> magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E

5|$|The <b>apparent</b> {{magnitude}} (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means}} {{that it is not}} visible to the naked eye. It is slightly dimmer than Neptune, which has an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E
5|$|The {{last heir}} <b>apparent</b> to the French throne to be crowned during his father's {{lifetime}} was the future Philip II, while the only crowned heir <b>apparent</b> to the English throne was Henry the Young King, who was first crowned alone {{and then with}} his wife, Margaret of France. The practice was eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger. The last coronation of an heir <b>apparent,</b> {{with the exception of}} investitures of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, was the coronation of the future Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria as junior King of Hungary in 1830.|$|E
5|$|The motions as {{described}} above are simplifications. Due to the movement of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the <b>apparent</b> path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with {{a period of about}} one month. Due to further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion. The ecliptic is actually the <b>apparent</b> path of the Sun throughout the course of a year.|$|E

5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous <b>apparent</b> magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its <b>apparent</b> magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an <b>apparent</b> magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting <b>apparent</b> magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the <b>apparent</b> magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E
