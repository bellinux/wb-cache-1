50|$|On February 9, 2009, MRU {{filed for}} Chapter 7 {{bankruptcy}} liquidation and suspended all operations. The company received a payment <b>acceleration</b> <b>notice</b> from Longview Marquis Master Fund LP {{due to the}} breach of a loan covenant. The covenant called for MRU to reduce their receivables by $5 million by January 28, 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, {{he went to}} America as an {{international}} student where he devised his seismic theory of the earthquake-proof wall. While on the First Transcontinental Railroad, he made observations about {{the movements of the}} luggage depending on the trains <b>acceleration</b> after <b>noticing</b> the scattered trunks when the train made sudden stops. The lack of partitions in the luggage compartment and the disarray of the trunks led him to the structural idea of the earthquake-proof wall, effectively a shear wall.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} affecting the crack propagation rate for fatigue cracks exposed to an overload, an in situ {{scanning electron microscope}} technique was used, together with potential drop measurements. High-resolution images were analysed with an image analysis program to measure the displacements along the crack, and the potential drop technique was employed to measure the electrical contact between the fatigue crack surfaces. The crack closure level could, by image analysis, be determined as close as 1 Î¼m from the crack tip. The indications from the image analysis pointed towards a somewhat lower closure load {{as compared to the}} potential drop technique. The effect of an overload on the crack propagation rate was found to depend on the magnitude of the overload in combination with the steady-state conditions. Both overload induced crack retardation and crack <b>acceleration</b> was <b>noticed</b> to occur. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R
50|$|Both Pioneer {{spacecraft}} are {{escaping the}} Solar System, but are slowing {{under the influence}} of the Sun's gravity. Upon very close examination of navigational data, the spacecraft were found to be slowing slightly more than expected. The effect is an extremely small acceleration towards the Sun, of , which is equivalent to a reduction of the outbound velocity by 1 km/h over a period of ten years. The two spacecraft were launched in 1972 and 1973 and the anomalous <b>acceleration</b> was first <b>noticed</b> as early as 1980, but not seriously investigated until 1994. The last communication with either spacecraft was in 2003, but analysis of recorded data continues.|$|R
