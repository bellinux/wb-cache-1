25|$|After Coral Sea, the loaned pilots {{returned}} to VF-3. However, with Lexington sunk and VF-2 attached to Saratoga, VF-3 was now effectively homeless. In the interim it operated out of Pearl as a training unit. Jimmy Thach passed command to Butch O'Hare on 24 June 1942, making him CO, and O'Hare subsequently appointed Vorse as his Executive Officer (XO). Vorse wouldn't stay put {{more than a}} couple of weeks, however. The Navy was in the midst of a major reshuffling of fighter squadrons, including a move from twenty-seven to thirty-six plane squadrons as a standard complement. In the post-Midway milieu, fighter-starved air groups were actively recruiting from squadrons like O'Hare's VF-3. Champing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> to get back out to sea, Vorse took Capt. James M. Shoemaker up on an offer to join VF-6. Only 6 July 1942 Vorse was transferred; nine days later VF-6 would depart with USS Enterprise, a part of Task Force 16 under the command of Admiral Kinkaid.|$|E

500|$|To mark Bondfield's centenary in 1973, Linda Christmas in The Guardian {{reviewed}} {{the progress of}} women in parliament since the 1930s. By 1973, Christmas reported, only 93 women had sat in parliament; their contributions had overall [...] "not been stunning". Their best numerical representation at that point {{had been in the}} 1966 general election, when 29 women (out of 630 MPs) had been elected. The 1979 election saw this number fall to 19, but also saw Margaret Thatcher become Britain's first woman prime minister. Cox and Hobley draw attention to Thatcher's early life as a shopkeeper's daughter, and contrast her account of those days with Bondfield's experiences half a century earlier. Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute; thus, Cox and Hobley assert, she would have had little sympathy for Bondfield's campaigns to better shopworkers' conditions. Despite the changes that have taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield's day, Cox and Hobley believe that, were she alive, [...] "she'd still be champing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit,</b> trying to coax shop assistants to join a union, and fiercely championing shopworkers' rights to better pay and conditions".|$|E

[...] This behavior is sometimes accompanied by head-tossing or pawing at the ground. [...] Because this behavior was most often seen {{by the general public}} in horses who were anxious to begin a horse race {{in the days before the}} invention of the starting gate, the term has become popular in everyday speech to refer to a person who is anxious to get started or to do something.

[...] Despite speculation {{that it would be}} the intro to the album, Gaskarth clarified that it was [...] "more of an ending to the story. We pulled a [...] Tarantino." [...] On February 14, while on tour, the band played a new song entitled [...] "Time-Bomb". On February 16, Gaskarth stated that the [...] "record's definitely not coming out in March" [...] due to the [...] "restructuring" [...] of Interscope Records and a number of records have been pushed back, Dirty Work being one of them. In a later interview, Gaskarth presumed [...] "a bunch of people got fired. We {{just wanted to make sure}} we didn't get caught up in that shit storm essentially, so we decided to hold off on putting the record out." [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] was made available for streaming on February 26. In March, the band went on a UK tour alongside Yellowcard and Young Guns. In mid-March, Barakat stated in an interview with AbsolutePunk that All Time Low will [...] "hopefully be releasing the track-listing shortly, maybe even clips of every song."
