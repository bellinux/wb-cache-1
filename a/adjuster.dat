40|$|Peptic {{ulcer disease}} (PUD) {{is a common}} disorder, but whether an {{association}} exists between PUD and anthropometric indicators remains controversial. Furthermore, no studies on the association of PUD with anthropometric indices, blood parameters, and nutritional components have been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess associations of anthropometrics, blood parameters, nutritional components, and lifestyle factors with PUD in the Korean population. Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of the South Korean population using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of anthropometrics, blood parameters and nutritional components among patients with PUD. Age was the factor most strongly associated with PUD in women (p = < 0. 0001, odds ratio (OR) = 0. 770 [0. 683 - 0. 869]) and men (p = < 0. 0001, OR = 0. 715 [0. 616 - 0. 831]). In both crude and <b>adjusted</b> analyses, PUD was highly associated with weight (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0008, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 251 [95 %CI: 1. 098 - 1. 426]), hip circumference (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 005, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 198 [1. 056 - 1. 360]), and body mass index (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0001, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 303 [1. 139 - 1. 490]) in women and hip circumference (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0199, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 217 [1. 031 - 1. 435]) in men. PUD was significantly associated with intake of fiber (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0386, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 157 [1. 008 - 1. 328], vitamin B 2 (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0477, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 155 [1. 001 - 1. 333]), sodium (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0154, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 191 [1. 034 - 1. 372]), calcium (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0079, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 243 [1. 059 - 1. 459]), and ash (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0468, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 152 [1. 002 - 1. 325] in women but not in men. None of the assessed blood parameters were associated with PUD in women, and only triglyceride level was associated with PUD in men (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0169, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 227 [1. 037 - 1. 451]).

The aerodynamic spreaders are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum spreader bars. They precisely fit the spreader bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds.

The crew then cut the rig off, put out a No 3 headsil as a sea anchor and bailed her out while other yachts stood nearby. They managed to start the engine and motored into Eden.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{objective}} of this post hoc exploratory analysis {{was to examine the}} relationship between age and measures of cortical excitability and inhibition. Methods: Forty-six participants (24 with major depressive disorder and 22 healthy controls) completed MT, SICI, ICF, and CSP testing in a cross-sectional protocol. Of these 46 participants, 33 completed LICI testing. Multiple linear robust regression and Spearman partial correlation coefficient were used {{to examine the relationship between}} age and the TMS measures. Results: In the overall sample of 46 participants, age had a significant negative relationship with motor threshold in both the right (rs = - 0. 49, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 007; β= - 0. 08, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) and left (rs = - 0. 42, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 029; β= - 0. 05, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 004) hemispheres.

In the sample of the 33 participants who completed LICI testing, age had a significant negative relationship with LICI (200 millisecond interval) in both the right (rs = - 0. 48, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 05; β= - 0. 24, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 007) and left (rs = - 0. 64, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 002; β= - 0. 23, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) hemispheres. This negative relationship between age and LICI (200 millisecond interval) was also observed in depressed youth in both the right (rs = - 0. 76, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 034; β= - 0. 35, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 004) and left (rs = - 0. 92, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 002; β= - 0. 25, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) hemispheres. Conclusion: These findings suggest that younger children have higher motor thresholds. This is more pronounced in depressed youth than healthy controls. LICI inhibition may also increase with age in youth...|$|R
