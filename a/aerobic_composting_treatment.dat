40|$|The {{influence}} of high temperature <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting</b> <b>treatment</b> on {{the change of}} heavy metal combined form in pig manure was studied using Tessier sequential extraction method. After <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting</b> <b>treatment,</b> the total concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, As in pig manure increased. The concentrations of residual forms increased generally; only the concentrations of sulfide and organic combined form As and Zn decreased. The concentrations of exchangeable form Cu, Zn, Cr and As decreased markedly. Composting treatment could decrease the distribution coefficients of exchangeable form and carbonate form Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, As and Fe-Mn oxides combined form Pb, Cu, Cr and As. Therefore, it could decrease the effectiveness of heavy metals in pig manure.

40|$|AbstractSulfonamides (SAs) is {{one kind}} of the most {{important}} pharmaceuticals occurring in the environment. As the food additive, an increase application of SAs in the production of livestock and poultry leads to amounts of SAs excreted in manure, resulting in persistent environment pollution. Our research aimed to study the effects of some conditioners(sawdust, rice straw) on SAs degradation during the <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting</b> of animal manure. The experiments were conducted for 10 manure <b>composting</b> <b>treatments</b> as follow: hog manure, 10 mg·kg- 1 SAs; hog manure+sawdust, 10 mg·kg- 1 SAs; hog manure+rice straw, 10 mg·kg- 1 SAs; hog manure, 20 mg·kg- 1 SAs; hog manure+sawdust, 20 mg·kg- 1 SAs; hog manure+rice straw, 20 mg/kg SAs; Chicken manure, 10 mg·kg- 1 SAs; Chicken manure+sawdust, 10 mg·kg- 1 SAs; Chicken manure, 20 mg·kg- 1 SAs; Chicken manure+sawdust, 20 mg·kg- 1 SAs. The degradation of four SAs,sulfamerazine(SM 1),sulfachlorpyridazine(SCP), sulfadimoxine(SDM′), Sulfaquinoxaline(SQ) were evaluated. The results showed that over 60 % of 4 kinds of SAs were degraded in 35 d of <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting.</b> Significant degradation of SM 1, SCP, SDM′, SQ were showed in treatments using conditioners than using manure alone. The reduction of 4 kinds of SAs ranged from 62. 30 to 100 % in all six <b>treatments</b> in <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting,</b> and the highest degraded rates were observed in six hog manure treatments with adding rice straws.

40|$|Introduction. Pilot plant {{study of}} {{anaerobic}} composting {{of the organic}} fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Isfahan was performed using sequential batch system. The anaerobic composting were compared with the conventional <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting</b> of MSW using windrow system in 1998 - 99. &# 13; Methods. An experimental study was performed on samples of household refuses, anaerobic <b>composts,</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>composts</b> and leachate of anaerobic composts. Inert materials, heavy metals concentration and physical characteristics of anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>composts</b> were compared. &# 13; Results. There was not significant difference between physical and chemical characteristics of anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting.</b> The study showed that the heavy metals concentration in the anaerobic compost was less than <b>aerobic</b> <b>compost</b> and inert materials in both composts were more than standard concentration. &# 13; Discussion. Sequential batch anaerobic composting (SEBAC) system is stable and has a good flexibility for organic materials with high total solids and a good way for MSWs composting. Amounts of heavy metals (e. g. Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Fe, Cd) in compost of the separated municipal solid wastes were low and about the standard ranges, but in the compost of unseparated MSWs {{were significantly higher than}} standard compost (P < 0. 05).

30|$|Increasing K uptake in <b>compost</b> <b>treatments</b> {{is due to}} an {{increase}} in the availability of potassium in media by addition of peanut shell compost. Calcium uptake increased in <b>compost</b> <b>treatments</b> due to the higher yield of these treatments, compared to the control. The decrease in Ca uptake in the 100  % <b>compost</b> <b>treatment</b> was due to the lower yield of plant than in the control. Manganese uptake increased in 15  % compost and then decreased in other treatments of peanut shell compost in proportion to the applied compost. This increase was due to the higher yield of plants when compared with the control, while the subsequent decrease was due to the decreasing Mn concentration in leaves (Mn concentration in leaves was 258.1, 204.2, 74.2, 53.7, 32.2 and 32.1  mg/kg, respectively, in the control and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 100  % of plants with peanut shell compost). Magnesium uptake decreased in <b>compost</b> <b>treatments</b> compared to the control, whereas it increased in the 100  % <b>compost</b> <b>treatment.</b> This may have been due to ionic competition and the interaction effect between Ca and Mg. The increase of Fe uptake in 30 and 60  % <b>compost</b> <b>treatments,</b> compared to the control, was due to the higher yield of plants with these treatments. The highest zinc uptake was observed for the 60  % <b>compost</b> <b>treatment,</b> which may have been due to the higher concentration of Zn in the shoots of plants compared to other treatments (58.21  mg/kg).|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} evaluated {{an innovative}} anaerobic/aerobic {{process for the}} treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The complete experimental set-up includes a combination of an acidogenic batch reactor and a methanogenic filter. The effluent from the acidogenic reactor was fed into the methanogenic reactor through a holding/recycling tank. The experimental study was conducted by altering the operating conditions, including input total solids (TS), number of batch reactors in series, biomass seeding ratio (BSR), effluent recycle rate, solid waste retention time (SWRT), and pH in the holding/recycling tank. Operating conditions of the methanogenic filter were kept constant throughout the study. The substrate was introduced into the combined system by routinely alternating the batch feed to the acidogenic reactor. The optimum operating conditions, in terms of the highest TS and TVS destruction and the greatest methane production, were determined. The system was operated in a constant-temperature room at 35 °C;At the end an operating period, or half SWRT, the digested wastes was removed from the acidogenic phase. In the meanwhile, free liquid was drained into the holding/recycling tank. Air at a temperature of 25 °C was then pumped into the drained acidogenic reactor at a controlled rate to initiate <b>aerobic</b> <b>composting,</b> and, simultaneously, to dry the digested solid wastes;The system achieved a volatile solids destruction averaging 53 % (90. 4 % of the biodegradable fraction of the solid wastes).

The most promising strategies to improve the municipal solid waste management system include minimization of the amount of solid wastes generated, maximization of waste recycling as well as resource recovery (Mbuligwe et al. 2002). The application of compost to the agricultural land is a low-cost alternative to open landfill disposal or incineration (Bruun et al. 2006).
