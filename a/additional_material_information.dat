40|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional rapid prototyping of homogeneous objects, fabrication of heterogeneous objects (using layered manufacturing technologies) requires <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> <b>information</b> to be incorporated {{along with the}} object's geometries. The paper presents relevant data structures and algorithms for virtual prototyping of heterogeneous objects. Heterogeneous CAD models, which represent the ideal digital heterogeneous objects, are first described. Interrogation of the material compositions from the CAD models is then carried out at runtime. Voxels (with location-specific material properties) are subsequently created and maintained in a dynamic scan-line structure, layered-section structure and the virtual-object structure. The proposed data structures and the associate algorithms have been successfully applied in virtually prototyping of heterogeneous objects. Virtually fabricated heterogeneous object examples are provided. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{corporate}} practice, {{incentive schemes}} are often complicated even for simple tasks. Hence, {{the way they}} are communicated might matter. In a controlled field experiment, we study a minimally invasive change in the communication of a well-established incentive scheme - a reminder regarding the piece rate {{at the beginning of the}} shift. The experiment was conducted in a large firm where experienced managers work in a team production setting and where incentives for both quantity and quality of output are provided. While the treatment conveyed no <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> <b>information</b> and left the incentive system unchanged, it had significant positive effects on quantity and on managers' compensation. These effects are economically sizable and robust to alternative empirical specifications. We consider various potential mechanisms, where our preferred explanation - improved salience of incentives - is consistent with all of the findings...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{uncertainties}} in ion beam therapy planning is the calculation of ion ranges in the patient’s tissue from CT images. The presence of non-tissue-equivalent mate- rials and materials with high photon attenuation like metals may aggravate this problem. Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) allows to compute the electron density and effective atomic number. It could already be shown that this <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> <b>information</b> enables a more precise calculation of ion ranges. This thesis investigates the feasibility of the DECT approach {{for a range of}} metals from aluminum (Z = 13) up to tungsten (Z = 74). DECT scans of the samples reconstructed with a 16 bit CT scale and raw data based beam hardening correction were analyzed. The electron density and effective atomic number of aluminum and titanium (Z = 22) could be determined within the range of a few percent. These quantities could not be determined for samples with Z ≥ 22, but the samples were distinguishable from each other by their different CT numbers up to molybdenum (Z = 42). The precision of the determined ion ranges could be improved for aluminum from - 11. 46...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Apart {{from the}} {{geometries}} {{to be dealt}} with, rapid prototyping (RP) of heterogeneous objects requires <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> <b>information</b> to be processed. This generally involves {{a large amount of}} information to be processed simultaneously. The robustness and efficiency problems, which seem less critical in homogeneous solid fabrications, become an issue. The direct impetus {{of this paper is to}} present robust and efficient algorithms for RP of heterogeneous objects. Design/methodology/approach - The robustness is benefited from using the proposed non-manifold heterogeneous cellular model, which guarantees gap-free material depositions around material interfaces. The efficiency enhancement is achieved by eliminating repetitive boundary intersections and using a heuristic material interrogation approach. Findings - By using the proposed algorithms, the robustness and efficiency of RP of heterogeneous objects can be improved. It is found that an average 30 percent efficiency improvement is obtained using the proposed heuristic material interrogation approach. Originality/value - Non-manifold heterogeneous cell representation (HC-Rep) is used in RP fields for the first time. Based on the HC-Rep, the robustness and efficiency of RP of heterogeneous object is addressed in this paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} studie (Greiwe and Ehlers, 2005), the author {{developed}} a decision based data fusion approach {{for the analysis}} of spatial and spectral high resolution image data of an urban scene. Image segments of high resolution orthophotos were classified with <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> <b>information</b> derived from hyperspectral image data. To retrieve this material information, the hyperspectral image data were classified by the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). Results of SAM were included into the classification of the high resolution orthophotos. The inclusion of hyperspectral image data significantly increased the classification accuracy of a high resolution orthophoto. One of the steps of the data fusion approach described above that more often requires the user input, is the SAM classification of hyperspectral data. One of the preconditions {{for the analysis of}} hyperspectral image data is the definition of a set of material reference spectra – often called image endmember. A manual selection of image pixel as a definition of image endmember leads to user dependent results. To avoid this, many approaches for unsupervised image endmember definitions, such asPPI or N-FINDR (Winter 1999) have been developed. These algorithms detect those pixels that define the convex hull of the n-dimensional feature space of hyperspectral image data. This produces endmembers that express ‘spectral extreme ’ features. Although the resulting endmembers are useful for spectral unmixing approaches, they are not suitable for material detection approaches like SAM. Algorithms like SAM, determine the spectral similarity between a pixel’s spectra and a given endmember. In contrast to endmembers that are defined by ’spectral extremes’, SAM needs endmembers that represent mean spectra of material types in orde...|$|E

40|$|In the GPR {{frequency}} range, {{electromagnetic wave}} attenuation is largely controlled by dielectric relaxation processes. A primary relaxation commonly {{occurs in the}} 10 – 100 MHz range for many earth materials in which the GPR signal propagates effectively. This relaxation leads to strong nonlinearity in the frequency dependent attenuation and occurs in a frequency range that is often used for groundwater investigations. This non-linearity complicates data analysis but also may provide <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> property <b>information.</b> I investigate inversion for Debye relaxation parameters directly from GPR reflection data, including increasing the bandwidth of the signal by summing the response from 25 MHz, 50 MHz, 100 MHz, and 200 MHz radar antennas. I compute the timefrequency distribution using spectral decomposition, then use the method of spectral ratios to measure the attenuation vs frequency curve for significant reflection events. I then fit the curve with the multiparameter Debye model. Using synthetic and field data I show that this approach provides reliable estimates of the primary relaxation time {{for a variety of}} realistic subsurface models. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of aquifer material properties...|$|R

The primary goal was to investigate the utility of HCMM data for geologic applications. Three techniques were used for displaying and combining thermal and visible near infrared (VNIR) data for two desert areas in southern California (Trona and Pisgah) : color additive composites (CAC) for day and night IR and day VNIR, principal components, and calculation of thermal inertia images. The HCMM thermal data were more effective than Landsat data in producing separation of compositionally different areas including volcanic and intrusive rocks. The satellite CAC data produced an image for a 1 x 2 degree area, and the color picture was enlarged to a scale of 1 : 250, 000. Playa composition, moisture content, presence of standing water, and vegetation cover were displayed in a variety of colors according to physical characteristics. Areas such as sand dunes were not distinguishable because of the coarse 500 -mm HCMM resolution. HCMM thermal data have shown a new dimension to geologic remote sensing, and future satellite missions should allow the continued development of the thermal infrared data for geology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background On-site rapid {{interpretation}} (RI) of fine needle aspiration (FNA) {{has been}} shown to increase the diagnostic yield of FNA and decrease the need for repeat diagnostic procedures. Because the pathologist interprets {{only a fraction of the}} sample and has limited resources available at such times, an occasional RI diagnosis will be changed at the time of the final diagnosis. We investigated how often these changes in diagnoses occur and the possible reasons for the changes. Methods All cytology reports from 1 / 1 / 02 to 12 / 31 / 03 from a single institution were reviewed. Cases with RI with discrepant final diagnoses were noted. The discrepant diagnoses were categorized depending on how they were changed. Possible sources for changed diagnoses were noted. Results Between 1 / 1 / 02 and 12 / 31 / 03 there were 1368 RIs of FNAs. Of these 80 (5. 8 %) had discrepancies between the RIs and final diagnoses. Seventy-eight cases had additional slides and/or cell block at time of final diagnosis. 16 cases had ancillary studies available at final diagnosis. Consultant pathologists were used in 7 cases. Different pathologists interpreted the RI and final diagnosis in 31 cases. Conclusion Although uncommon, discrepancies between RIs and final diagnoses occur 5. 8 % of the time at our institution. Most commonly, this involves a change of diagnosis from either "non-diagnostic" or "benign" to "malignancy". Although much of this is likely due to the presence of <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> and <b>information</b> at the time of final diagnosis, the number of cases that had different pathologists involved in the RI and final diagnosis suggests that inter-observer variability may also play some role.

The study therefore evaluated town-gown relationship in Ondo State Nigeria with direct cognisance to assessment of Community Information Services (CISs) by academic libraries. Complete enumeration sampling technique was adopted to distribute questionnaires to all 58 librarians working in academic libraries in the State. 52 questionnaires were returned and found useful. The response rate was therefore 89. 7 %. The study found that CISs were being rendered mainly to scholars who visited the library and not artisans, market women, drivers and so on. It was also found that visitors were not registered and not allowed to borrow. The main information being sought was on politics, job opportunities, entertainment and research, while materials used most were newspapers and textbooks.
