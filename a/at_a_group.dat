5|$|When {{termites}} {{construct their}} nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single termite {{would be in}} charge of any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{torpedo boat}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Benbow {{and the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further {{significant}} action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. Benbow fired briefly <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch shells and a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, Benbow had fired forty 13.5-inch armour-piercing, capped shells and sixty 6-inch rounds.|$|E

5|$|Glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) sets up his widower father Burt (Mike O'Malley) with Finn Hudson's (Cory Monteith) widowed mother Carole (Romy Rosemont). He {{believes}} that it will help him become closer to Finn, for whom he has feelings. Finn is upset when Carole sells their old furniture, and stops his late father's recliner from being sold. He is initially hostile to her dating someone new, but begins to bond with Burt over sports <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> dinner. Kurt feels left out, and later asks Finn to help him break up their parents. Finn initially agrees, but relents after Burt tells him that he loves Carole and would never hurt her. They watch a basketball game together and Finn allows Burt to sit in his father's recliner, while Kurt watches on sadly through the window.|$|E
5|$|Short Term 12 was {{originally}} conceived by Destin Daniel Cretton as a short film {{based on his}} experiences as a line staff worker <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> facility for teenagers where he had worked for two years; it served as his thesis project for his Master's degree in film at San Diego State University. The short film ran for 22minutes and premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize in Short Filmmaking. After graduating from film school, Cretton decided to adapt the short into a feature-length screenplay, which won one of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' five Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2010. The largest change Cretton made when adapting the short film into a longer screenplay was changing the lead character's gender: Denim, a man loosely based on Cretton himself, became Grace, a young woman and the facility's supervisor. Cretton researched similar facilities and interviewed former employees for the film, noting that the script featured stories directly told by children in these facilities from his interviews.|$|E

25|$|The Iron Age {{settlement}} of the northeast Aegean was once attributed to Aeolians, descendants of Orestes and hence of the House of Atreus in Mycenae, from across the Aegean from Thessaly, Boiotia and Akhaia, all in mainland Greece. Pindar, in his 11th Nemean Ode, hints <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of Peloponnesians, {{the children of the}} fighters at Troy, occupying Tenedos, with Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, landing straight on the island; specifically he refers to a Spartan Peisandros and his descendant Aristagoras, with Peisandaros having come over with Orestes. Strabo places the start of the migration sixty years after the Trojan war, initiated by Orestes's son, Penthilos, with the colonization continuing onto Penthilos's grandson.|$|E

25|$|After obtaining scores, {{researchers}} {{are able to}} use the information to determine if there is a difference in the average risk estimate of the individual compared to the average risk estimate of their peers. Generally in negative events, the mean risk of an individual appears lower than the risk estimate of others. This is then used to demonstrate the bias' effect. The optimistic bias can only be defined <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> level, because at an individual level the positive assessment could be true. Likewise, difficulties can arise in measurement procedures, as {{it is difficult to determine}} when someone is being optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic. Research suggests that the bias comes from an overestimate of group risks rather than underestimating one's own risk.|$|E
25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Tickets for the venues {{were sold}} {{directly}} by UEFA via its website, or {{distributed by the}} football associations of the 16 finalists. Applications {{had to be made}} during March 2011 for the 1.4million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches. Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament. Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship. Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.|$|E
