The results showed that: (1) {{as the percentage of}} light transmittance of the water samples decreased, the reflected radiance increased; and (2) as the suspended sediment concentration (mg/l) increased, the reflected radiance increased in the 1 - 80 mg/l range.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{applying}} of remote sensing (RS) and information management technology to help large farms produce at maximum efficiency is undergoing development. The novelty {{of the method}} does not lie {{in the concept of}} "precision agriculture," which involves variation of seeding, of application of chemicals, and of irrigation according to the spatially and temporally local variations in the growth stages and health of crops and in the chemical and physical conditions of soils. The novelty also does not lie in the use of RS data registered with other data in a geographic information system (GIS) to guide the use of precise agricultural techniques. Instead, the novelty lies in a systematic approach to overcoming obstacles that, heretofore, have impeded the timely distribution of reliable, relevant, and sufficient GIS data to support day-to-day, acre-to-acre decisions concerning the application of precise agricultural techniques to increase production and decrease cost. The development and promotion of the method are inspired in part by a vision of equipping farm machinery to accept GIS (including RS) data and using the data for automated or semiautomated implementation of precise agricultural techniques. Primary examples of relevant GIS data include information on plant stress, soil moisture, and effects of applied chemicals, all derived by automated computational analysis of measurements taken by one or more <b>airborne</b> <b>spectroradiometers.</b> Proper management and timeliness of the large amount of GIS information are of paramount concern in agriculture. Information on stresses and changes in crops is especially perishable and important to farmers. The need for timeliness and management of information is satisfied by use of computing hardware and software capable of (1) rapid georectification and other processing of RS data, (2) packaging the output data in the form of GIS plots, and (3) making the data available to farmers and other subscribers by Internet password access. It is a goal of this development program to make RS data available no later than the data after an aerial survey. In addition, data from prior surveys are kept in the data base.

For that reason, high resolution field and airborne hyperspectral data is used to recognize a fungal sugar beet disease in a study area of south Germany. For the airborne part of the study, multitemporal hyperspectral remote sensing data is provided by an <b>airborne</b> <b>Spectroradiometer</b> (AVIS), which is operated by the Ground Truth Center Oberbayern (gtco, Germany). Additionally, tractor based multitemporal hyperspectral reflection data provided by the GVIS specrometer is used to validate the AVIS data and to compare to two classification results.

To detect the sugar beet disease Rhizoctonia solani, the reflection results can be elaborated with hyperspectral vegetation indices. Therefore, the two multitemporal datasets are analysed by calculating the OSAVI, {{which is one of}} these vegetation indices.

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of snow areas and surface albedo {{are crucial to}} advancing {{our understanding of the}} global climate system. This is because of the highly reflective nature of snow combined with its large surface coverage (snow can cover up to 40 % of the Earth's land surface during the Northern Hemisphere winter). The reflectance of snow varies with both solar incidence angle and the viewing angle. Visible sensors with different spatial resolutions have been used to infer the snow parameters. Currently, only nadir-viewing directional reflectance data are available from satellite observations. Observations at multiple angles are needed to infer the hemispheric reflectance albedo of snow fields. We propose to study the directional reflectance of snow fields using POLDER data, which contains information from different viewing angles and polarization. POLDER was successfully launched an the ADEOS- 1 satellite in August, 1996, however, because POLDER data are not yet available, data from ASAS, a pointable, <b>airborne</b> <b>spectroradiometer,</b> were used in this study. Data collected over Glacier National Park of Montana show strong angular dependence. Preliminary results confirm the anisotropic nature of the snow reflectance.

During NASA's Global Tropospheric Experiment/Chemical Instrumentation Test and Evaluation (GTE/CITE 3), simultaneous shipboard and aircraft {{studies were carried out}} in the North Atlantic, followed by aircraft studies in the South Atlantic. Surface concentrations of chlorophyll alpha were measured with an <b>airborne</b> <b>spectroradiometer,</b> the Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS), with simultaneous determinations of tropospheric DMS.

No relation was observed between shipboard aquatic DMS and chlorophyll alpha or primary productivity. Higher levels of aqueous DMS were not always reflected by atmospheric DMS, although shipboard and aircraft measurements of atmospheric DMS agreed very well. A significant relationship between atmospheric DMS and ocean color was seen once at low altitudes in both the North and South Atlantic only under clean air conditions. Atmospheric DMS levels during the North Atlantic experiment were probably lowered by the presence of mostly polluted air masses in the study area and were, overall, probably not representative of the in situ sea-to-air flux of DMS. Changes in concentration of aircraft-sensed chlorophyllous pigments were not reflected by atmospheric DMS.

40|$|When {{retrieving}} {{ground surface}} temperatures from remote sensing images by a radiative transfer model, error's can {{arise from the}} use of atmospheric vertical profiles that are not well representative of the imaged area; due to non-local and/or non-simultaneous measurements. The magnitude of these errors is dependent on many factors such as the platform of the sensor (satellite or aircraft), the kind:of sensor (channel wavelength and band width) and the actual meteorological condition on the area. An evaluation of these errors is performed, both by means of a simulation and by studying a real case using the data extracted from images acquired over Mt Etna (Sicily, southern Italy) by the MIVIS (Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer) <b>airborne</b> <b>spectroradiometer</b> during the 'Sicilia- 94 ' remote sensing campaign. We mainly connect the error in;surface temperature and the error in the columnar water vapor content caused by a non-representative profile. We show that, in the case studied, these errors cannot be neglected; e. g., differences up to 5 degrees C in the most transparent channel (the other channels show greater values) are found. This work furnishes an important evaluation to the group working on the 'Sicilia- 94 ' campaign and,it may be useful for all the MIVIS users. Moreover, it makes possible comparison with other airborne TIR sensors like TIMS or ATLAS.

Nyatoh {{is one of the}} important and popular timber species for furniture, solid doors and planks. Approach: In order to determine Nyatoh's latest species count in the Federal Territory (FT) 's Permanent Reserved Forest, a study on the distribution of Nyatoh in Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve (FR), FT was conducted using an airborne hyperspectral remote sensing technique with an objective to identify, count and map the species of Nyatoh in Bukit Nanas FR, FT. A False Color Composite (FCC) airborne hyperspectral image of the study area was used with a Sobel 3 × 3 filter and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) to classify and separated the individual Nyatoh from other tree species within Bukit Nanas FR. Results: A thematic map of individual Nyatoh spatial distribution in Bukit Nanas FR was developed showing a total of 36 individual Nyatoh trees in a 2. 7 h study plot. There were 34 trees confirmed available on the ground with a mapping accuracy of 94. 4 %. Conclusion: The AISA <b>airborne</b> <b>spectroradiometer</b> data is capable of mapping and counting individual tropical timber trees especially Palaquium spp. with an acceptable accuracy of more than 90 %. However, in order to improve the mapping accuracy, it is recommended that a higher spatial resolution image data is necessary in addition to a higher precision field GPS usage.

Passive reflectance remote sensing and, both passive and active fluorescence sensing methods were investigated. Reflectance and fluorescence methods are reported to detect changes in the primary plant pigments (chlorophylls a and b; carotenoids) in higher plant species. As a general rule, foliar chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) usually exist in approx. 3 :l ratio. In plants under stress, Chl b content is affected before Chl a reductions occur. For reflectance, {{a version of the}} chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (CARI) method was tested with narrow bands from the <b>Airborne</b> Imaging <b>Spectroradiometer</b> for Applications (ASIA). CARI minimizes the effects of soil background on the signal from green canopies. A modified CARI (MCARI) was used to track total Chl a levels in the red dip of the spectrum from the corn canopy. A second MCARI was used to track the auxiliary plant pigments (Chl b and the carotenoids) in the yellow/orange/red edge part of the reflectance spectrum. The difference between these two MCARI indices detected variations in N levels across the field plot canopies using ASIA data. At the leaf level, ratios of fluorescence emissions in the blue, green, red and far-red wavelengths sensed responses that were associated with the plant pigments, and were indicative of energy transfer in the photosynthetic process. N stressed corn stands could be distinguish from those with optimally applied N with fluorescence emission spectra obtained from individual corn leaves. Both reflectance and fluorescence methods are sensitive in detecting corn N needs and may be especially powerful in monitoring crop conditions if both types of information can be combined...|$|R

40|$|Classical error {{analysis}} in remote sounding distinguishes between four classes: "smoothing errors," "model parameter errors," "forward model errors," and "retrieval noise errors". For infrared sounding "interference errors", which, in general, cannot be described by these four terms, can be significant. Interference errors originate from spectral residuals due to "interfering species" whose spectral features overlap with the signatures {{of the target}} species. A general method for quantification of interference errors is presented, which covers all possible algorithmic implementations, i. e., fine-grid retrievals of the interfering species or coarse-grid retrievals, and cases where the interfering species are not retrieved. In classical retrieval setups interference errors can exceed smoothing errors and can vary by orders of magnitude due to state dependency. An optimum strategy is suggested which practically eliminates interference errors by systematically minimizing the regularization strength applied to joint profile retrieval of the interfering species. This leads to an interfering-species selective deweighting of the retrieval. Details of microwindow selection are no longer critical for this optimum retrieval and widened microwindows even lead to reduced overall (smoothing and interference) errors. Since computational power will increase, more and more operational algorithms {{will be able to}} utilize this optimum strategy in the future. The findings of this paper can be applied to soundings of all infrared-active atmospheric species, which include more than two dozen different gases relevant to climate and ozone.

Albedo estimates using an explicit representation of snow surface temperature, snow age, and solar illumination angle, based on the Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS), were within the 0. 02 AVIRIS measurement error for 78 % of the snow-covered portions of the watershed. Conversely, albedo values estimated using a simple model based solely on snow surface age underestimated AVIRIS-observed albedo. Correlations between the timing of snowmelt and observed runoff using the BATS albedo model (R 2 = 0. 69) were significantly better than those using the age-based approach (R 2 = 0. 59) and were comparable to using AVIRIS data (R 2 = 0. 73). Snow extent was simulated most accurately with the AVIRIS parameterization; average map accuracy was 79 and 10 % greater than when using the age-based and BATS albedo parameterizations, respectively. The error in snow water equivalent for April was 14 % for BATS versus 39 % for the age-based albedo; however, {{it was less than}} 1 % for simulations using AVIRIS albedo data.

Blocks of trees treated with iron chelates created a dynamic range of chlorophyll concentration as measured in leaves. A relationship is obtained between the measured spectra and estimated biochemical parameters via inversion of a linked directional homogeneous canopy reflectance model (ACRM) and the PROSPECT leaf model. Numerical model inversion was conducted by minimizing {{the difference between the}} measured reflectance samples and modeled values. An improved optimization method is presented. Results are compared with a simple linear regression analysis, linking chlorophyll to the reflectance measured at the leaf level and Top of Canopy (TOC). Optimal band regions and bandwidths are analyzedWe {{would like to thank the}} Belgian Science Policy Office for financing this work. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{sensitivity analysis}} investigating {{the effect of}} woody elements introduced into the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model on the nadir bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) for a simulated Norway spruce canopy was performed {{at a very high}} spatial resolution (modelling resolution 0. 2 m, output pixel size 0. 4 m). We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i. e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents). The simulation of each scenario was performed for 10 different canopy closures (CC = 50 - 95 %, in steps of 5 %), 25 leaf area index (LAI = 3. 0 - 15. 0 m 2 m- 2, in steps of 0. 5 m 2 m- 2), and in four spectral bands (centred at 559, 671, 727, and 783 nm, with a FWHM of 10 nm). The influence of woody elements was evaluated separately for both, sunlit and shaded parts of the simulated forest canopy, respectively. The DART results were verified by quantifying the simulated nadir BRF of each scenario with measured <b>Airborne</b> Imaging <b>Spectroradiometer</b> (AISA) Eagle data (pixel size of 0. 4 m). These imaging spectrometer data were acquired over the same Norway spruce stand that was used to parameterise the DART model. The Norway spruce canopy modelled using the DART model consisted of foliage as well as foliage including robust woody constituents (i. e. trunks and branches). All results showed similar nadir BRF for the simulated wavelengths. The incorporation of small woody parts in DART caused the canopy reflectance to decrease about 4 % in the near-infrared (NIR), 2 % in the red edge (RE) and less than 1 % in the green band. The canopy BRF of the red band increased by about 2 %. Subsequently, the sensitivity on accounting for woody elements for two spectral vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the angular vegetation index (AVI), was evaluated. Finally, we conclude on the importance of including woody elements in radiative transfer based approaches and discuss the applicability of the vegetation indices as well as the physically based inversion approaches to retrieve the forest canopy LAI at very high spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{classification}} of {{remotely sensed images}} attempts to discriminate between surface cover types {{on the basis of}} the spectral response recorded by a sensor. It is well known that surfaces reflect incident radiation as a function of wavelength producing a spectral signature specific to the material under investigation. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors sample the spectral response over tens and even hundreds of wavelength bands to capture the variation of spectral response with wavelength. Classification algorithms then exploit these differences in spectral response to distinguish between materials of interest. Sensors of this type, however, collect detailed spectral information from one direction (usually nadir); consequently, do not consider the directional nature of reflectance potentially detectable at different sensor view angles. Improvements in sensor technology have resulted in remote sensing platforms capable of detecting reflected energy across wavelengths (spectral signatures) and from multiple view angles (angular signatures) in the fore and aft directions. Sensors of this type include: the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), the multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR), and the <b>airborne</b> solid-state array <b>spectroradiometer</b> (ASAS). A goal of this paper, then, is to explore the utility of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) models in the selection of optimal view angles for the {{classification of}} remotely sensed images by employing a strategy of searching for the maximum difference between surface BRDFs. After a brief discussion of directional reflect ante in Section 2, attention is directed to the Beard-Maxwell BRDF model and its use in predicting the bidirectional reflectance of a surface. The selection of optimal viewing angles is addressed in Section 3, followed by conclusions and future work in Section 4...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} {{profiles}} of atmospheric state parameters are being retrieved from remote soundings {{in the infrared}} spectral domain. Classical error analysis, which was originally applied to microwave sounding systems, distinguishes between "smoothing errors," "forward model errors," "forward model parameter errors," and "retrieval noise errors". We show that for infrared soundings "interference errors", which have not been treated up to now, can be significant. Interference errors originate from "interfering species" that introduce signatures into the spectral measurement which overlap with the spectral features used for retrieval of the target species. This is a frequent situation in infrared atmospheric spectra where the vibration-rotation bands of different species often overlap; {{it is not the}} case in the microwave region. This paper presents a full theoretical formulation of interference errors. It requires a generalized state vector including profile entries for all interfering species. This leads to a generalized averaging kernel matrix made up of classical averaging kernels plus here defined "interference kernels". The latter are used together with climatological covariances for the profiles of the interfering species in order to quantify the interference errors. To illustrate the methods we apply them to a real sounding and show that interference errors {{have a significant impact on}} standard CO profile retrievals from ground-based mid-infrared solar absorption spectra. We also demonstrate how to minimize overall error, which is a trade-off between minimizing interference errors and the smoothing error. The approach used in this paper can be applied to soundings of all infrared-active atmospheric species, which includes more than two dozen different gases relevant to climate and ozone. And this holds for all kind of infrared remote sounding systems, i. e., retrievals from ground-based, balloon-borne, <b>airborne,</b> or satellite <b>spectroradiometers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The U. S. upper Midwest was {{subjected}} to severe flooding {{during the summer of}} 1993. Heavy rainfall in the Mississippi River basin from April through July caused flooding on many Midwest rivers, including the Mississippi, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas Rivers. The flood crest of 15. 1 m at St. Louis, Missouri, on 1 August 1993 was the highest ever measured, surpassing the previous record of 13. 2 m set on 28 April 1973. Damage estimates include at least 47 flood-related deaths and a total damage cost of $ 12 billion. Remotely sensed imagery of severe flooding in the U. S. Midwest was obtained under cloud-free skies on 29 July 1993 by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging <b>Spectroradiometer)</b> <b>Airborne</b> Simulator (MAS). The MAS is a newly developed scanning spectrometer with 50 spectral bands in the wavelength range 0. 55 - 14. 3 micrometers. Estimation of the total flooded area in the MAS scene acquired near St. Louis was accomplished by comparing the MAS scene to a Landsat- 5 thematic mapper (TM) scene of the same area acquired on 14 April 1984 in nonflood conditions. For comparison, the MAS band centered at 0. 94 micrometers and the TM band centered at 1. 65 micrometers were selected because of the high contrast seen in these bands between land and water-covered surfaces. An estimate of the area covered by water in the MAS and TM scenes was obtained by developing land/water brightness thresholds from histograms of the MAS and TM digital image data. Afetr applying the thresholds, the difference between the area covered by water in the MAS and TM scenes, and hence the flooded area in the MAS scene, was found to be about 396 sq km, or about 153 square miles...|$|R
