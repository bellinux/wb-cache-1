5|$|At 6ft 4 in, 225lb (1.93m, 102kg), Ripken was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot {{players who}} played a defensively {{difficult}} position but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans {{to be part of}} Ripken's legacy.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{was hired}} by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {{to play the role}} of The American (Alden Pyle in the book) in the 1958 version of The Quiet American, {{replacing}} Montgomery Clift when the latter dropped out. Michael Redgrave replaced Laurence Olivier who dropped out when Clift withdrew. The cold-war drama filmed in Vietnam was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> genre in which Murphy had normally been cast.|$|E

5|$|The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were {{designated}} in 1998. When they opened, {{they were the}} first anywhere in a rural area of Colorado. In <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> usual practice, the diamonds were painted in the right lanes rather than the left, so that Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) buses could get to and from their stops more easily.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{hip-hop and}} R {{sound of her}} {{previous}} studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2006, Origins was {{announced}} as in development by Climax Studios, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments. The first previews {{of the game}} featured <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third-person view typical of the series to a Resident Evil 4-style camera angle, and an emphasis on action and combat {{to a greater degree}} than the previous installments in the series. In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included a laser sight for his pistol and an option for the player to barricade areas. At the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006.|$|E

5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, {{a process known as}} subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E
5|$|Black Cherry is {{the second}} studio album by English {{electronic}} music duo Goldfrapp, released on 23 April 2003 by Mute Records. It marked <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ambient sound of their debut album, Felt Mountain (2000), incorporating glam rock and synthpop music; inspirations were Spanish disco group Baccara and Swedish techno artist Håkan Lidbo. The album was met with positive reviews, with many critics complimenting its blend of retro and modern electropop music.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been {{compared to that of}} John F. Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} games, {{which included}} five factions in the campaign, Days of Ruin features only four: the Rubinelle 12th Battalion (Red), Lazurian Army (Blue), New Rubinelle Army (Yellow), and Intelligent Defense Systems (Black), although The Beast (also Black and also allied with IDS) {{could be considered}} a separate faction. These factions have different names in the American, European, and Japanese versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|Move is {{the tenth}} studio album by Christian rock band Third Day. Released on October 19, 2010, {{the album was}} the band's first after guitarist Brad Avery left Third Day. The band wanted the album to be <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> modern rock stylings of Revelation (2008), {{intending}} to show more of their southern rock roots. Third Day chose to work with producer Paul Moak on the album and recorded it at their own studio, feeling it offered them more creative freedom. Primarily a southern rock album, Move also has significant influence from gospel music.|$|E

5|$|Recorded at Island Records' {{studio in}} London, {{it was their}} first album with John Evan as a {{full-time}} member, their first with new bassist Jeffrey Hammond, and last album featuring Clive Bunker on drums. Something of <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> band's previous work, the album features more acoustic material than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennie—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson's own personal experiences.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements {{into their}} usual pop punk sound. These elements {{were inspired by}} lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E
5|$|Some temples, in <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> norm, were {{dedicated}} to deities other than Shiva or Vishnu. These include the Surya (portrayed as 'Suryanarayana') shrine at the Kasi Vishveshwara temple complex and a Jain temple {{dedicated to}} Mahavira, both at Lakkundi; the Taradevi temple (built in a Buddhist architectural style) at Dambal in the Gadag district; the Mahamaya temple {{dedicated to a}} tantric goddess at Kuknur in the Koppal district, and the Durga temple at Hirekerur in the Haveri district.|$|E

5|$|The Bayan class marked <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} Russian armored cruisers, as {{they were}} smaller ships designed to serve as scouts for the fleet rather than as commerce raiders. Authorized in the 1896–1902 building program, the design was outsourced to a French shipyard, Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée, because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. Negotiations began in March 1897, and a contract was signed in May 1898 for one ship with delivery in 36 months.|$|E
5|$|The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band L7, {{released}} on February 25, 1997 by Slash Records in collaboration with Reprise Records. It was recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood and Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The band recorded most of the album as a trio formed by founding members Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner, and longtime drummer Demetra Plakas, following the departure of bassist Jennifer Finch. The album marks <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tough rock style of its predecessors to a slower and more adventorous style.|$|E
5|$|The Sprawl trilogy was {{followed}} by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an alternative history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent steampunk literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.|$|E
