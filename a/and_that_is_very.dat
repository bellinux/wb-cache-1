500|$|Biden's most {{important}} role {{within the administration}} was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe {{is that when we}} get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|A large seabird, the albatross, {{played a}} central part in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's {{influential}} 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which in turn {{gave rise to the}} usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. In his 1902 poem The Sea and the Hills, Rudyard Kipling expresses the urge for the sea, and uses alliteration to suggest the sea's sound and rhythms: [...] "Who hath desired the Sea?—the sight of salt water unbounded— The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?" [...] John Masefield also felt the pull of the sea in his Sea Fever, writing [...] "I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky." [...] The Argentine Jorge Luis Borges wrote the 1964 poem El mar (The Sea), treating it as something that constantly regenerates the world and the people who contemplate it, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> close to the essence of being human.|$|E
500|$|Marlohe {{expanded}} on Sévérine's personality {{beyond what}} {{was written in}} the screenplay. She said she added a feeling of [...] "raziness" [...] to the character, partially basing it on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. She also thought more critically about Sévérine's relationship with Silva, saying: [...] "I just built everything with my imagination, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> exciting, too, because there's room for accidents on set." [...] GMA Network's Mikhail Lecaros wrote that Marlohe approached the character with a [...] "bemused cynicism". Daniel Craig praised Marlohe's approach to the character, saying she [...] "brought a huge amount of depth to what is essentially a very small part" [...] and [...] "gave her an awful lot of history in the way she played it". He added that he felt her preparation made the scenes easier to act, and would make the interactions between Bond and Sévérine more appealing to the audience. While discussing her working relationship with Craig, Marlohe described him as [...] "funny, very humble...".|$|E

2500|$|Though {{he never}} planned {{to play for}} Michigan, Daley looked back on the {{opportunity}} as a stroke of luck. [...] "I was a lucky guy. [...] I got to play for two great schools, but playing at Michigan {{was one of the}} greatest thrills I could have had. [...] When I was at Michigan, I was the happiest guy in the world." [...] Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: [...] "It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to me long after I played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> special." [...] Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. [...] In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12. [...] Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame. [...] Said Daley, [...] "I wanted to beat them so bad, and I played one of the best games of my life, but it wasn't to be." ...|$|E

50|$|Every {{year the}} Goat Milk Festival is {{dedicated}} to a theme. 2008 was marked by {{the replacement of the}} bell.

The Goatmilk Festival paved by help of many artists the way for its replacement. Supported by the Goethe-Institut in Sofia, Bela Rechka 2009 received a new bell. The bell of Bela Rechka was realized within the European program Culture 2000 by the New Culture Foundation in collaboration with the Borderland Foundation (Poland) and the Laundry Association (Birmingham, England). There were also donations and the participation of numerous volunteers.|$|R

She knew that stones do not carry the scent well, and that Bowser the Hound would have hard work to smell her on the stone wall. Way {{down at the end of}} the pasture an old apple tree {{stretched}} a long limb out towards the stone wall. When she got opposite to this she jumped onto this long limb and ran up into the tree.

60|$|In {{consequence}} of this atmosphere of Calvinism in the cultured world of to-day, it is apparently necessary to begin all arguments on education with some mention of obstetrics and the unknown world of the prenatal. All I shall have to say, however, on heredity will be very brief, because I shall confine myself to {{what is known about}} it, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> nearly nothing. It is by no means self-evident, but it is a current modern dogma, that nothing actually enters the body at birth except a life derived and compounded from the parents. There is at least quite as much to be said for the Christian theory that an element comes from God, or the Buddhist theory that such an element comes from previous existences. But this is not a religious work, and I must submit to those very narrow intellectual limits which the absence of theology always imposes. Leaving the soul on one side, let us suppose {{for the sake of argument}} that the human character in the first case comes wholly from parents; and then let us curtly state our knowledge rather than our ignorance.|$|E
