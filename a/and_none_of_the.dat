5|$|A {{stand-alone}} sequel, Jingle All the Way 2, {{was released}} straight-to-DVD in December 2014. Directed by Alex Zamm and produced by WWE Studios and 20th Century Fox, {{the film has}} a similar plot to the original, but is otherwise not connected <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original cast or characters returned. The lead roles were instead played by Larry the Cable Guy and Santino Marella.|$|E
5|$|According to Shia scholar Mohammad Jafar Tabasi, {{the graves}} of Shia Imams buried in al-Baqi had been revered and since {{hundreds}} of years ago <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sunni scholars ulamas regarded the shrines as innovation. Weeks before the second demolition, at the request of Ibn Bulayhid, a group of fifteen scholars from Medina unanimously issued a fatwa (an Islamic legal ruling) condemning the making of mausoleums around the graves.|$|E

5|$|Badr {{began at}} 14:00 on October 6, 1973. As the Israelis {{expected}} the attack to begin four hours later, {{only part of}} the troops <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armor assigned to man the Bar Lev Line were in position, except for a few platoons in the northernmost forts.

5|$|Despite this, the Army Air Corps {{found the}} {{performance}} of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21. However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> YB-21s were ever built, leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed. Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement.|$|E
5|$|Football {{for women}} ranks between the 5th and 10th most popular {{sport in the}} country, though its {{popularity}} is increasing.

5|$|On 20 July 1913, {{while making}} an {{intermediate}} stop in Hoboken, New Jersey, Breslau was being warped into position when an electrical {{fire broke out}} at the pier where she was docking. Breslau made an emergency departure into the Hudson River, during which time the blaze was extinguished. The ship was not damaged <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1,500 passengers aboard were injured in the incident. The ship left for Philadelphia on schedule the next day.|$|E
5|$|The black {{community}} of Africville, {{on the southern}} shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula, was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south. However, Africville's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. Africville received little of the donated relief funds <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progressive reconstruction invested {{in other parts of}} the city after the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-one {{different}} players {{represented the}} club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were nine different goalscorers. Two players, Bill Purves and– {{for the third consecutive}} season– Billy Ollis, appeared in every League match, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first-choice eleven missed more than four League matches. The top scorer, for the second year running, was inside-forward Frank Mobley with 13goals. The match against Sunderland attracted a crowd estimated at15,000, around double the highest attendance from previous years.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four sold especially well.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of World War II, {{warships}} of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage to several of the factories targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese {{did not attempt to}} attack the Allied bombardment forces, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> involved warships suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of friendly fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E

5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E
5|$|In the {{critical}} November 1946 election {{to select the}} first ever deputies to represent Madagascar at the French National Assembly, MDRM accused the French administration of stuffing ballot boxes, tampering with electoral rolls, intimidating MDRM candidates and supporters, and blatantly falsifying election results to ensure PADESM victory. Despite these irregularities, MDRM won 71 percent of the vote, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PADESM candidates was elected. While MDRM won decisive victories in the central and eastern province, results were close in the western province, where the MDRM candidate Joseph Raseta won 21,475 votes and the PADESM candidate Totelehibe won 19,014 votes.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising {{that he will be}} handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E
