50|$|The polar <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> {{is similar}} to a usual pie chart, except sectors have equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends {{from the center of the}} circle.The polar <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> is used to plot cyclic {{phenomena}} (e.g., counts of deaths by month).For example, if the counts of deaths in each month for a year are to be plotted then there will be 12 sectors (one per month) all with the same angle of 30 degrees each. The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.If the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> famously developed by Florence Nightingale.|$|E

5000|$|Indeed, Nightingale is {{described}} as [...] "a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart {{now known as the}} polar <b>area</b> <b>diagram,</b> or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a [...] "coxcomb", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. She later became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A {{system to}} measure the {{visibility}} of agricultural tractor operators was designed and evaluated according to ISO standards, and a blind <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> around the tested tractor was created based on the manual method recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Methods: A visibility measurement system was designed and evaluated based on the ISO 5006 and ISO 5721 - 1 standards. Two bulbs used to simulate the operator's eyes were mounted on a bar with a supporting frame. A wooden frame {{was used to determine}} the seat index point position. The 12 -m visibility test circle was divided into six sectors of vision, and the test tractor was placed {{at the center of the}} circle. Artificial light was supplied in the darkened environment, and shadow or masking effects were measured manually around the 12 -m circle. Results: When the bulbs were placed at the operator’s eye level, front visibility was good; no masking was found in the “A ” vision sector, but larger masking widths were found in the “B ” and “C ” vision sectors. Since the masking width exceeded 700 mm, additional tests, such as movement of the light sources to both sides of the operator’s eye level, were performed. Less than six masking effects were found in the semi-circle of vision to the front, and more than one masking was found in the “B ” and “C ” visual fields. The minimum distance between the centers of two masking effects exceeded 2500 mm when measured as a chord on the semi-circle of vision. A blind <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> was created to define the exact nature of the blind spots and mirror visibility. Conclusions: Visibility evaluation is an effective way to enable proper and safe operation for agricultural tractor operators.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} carried out in which iron was reacted in silica crucibles with an atmosphere of controlled oxygen and sulfur partial pressures. The equilibrium compositions of the melts were determined over the range 10 - 12 to 10 - 9 atm oxygen and 10 - 2. 75 to 10 - 1 atm sulfur and {{it was found that the}} Fe-O-S-SiO 2 system can exist as either a slag or oxysulfide. The oxysulfide contained appreciable quantities of dissolved oxygen and silica, although the levels decreased as the sulfur content was increased. Sulfur also had the effect of reducing the solubility of silica in the slag. When copper was added to the system, the solubility of oxygen and silica in the oxysulfide phase decreased dramatically. The results are examined in terms of the thermodynamics of the relevant reactions, and the predominance <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> for the copper-free system was established by combining the present results with those of earlier investigations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{establishment}} of olive (Olea europaea) orchards in Brazil is increasing {{due to their}} economic potential and benefits to human health. However, a number of limiting factors need to be overcome, such as Olive Leaf Spot (OLS) occurrence, for olives to reach their full potential. OLS, which is caused by Fusicladium oleaginum, results in defoliation {{and a reduction in}} fruit production. This study aimed to develop a standard <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> set (SAD) for the assessment of OLS severity under humid subtropical climate conditions. The SAD was developed with six levels of severity (1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 %) and OLS severity was validated by eight inexperienced raters. Using the SAD provided an increase in accuracy, precision and concordance, while also reducing the smallest difference detectable. The proposed SAD was adequate at estimating the OLS and could be a useful tool for use in epidemiological and phytopathometry studies, evaluation of control strategies and selection of resistant genotypes...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} use {{of field}} investigation and laboratory analyses allowed the detailed stratigraphic {{reconstruction of the}} Pollena eruption (472 AD) of Somma-Vesuvius. Three main eruptive phases were recognized, related either {{to changes in the}} eruptive processes and/or to relative changes of melt composition. The eruption shows a pulsating behavior with deposition of pyroclastic fall beds and generation of dilute and dense pyroclastic density currents (PDC). The eruptive mechanisms and transportation dynamics were reconstructed for the whole eruption. Column heights were between 12 and 20 km, corresponding to mass discharge rates (MDR) of 7 x 10 (6) kg/s and 3. 4 x 10 (7) kg/s. Eruptive dynamics were driven by magmatic fragmentation of a phono-tephritic to tephri-phonolitic magma during Phases I and II, whereas phreatomagmatic fragmentation dominated Phase III. Magma composition varies between phonolitic and tephritic-phonolitic, with melt viscosity likely not in excess of 10 (3) Pa s. The volume of the pyroclastic fall deposits, calculated by using of proximal isopachs, is 0. 44 km(3). This increases to 1. 38 km(3) if ash volumes are extrapolated on a log thickness vs. square root <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> using one distal isopach and column height...|$|E
40|$|Winter wheat is {{at or near}} to {{the flag}} leaf (Feekes 8) growth stage {{throughout}} the state. This is an important time to actively scout wheat fields to most effectively determine if {{the use of a}} foliar fungicide will be needed. The main diseases we have seen so far this spring include Septoria leaf blotch, powdery mildew, and tan spot. We have addressed those three diseases, plus other foliar diseases in the April 10 th Wisconsin Crop Manager. So far this year, the incidence and severity of these three diseases has been quite variable and dependent on the wheat variety and environment. With susceptible wheat varieties, we have seen incidence for Septoria leaf blotch and powdery mildew as high as 100 % in some of our plots. It is during this growth stage period that the main question regarding the use of a foliar fungicide should be considered. To help guide that process, there are four questions that should be considered (Beuerlein 2001 ; Miller 1999) : 1. Is there a fungal disease or diseases present? 2. Does the variety planted have resistance, and to which wheat diseases, or does it appear that disease pressure in the canopy is increasing? 3. Does the expected cropyield warrant the cost of applying a foliar fungicide? 4. Is the crop under stress If the answer to the first three questions is “yes”, and the answer to the last one is “no”, then application of a foliar fungicide will most likely be warranted. Besides identifying the foliar diseases in wheat, {{it is important to understand}} if the disease pressure is increasing. In Figures 1 and 2, two example sets of standard <b>area</b> <b>diagrams</b> are presented, the first for rust and the second for powdery mildew. Also, if the occurrence of disease is moving into the upper canopy, this is another indicator that the disease pressure is increasing. Figure 1.

40|$|A simple {{conceptual}} model of saturation excess runoff generation, the Hydrogeomorphic Steady State model (HGSS) is developed using widely observed geomorphic relationships: the saturation excess threshold, the area-slope relationship, and the cumulative <b>area</b> <b>diagram.</b> HGSS provides theoretical {{insight into the}} link between runoff generation by saturation excess and the geomorphology that governs it. Current models for saturation excess runoff generation require detailed analysis of catchment digital elevation maps (DEMs), and their prediction accuracy depends on the DEM grid resolution and the analysis techniques used on the DEM data. HGSS can predict the saturated area at steady state without site-specific DEM analysis. In its simplest form, HGSS requires only two parameters, each a combination of geomorphology parameters, together with soil and recharge properties. Effectively, HGSS predicts an antecedent recharge-dependent runoff coefficient. A scaling solution indicates {{that the percentage of}} the catchment saturated decreases with the square root of catchment area over a broad range of catchment areas and that the proportion of the catchment saturated has a log-log linear relationship with recharge. HGSS is tested by comparing its predictions with two DEM rainfall-runoff models, the steady state TOPMODEL and a kinematic wave saturation excess model DISTFW-EXT, with HGSS predictions matching for steady state conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of geographic positioning devices leads to the generation of large amounts of movement data, collected and stored in digital repositories. Such collections of movement data enable domain experts and scientists to analyze and discover interesting movement patterns. Analyzing the occurrence of stops (stops refer to full halts or very slow speed) in transportation systems is an im-portant challenge in movement data analysis. This analysis {{can be used to}} better understand traffic congestion problems and find cor-responding solutions. We propose an efficient system to analyze stop occurrences. It consists of two major parts that we describe in this paper. The first one deals with our algorithmic solutions. We propose an efficient clustering algorithm to partition the stops into groups. The main goal is to detect strongly connected com-ponents of stops, where two stops belong to the same component if they are close enough. The idea is that each component will be an isolated analysis element, providing an easy and useful means for investigation. The second part of our system deals with visual-ization. We visualize the clusters obtained with our algorithm with the polar <b>area</b> <b>diagram</b> famously introduced by Florence Nightin-gale, giving the users an easy and efficient way to detect important characteristics such as daily stop times and volumes.

T c is estimated from Time <b>Area</b> <b>Diagram</b> of the catchment and R is determined using optimization approach based on Downhill Simplex technique (code written in FORTRAN). Four different objective functions are used in optimization to determine R. The sum of least squares objective function is used in a novel way by relating it to slope of a linear regression best fit line drawn between observed and simulated peak discharge values to find R. Physical parameters (delineation, land slope, stream lengths and associated drainage areas) of the catchment are derived from SPOT satellite imageries of the basin using ERDAS: Arc GIS is used for geographic data processing. Ten randomly selected rainfall–runoff events are used for calibration and five for validation. Using CIUH, a Direct surface runoff hydrograph (DSRH) is developed. Kaha catchment (5, 598 km 2), part of Indus river system, located in semi-arid region of Pakistan and dominated by hill torrent flows is used to demonstrate the applicability of proposed approach. Model results during validation are very good with model efficiency of more than 95 % and {{root mean square error}} of less than 6 %. Impact of variation in model parameters T c and R on DSRH is investigated. It is identified that DSRH is more sensitive to R compared to T c.

AC 118 is a bimodal cluster, as evidenced both by our near–infrared images of lensed galaxies, by public X–ray Rosat images and by the spatial distribution of bright galaxies. Taking advantage of the extension and depth of our data, which sample an almost unexplored region in the depth vs. observed <b>area</b> <b>diagram,</b> we derive the luminosity function (LF), down to the dwarf regime (M ∗ + 5), computed in several cluster portions. The overall LF, computed on a 2. 66 Mpc 2 areas (H 0 = 50 km s − 1 Mpc − 1), has an intermediate slope (α = − 1. 2). However, the LF parameters depend on the surveyed cluster region: the central concentration has 2. 6 + 5. 1 − 1. 7 times more bright galaxies and 5. 3 + 7. 2 − 2. 3 times less dwarfs per typical galaxy than the outer region, which includes galaxies at an average projected distance of ∼ 580 kpc (errors are quoted at the 99. 9 % confidence level). The LF in the secondary AC 118 clump is intermediate between the central and outer one. In other words, the near–infrared AC 118 LF steepens going from high to low density regions. At an average clustercentric distance of ∼ 580 kpc, the AC 118 LF is statistically indistinguishable from the LF of field galaxies at similar redshift, thus suggesting that the hostile cluster environment plays a minor {{role in shaping the}} LF at large clustercentric distances, while it strongly affects the LF at higher galaxy density...|$|E
