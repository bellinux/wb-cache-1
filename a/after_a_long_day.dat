5|$|A {{vote was}} taken <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered {{from two to}} seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations {{voted in favor of}} independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of combat, the American fleet was {{in worse}} shape than the {{experienced}} British Navy. Upon ceasefire, Arnold called a council of war with his fellow officers, proposing to escape the British fleet via rowboats {{under the cover of}} night. As the British burned Arnold's flagship, the Royal Savage, to the east, the Americans rowed past the British lines.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> searching {{from house}} to house, the ATS checked a crib with a broken window on the {{north-eastern}} side of the township. The crib had large hedges on both sides, and a fibrolite shed at the rear. The group spotted Gray briefly at a window, and a battle ensued. Police put a stun grenade through a window, but it bounced off a mattress that Gray had placed as a barricade and landed back near police. Police fired teargas into the crib. Gray began shooting not at police but through the fibrolite shed.|$|E

500|$|Unreal Tournament {{received}} Eurogamer's {{first ever}} perfect score, who also named {{it one of}} the best games of 1999. Launch editor John Bye chose the shooter as the game of the past decade (1999–2009) and said, [...] "Unreal Tournament {{is one of the few}} games in the early days of Eurogamer that I kept going back to months after I'd finished reviewing it, a game that I played to unwind <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> playing other games. Whether it was trying to break the one-minute barrier in the speed running mayhem of Assault mode, battling back and forth amongst the alleyways of Domination, or dropping shrapnel shells at people's feet with the wonderfully chunky flak cannon in a fast and furious free-for-all deathmatch, Unreal Tournament was an endless source of entertainment." [...] In 2004, Unreal Tournament was inducted into the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|Moynihan's strong {{advocacy}} for New York's {{interests in the}} Senate, buttressed by the Fisc reports and recalling his strong {{advocacy for}} US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator Kit Bond, nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on civility in political discourse that Moynihan had once [...] "slugged [...] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an earmark Moynihan had slipped into a highway appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan’s office <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> to discuss their shared interest in urban renewal over a glass of port." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1879 Fahlberg, {{working with}} Remsen in a post-doctoral capacity, made an {{accidental}} discovery that changed Remsen's career. [...] Eating rolls at dinner <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> {{in the lab}} researching coal tar derivatives, Fahlberg noticed that the rolls tasted initially sweet but then bitter. Since his wife tasted nothing strange about the rolls, Fahlberg tasted his fingers and noticed that the bitter taste was probably {{from one of the}} chemicals in his lab. The next day at his lab he tasted the chemicals that he had been working with the previous day and discovered that it was the oxidation of o-toluenesulfonamide he had tasted the previous evening. He named the substance saccharin and he and his research partner Remsen published their finding in 1880. Later Remsen became angry after Fahlberg, in patenting saccharin, claimed that he alone had discovered saccharin. Remsen had no interest in the commercial success of saccharin, from which Fahlberg profited, but he was incensed at the perceived dishonesty of not crediting him {{as the head of the}} laboratory.|$|E

2500|$|The race {{finished}} in Chieti {{for the fourth}} successive year, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> in the saddle for the peloton. After a lumpy parcours out of the start town of Ortona, the riders had to wait some [...] {{for the first of}} three categorised climbs on the day. The first climb, the Forchetta di Palena, was not excessive steep at an average gradient of 3.3% but the climb itself was long and laborious at [...] long. After a substantial descent, the riders headed towards the second climb via the first of two intermediate sprint points at Lettomanoppello, before the steep Passo Lanciano. The Lanciano, [...] at 8.6%, was introduced by race organisers for the 2013 edition {{in order to make the}} run in to Chieti more demanding than before. Upon arriving in Chieti, there were two steep climbs in the final the first, averaging 7.7%, led up to the second intermediate sprint, and the second– after a short descent– averaged over 12% for , reaching 19% in places. Upon cresting the top of the climb, there was a false flat to the finish on the Via Salomone.|$|E

60|$|One evening, as she {{was coming}} home very tired <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> work in the slums of the city, Jane arrived at the model cottages outside my park gates.

60|$|John was a mild man, {{but he was}} human, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> work to {{come home}} tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or manner. He {{restrained}} himself however, and the little squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word.|$|R
60|$|I drifted {{across to}} the men's fires in search of Mulvaney, whom I found {{strategically}} greasing his feet by the blaze.

60|$|It happened, then, that {{shortly after}} the time when Professor von Baumgarten {{conceived}} {{the idea of the}} above-mentioned experiment, he was walking thoughtfully homewards <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> in the laboratory, when he met a crowd of roystering students who had just streamed out from a beer-house. At the head of them, half-intoxicated and very noisy, was young Fritz von Hartmann. The Professor would have passed them, but his pupil ran across and intercepted him.|$|E
60|$|He was {{so tired}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> in town that the girl, at {{considerable}} personal inconvenience, allowed him to finish his supper before recounting the manifold misdeeds of Mr. Tredgold. She waited until he had pushed his chair back and lit a pipe, and then without any preface plunged into the subject with an enthusiasm which she endeavoured in vain to make contagious. The captain listened in silence and turned a somewhat worried face in her direction when she had finished.|$|E
6000|$|An {{especially}} splendid sunset {{seemed to}} have been prepared to welcome them when, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> journey, they drove into a wide, green door-yard, where a white colt, a red cow, two cats, four kittens, many hens, and a dozen people, old and young, were gaily disporting themselves. Everyone nodded and smiled in the friendliest manner, and a lively old lady kissed the new-comers all round, as she said heartily, ...|$|R
60|$|Grant and his {{daughter}} had called when driving back from a distant farm, and Trooper Flett {{had returned to the}} homestead <b>after</b> <b>a</b> futile search for the liquor smugglers. He was not characterized by mental brilliancy, but his persevering patience atoned for that, and his superior officers considered him a sound and useful man. Sitting lazily in <b>an</b> easy chair <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> ride in the nipping frost, he discoursed upon the situation.|$|R
6000|$|I drifted {{across to}} the men's fires in search of Mulvaney, whom I found {{strategically}} greasing his feet by the blaze.

60|$|Captain Armand Jacot of the Foreign Legion sat upon an {{outspread}} saddle blanket at {{the foot}} of a stunted palm tree. His broad shoulders and his close-cropped head rested in luxurious ease against the rough bole of the palm. His long legs were stretched straight before him overlapping the meager blanket, his spurs buried in the sandy soil of the little desert oasis. The captain was taking his ease <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of weary riding across the shifting sands of the desert.|$|E
60|$|With legs crossed, {{his chin}} resting on one hand, his comely figure relaxed, he exhaled a {{fragrance}} of soap, {{as though in}} this perfect peace his soul were giving off its natural odour. His spirit, on the borderland of dreams, trembled with those faint stirrings of chivalry and aspiration, the outcome of physical well-being <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> in the open air, the outcome of security from all that is unpleasant and fraught with danger. He was awakened by voices.|$|E
6000|$|The {{attention}} of the reader is directed to the bravery of this officer. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of marching, and fighting, in the dark, without food and with small numbers, the man who will go on, unshaken and unflinching, after he has received a severe and painful wound, has in respect of personal courage few equals and no superior in the world. It is perhaps as high a form of valour to endure as to dare. The combination of both is sublime. [Both officers have received the Victoria Cross for their conduct on this occasion.] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} the band set out in a southwesterly direction, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> march halted near Cumnock. In the morning they started at the same time, observing more caution as they went, for by the {{afternoon}} they had crossed the stream and were {{within the boundaries of}} Carrick. They halted for the night near Crossraguel Abbey. Here for the first time Archie confided to his followers the object of their march.|$|R
60|$|At {{the village}} where they stopped, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> journey, {{the same line}} of conduct was {{observed}} towards them. The inhabitants guessed at once {{that they were in}} disguise; but the edicts against those who assisted fugitive insurgents were so severe that none made any open sign of their recognition. They paid for their night's lodging and food with a portion of their fish, which they were indeed glad to get rid of.|$|R
60|$|One evening, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> march, {{we came to}} a spot {{of great}} loveliness. At the foot of a bush-clad hill lay a dry river-bed, in which, however, were to be found pools of crystal water all trodden round with the hoof-prints of game. Facing this hill was a park-like plain, where grew clumps of flat-topped mimosa, varied with {{occasional}} glossy-leaved machabells, and all round stretched the sea of pathless, silent bush.|$|R
