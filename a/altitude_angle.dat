40|$|The {{possibility}} of using solar energy during winter {{depends on the}} available solar radiation and on the geometry of the receiving surface. For high latitudes, the annual distribution of the available radiation is characterized by high asymmetry with {{a large amount of}} solar radiation from high <b>altitude</b> <b>angles</b> during the summer and a small amount of direct radiation from small <b>altitude</b> <b>angles</b> during the winter. This article deals with the origin of the difference between available solar radiation during summer and winter at high latitudes. Factors like the tilt of the earth&# 8217;s axis, the eccentricity of the earth&# 8217;s orbit, absorption and scattering of radiation in the atmosphere and seasonal changes in the weather conditions are discussed. Numerical examples of how these factors contribute to the reduction of the winter radiation compared to the summer radiation on surfaces with different orientation in Stockholm, latitude 59. 4 &# 176;N, are given.

This technology preserves the optical image quality by keeping the mirrors perfectly positioned at all times. M1 is continuously reshaped by an actuator network of 84 axial motors distributed under the mirror surface and 24 radial dislocated laterally. Also in the primary mirror cell is another instrument able to modify the telescope's optical configuration by moving from a corrector composed by a double set of lenses, to an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) composed of a counter-rotating set of prisms, able to correct the optical dispersion phenomena due to the variation of air mass induced by changing the <b>altitude</b> <b>angle.</b> The secondary mirror is actively controlled by a deformable platform able to tilt the mirror during exposure. The active optics system also includes a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, mounted under the primary mirror cell together with the local guide system, able to furnish the optical correction feedback. These systems give the VST the capability to be autonomous in terms of guiding, tracking and active optics control.|$|E

The existences of the height information and its precision have direct influence over topographic map, especially the quality of large-scale and medium-scale topographic map, {{and the level of}} surveying and mapping support. There are a lot of methods about height information extraction, in which the main methods are ground survey (field direct measurement) spatial sensor and photogrammetric ways. However, automatic extraction is very tough.

Binarization image can be obtained using gray threshold estimated under the multiple constraints. On the interesting area, spot elimination and region splitting are made.
