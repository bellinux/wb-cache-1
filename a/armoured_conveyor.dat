In this paper, true stress-true strain curves of materials of the sprocket and the ring chain are obtained by computing the data of static tensile test. A simplified symmetric finite element contact model is established based on the nonlinear finite element software ABAQUS. Stress field and torsional stiffness coefficient of the sprocket are calculated according to loads and boundary conditions. Simulation results are in good accordance with the test results. The finite element model and the simulation results provide useful guidance for design and test of the sprocket. Meanwhile, accurate torsional stiffness coefficient of the sprocket is obtained for simulation of the transmission system of AFC...|$|R

Prior to the chainless haulage systems, haulage systems with Chain were popular, where a heavy duty chain was run {{along the length of}} the coal face for the shearer to pull itself along. The shearer moves at a speed of 10-30 m/min depending on cutting conditions.|$|R

The object of the simulation is the investigation of the vertical steering characteristics of face installations, the potential long-term instability of which is a continuing problem underground. The way in which the AFC structure moulds itself to the undulating floor cut by the coal winning machine (the power-loader) between successive cuts is a crucial factor in the steering behaviour of the entire face system. This, the first of two companion papers, treats the AFC as a chain of loosely coupled piecewise rigid segments (trays) rcsting on a solid coal floor. Such a model is found not to greatly assist the stability of the multipass longwall process. An elastic model is examined in the companion paper.

5000|$|Longwall mining - A set of {{longwall}} mining equipment {{consists of a}} coal shearer mounted on conveyor operating underneath a series of self-advancing hydraulic roof supports. Almost the entire process can be automated. Longwall mining machines are typically 150-250 metres in width and 1.5 to 3 metres high. Longwall miners extract [...] "panels" [...] - rectangular blocks of coal {{as wide as the}} face the equipment is installed in, and as long as several kilometres. Powerful mechanical coal cutters (shearers) cut coal from the face, which falls onto an <b>armoured</b> face <b>conveyor</b> for removal. Longwalls can advance into an area of coal, or more commonly, retreat back between development tunnels (called [...] "gateroads") As a longwall miner retreats back along a panel, the roof behind the supports is allowed to collapse in a planned and controlled manner.|$|R
40|$|A {{key factor}} {{enabling}} {{the achievement of}} the required capacity by longwall mining systems is to obtain a satisfactory service life for individual components of such systems. Such components include right-angle planetary gearboxes for <b>armoured</b> face <b>conveyors.</b> An increase in the service life of such equipment can be achieved by ensuring adequacy in terms of design, materials and organization. As a part of organizational changes, the use of individual diagnostics systems may have the greatest impact on the service life of mining gearboxes; however, their widespread implementation is limited by economic and operational barriers. This paper presents an analysis of the possibility of integrating mining gearboxes with electronic systems of technical diagnostics, as well as expanding the scope of the technical condition monitoring by the machines operating together with these gearboxes. As a result of the calculation and design work performed, it has been demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} integrate technical diagnostics systems with advanced data transmission capabilities inside gearboxes...|$|R
40|$|A load to an <b>armoured</b> face <b>conveyor</b> (AFC) during {{coal mining}} is {{changeable}} and very difficult or even {{impossible to be}} predicted. Changes of the load to the upper scraper chain affect the load of the driving motor and generate changes in a scraper chain tension. Impact of increasing the external load to the upper scraper chain on the operation of electric motors and on the scraper chain tension is presented. The developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor enabled identifying the places of the scraper chain high tension or places of its loosening. An impact of changing frequency of driving motor voltage on AFC’s operational conditions was tested and analysed using the AFC’s numerical model. During tests, tension of the scraper chain on the discharge end and the return end was recorded. High tension of the scraper chain and its loosening during the changeable load were also recorded on upward and downward transportation of run-of-mine material...|$|R

40|$|Longwall mining is the {{dominant}} form of underground coal mining methods in Australia. As production increases {{there is also a}} need for increased face ventilation rate for gas dilution and dust mitigation. The behaviour of gas emission and respirable dust in a longwall face is a complex process {{because of the nature of}} longwall operations. The generation, dispersion and transport of airborne dust and gas are governed mainly by the spatial velocity and the movement pattern of the ventilation air. To understand the gas and dust behaviour in a complex longwall mining environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of various dust control techniques, numerical modelling has become a necessity to supplement laboratory experiments and field studies. Three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed based on a longwall face extracting a medium seam (3. 2 m) to investigate the aerodynamics of methane gas emitting from drum cutting actions, and respirable dust from different sources. The model was developed to incorporate key features on the longwall, including the shearer, <b>armoured</b> face <b>conveyor</b> (AFC), chocks, outbye facilities and dust control devices. The base CFD model was calibrated using field ventilation survey data and used to study the behaviour of longwall gas and dust dispersion patterns that are vital to the safety and productivity of the longwall face...|$|R
40|$|<b>Armoured</b> face <b>conveyors</b> (AFCs) {{of length}} even up to 500 meters {{are used in}} coal mines for {{transportation}} of run-of-mine. The method of their installation depends on the geological and mining conditions and on a coal seam position. Operation of AFC in a horizontal or inclined position is allowed. The maximum accepted inclination {{is determined by the}} machine manufacturer. Two directions of longitudinal inclination of the conveyor have to be considered: upward and downward transportation of excavated material. Both the angle and the direction of inclination of the conveyor {{have a significant impact on}} the dynamics of its operation. Change in inclination of AFC results in tension of the chain. Loosening the scraper chain can lead to blockage, what can be a reason of damage. Excessive chain tension results in speeding up frictional wear of conveyor components. Determination of an impact of longitudinal inclination of the conveyor on a degree and a place of loosening or excessive tension of the chain was the objective of the numerical analyses, the results of which are presented. Analysis were performed using the developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor. These analyses are a part of the preparatory work aiming at development of the control algorithm of AFC, to prevent the formation of unfavorable dynamic effects during the conveyor operation...|$|R
40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel link chains reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel link chains, which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the chain link. This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the chain strand, customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a stud chain link with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the chain strand. The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but unloaded <b>armoured</b> face <b>conveyor</b> test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for chain hoists designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round link chains of different size more precisely...|$|R
40|$|The {{interacting}} multiple model (IMM) estimator {{is well-known}} as a cost-effective hybrid-state estimation scheme that has found application in (among other things) {{the detection of}} manoeuvering targets, robot navigation, probabilistic data association, and medical applications. Prima facie the IMM seems also to be a natural framework for fault detection and isolation (FDI) on plant where the dynamic behaviour undergoes describable structural change on the occurrence of faults. But for {{a small number of}} papers that have stated this potential, this application has not been exploited and, to date, no substantive experimental exploration of the efficacy of the the approach for FDI has been published. This thesis looks to bridge this gap. The overarching narrative of the thesis is the detection and isolation of faults on longwall mining systems and, in particular, a key piece of longwall infrastructure known as the <b>armoured</b> face <b>conveyor</b> (AFC). The purpose of the AFC is to transport sheared coal away from the coal-face. While longwall mining has many advantages, the process is limited by two characteristics: (i) the process is serial so that if one part of the system fails the whole system must usually stop; and (ii) breakdowns are frequent and the time-to-repair is usually long. AFC faults are a major contributor to the total downtime making their timely identification and isolation a powerful lever in increasing longwall productivity. Several of the faults that occur on longwall AFCs, in particular faults associated with the electrical machines that drive the conveyor, have the characteristic that when they occur, they discretely change the dynamic behaviour of the system. In this sense they look to be well suited to detection by an IMM approach. The IMM-FDI strategy explored here uses a family of plant-models, with each model describing a particular mode of operation. The members of the family are a normal operation mode and a number of fault modes. The reference plant model is based around a dynamic model that comprises two connected AC induction machines that serve as an abstraction of a real AFC. The dominant dynamics are the coupled electro-mechanical dynamics of the motors. The system faults correspond to changes in the model resulting from (i) a stator inductance fault, (ii) stator resistance fault, (iii) current probe sensor malfunction, (iv) a stator open circuit fault, and (v) an encoder malfunction. The FDI scheme works by performing continuous state propagation over each model, combined with discrete switching between alternate models using a standard IMM framework. As part of its workings, the IMM algorithm produces an estimate of the probability of each mode being the actual mode. The mode with the highest probability (on a moving average basis) is considered to be the working mode of the system, leading to the identification of the fault. The approach is explored in simulation and on a lab-scale AFC system that is able to replicate the electrical machine faults described above. In simulation the IMM-FDI technique demonstrated good discrimination capability between the faults of the fault set and was shown to be robust to incorrectly modelled fault magnitudes. When applied to the lab-scale AFC rig, the IMM-FDI scheme successfully isolated the stator inductance, current sensor, and stator open circuit faults, in addition to the normal operating regime. The incipient measurement fault could not be detected, while the stator resistance fault produced a number of false alarms. The main contribution of the thesis is the demonstration that IMM can be used for practical FDI. Like all model based FDI frameworks, the robustness of the scheme is critically dependant {{on the quality of the}} plant models in the family of failure modes. A useful next-step in this work would be to apply these ideas to an operational longwall and establish the performance of the system...|$|R
