6000|$|In {{the process}} of construction, the central wire of the copper core was first covered with <b>a</b> {{semi-liquid}} <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> gutta-percha, mixed with tar--known as [...] "Chatterton's Compound." [...] This was laid on so thick that when the other wires were wound round it all air was excluded. Then <b>a</b> <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> the same compound was laid over the finished conductor, and thus the core was solidified. Next, the core was surrounded with <b>a</b> <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> the purest gutta-percha--a splendid non-conductor, impervious to water--which, when pressed to it, while in a plastic state, formed the first insulator or tube to the core. Over this tube was laid <b>a</b> thin <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> Chatterton's Compound {{for the purpose of}} closing up any small flaws or minute holes that might have escaped detection. Then came <b>a</b> second <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> gutta-percha, followed by another <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> compound, and so on alternately until four <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> compound and four of gutta-percha had been laid on.|$|R

In 1997 the Board of Governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster’s heraldry while {{improving the quality of}} print and electronic reproduction.

5|$|Although the Congress of Tucumán {{had already}} formalized {{the flag of}} Argentina, the Army of the Andes did not use it, {{choosing}} a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms roughly similar to the Coat of arms of Argentina. The army {{did not use the}} flag of Argentina because it was not exclusively an Argentine army.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms. <b>A</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E

5|$|In August 1536, the {{new city}} was besieged by the troops of Manco Inca, {{the leader of}} an Inca {{rebellion}} against Spanish rule.

On November 3, 1536, the Spanish Crown confirmed the founding and, on December 7, 1537, emperor Charles V granted <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms to the city.|$|E

5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for {{displaying}} <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes {{such as the}} oval cartouche, but the shield {{has always been a}} clerical option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the cartouche.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national symbols that were used before the Soviet era. These included a flag of red and white stripes and <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national symbols were replaced by Soviet-era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two symbols, along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus.|$|E
