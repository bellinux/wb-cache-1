Bands of horses range together, {{consisting}} of as few as two animals, although there are generally more.

The Namib Desert Horse travels extensively, searching for food, water and shelter from the climate and insects. A 1994 study found that they have an average home range of , although not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> traversed each day.
