5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. <b>As</b> <b>stated</b> <b>in</b> , <b>the</b> gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration.

Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E
