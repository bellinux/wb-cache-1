They consist of quasi-steady aeroacoustic predictions based on noise-sources (given {{in terms of}} hemispheric acoustic maps rigidly connected to the rotorcraft) suitably extracted from a database generated through off-line aeroacoustic analysis of rectilinear, steady-state flights. This is of interest for the Clean Sky GRC 5 MANOEUVRES project, which aims at developing an in-flight noise monitoring system to make the pilot aware of acoustic disturbance produced.

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} pilot {{handling}} {{problems of a}} V/STOL aircraft during the <b>approach</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> to a restricted landing area in weather conditions of low cloudbase and poor visibility. The main aspects examined are: how the handling problems during the approach can be reduced {{by the use of}} automatic flight control or electronic display systems, in what way each form of augmentation can be most effectively used, and how they interact with each other. The early part of the thesis analyses the reasons for the increased pilot compensation task during the approach, and why current operational control and display systems do not permit a full instrument approach. The constraints imposed on the type of approach profile due to aircraft characteristics and external factors are next assessed, and preliminary conclusions drawn on the type of profile most suited to the handling qualities of V/STOL aircraft. Leading on from the approach profile, the range of controls and displays currently available are described and their applicability to the present problems is discussed. The main part of the document details the flight and simulator trials carried out, describes the display formats and control laws developed during the work, and justifies their use for the control and display interaction assessment. The final chapters analyse the qualitative and quantitative results obtained with the various levels of control and display systems investigated. The results illustrate {{the way in which the}} multi-variable control problems of the instrument approach can be broken down into separate tasks of inner loop and outer loop control, and demonstrate that the pilot is best employed controlling the outer loop flight path using the instrument display whilst the inner loop is controlled automatically by the flight control system...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{development}} {{in computer technology}} today has revolutionized the method used to predict ship hydrodynamic complex systems by application of numerical simulation approach. One important predictiontechnique made feasible by high-speed computers is the time-domain simulation especially in the prediction of ship motions, sea-keeping and also manoeuvring.

There are many test methods available for manoeuvring prediction such as free running and captive model tests. However these methods are expensive and time consuming.

60|$|She said this, but {{in their}} own rooms it was so {{soothing}} to sit looking through the long twilight at the lovely landscape that the sort of bruise given by their encounter with the Stollers had left her consciousness before March returned. She made him admire first the convent church on a hill further up the river which exactly balanced the fortress in front of them, and then she seized upon the little books he had brought, and set him to exploring the labyrinths of their German, with a mounting exultation in his discoveries.

For the study of this, Mrs. March realized, more and more passionately, that they were in the very most central and convenient point, for the history of Wurzburg might be said to have begun with her prince-bishops, whose rule had begun in the twelfth century, and who had built, on a forgotten Roman work, the fortress of the Marienburg on that vineyarded hill over against the Swan Inn. There had of course been history before that, but 'nothing so clear, nothing so peculiarly swell, nothing that so united the glory of this world and the next as that of the prince-bishops. They had made the Marienburg their home, and kept it against foreign and domestic foes for five hundred years. Shut within its well-armed walls they had awed the often-turbulent city across the Main; they had held it against the embattled farmers in the Peasants' War, and had splendidly lost it to Gustavus Adolphus, and then got it back again and held it till Napoleon took it from them.

40|$|Coastal development, such as land {{reclamation}} or dredging, usually changes {{the characteristics of}} the coastal waterway. A common phenomena due to restricted waterway is increase in ship resistance and reduction in manoeuvrability. The restricted water inflow under the vessel, result in increased water velocity under the hull. The increase of the inflow velocity at the rudder may result in the increase of the rudder normal force or create partial vacuum in the region near propeller and rudder. Consequently, manoeuvring of ships may become erratic in this condition. Standard for ship maneuvrabiity have been developed by International Maritime Organization (IMO) to ensure safe navigation/ship handling operation of ships. The standards provide criteria on the ship turning ability, yaw checking ability, course keeping ability and stopping ability. Where there is uncertainty in the behavior of the vessel especially in restricted waters, the use of numerical simulation for evaluating navigational risks is highly depended upon. In this paper, firstly, the effects on water depths and currents due to coastal development will be described. Secondly, using time domain simulation <b>approach,</b> the <b>manoeuvring</b> characteristics of vessel in two scenarios, i. e. deep and shallow water are discussed.

[...] The design of propellers for turbine engines has involved consideration of propeller operating conditions which were not of great significance {{in the case of}} piston-engined applications, and for which there existed very little basic test data. It has been found necessary to give particular consideration to the behaviour of the aircraft, engine and propeller when the latter is operating in the blade-angle ranges which occur during landing <b>approach,</b> ground <b>manoeuvring</b> and negative-thrust braked landings.

The manoeuvre is performed by tracking the maximum angular momentum component, corresponding to the commanded angular velocity parallel to the eigenaxis that takes the spacecraft directly onto the desired final attitude. Corrections to the resulting desired angular velocity are implemented if the attitude gets close to one of the forbidden attitudes (“obstacles”), represented by peaks of the Lyapunov function in the attitude space.

40|$|In {{emergency}} cases {{a vehicle}} has to avoid colliding {{with one or}} more obstacles, stay within road boundaries, satisfy acceleration and jerk limits, fulfil stability requirements and respect vehicle system dynamics limitations. The real time solution of such a problem is difficult and as a result various approaches, which usually relax the problem, have been proposed until now. In this study, a new method for computing emergency paths for complex driving scenarios is presented. The method which is based on the finite element concept formulates the dynamic optimisation problem as a linear algebraic one. An empirical formula adapts the size of the finite elements to optimise the dynamics of the emergency path. The proposed approach is evaluated in Matlab and Carsim simulation environments for different driving scenarios.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the ego-localization problem for an outdoor vehicle {{equipped}} with proprioceptive sensors. In a current way, the ego-localisation consists in two stages (prediction and updating of the vehicle state) {{in order to provide}} a new vehicle state with its associated uncertainty. Previous works have proved the efficiency of several type of algorithms. Among them, we can quote the IMM (Interacting Multiple Model) approach. IMM is based on the discretization of the vehicle motion space modeled by simple manoeuvres, such as Constant Velocity (CT) or Constant Turn (CT) models. This yields a very adapted <b>approach</b> for heavily <b>manoeuvring</b> vehicles. Unfortunately, without GPS data, this approach becomes difficult to use. The idea is to combine different kind of proprioceptive information by using the IMM (Interacting Multiple Model) approach in a credibilistic way for the likelihood model updating in the prediction stage. In our case, data are coming from dead reckoning sensors. This kind of sensors complement the GPS for updating the vehicle state as well as the model likelihood...|$|R
40|$|Multitarget {{tracking}} is {{the process}} of jointly determining the number of targets present and their states from noisy sets of measurements. The difficulty of the multitarget tracking problem is that the number of targets present can change as targets appear and disappear while the sets of measurements may contain false alarms and measurements of true targets may be missed. The theory of random finite sets was proposed as a systematic, Bayesian approach to solving the multitarget tracking problem. The conceptual solution is given by Bayes filtering for the probability distribution of the set of target states, conditioned on the sets of measurements received, known as the multitarget Bayes filter. A first-moment approximation to this filter, the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, provides a more computationally practical, but theoretically sound, solution. The central thesis of this work is that the random finite set framework is theoretically sound, compatible with the Bayesian methodology and amenable to immediate implementation {{in a wide range of}} contexts. In advancing this thesis, new links between the PHD filter and existing Bayesian <b>approaches</b> for <b>manoeuvre</b> handling and incorporation of target amplitude information are presented. A new multitarget metric which permits incorporation of target confidence information is derived and new algorithms are developed which facilitate sequential Monte Carlo implementations of the PHD filter. Several applications of the PHD filter are presented, with a focus on applications for tracking in sonar data. Good results are presented for implementations on real active and passive sonar data. The PHD filter is also deployed in order to extract bacterial trajectories from microscopic visual data in order to aid ongoing work in understanding bacterial chemotaxis. A performance comparison between the PHD filter and conventional multitarget tracking methods using simulated data is also presented, showing favourable results for the PHD filter. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of how {{community}} participation is understood, enacted, produced and governed {{in the context of}} an organization that promotes community participation. The contribution of this thesis is to shed light on the frequently found gap between the expectations and the reality of community participation. In examining how community participation is promoted, the thesis focuses in particular on actors such as community leaders and development workers, and the interactions between them. The thesis applies a multi-disciplinary theoretical framework, which is built through combining theoretical approaches that include discourse analysis, institutional analysis, and the actor-oriented approach. The framework accommodates the examination of the roles of various types of social factors in shaping the workings of community participation. These include the idea of community, social relations in communities, and the agency of actors who are promoting the approach. This thesis conducts a case study of the Council of Community Organisations (CCO) programme in Thailand, which is a large-scale promotion of community participation in development and governance. The case study examines the operation of the programme from national to local level, and explores several localities where the programme is being implemented. The exploration of the CCO programme illuminates pathways through which the approach’s inner mechanisms can constrain it from fulfilling the expectations. The thesis identifies how the idea of community, through its association with the sense of collective identity, tends to distort community participation from achieving empowerment. Moreover, the social relations in communities, generally characterised by inequality and diversity of interests, frequently constrain the approach from achieving effective mobilisation of collective action. Such a constraint is often accentuated by adverse incentives that community leaders face when they become part of development interventions. Finally, it is found that the deficiencies of community participation are likely to persist. This is because the actors who are promoting the <b>approach</b> usually <b>manoeuvre</b> to gain advantages from their roles in ways that reinforce the influence of the aforementioned factors.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPancreaticoduodenal trauma (PDT) is {{associated}} with substantial mortality and morbidity. In this study, contemporary trends were analysed using national data. MethodsThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998 – 2009 was queried for patients with PDT. Interventions including any operation (Any-Op) and pancreas-specific surgery (PSURG) were identified. Trends in treatment and outcomes were determined [complications, length of stay (LoS), mortality] for the Any-Op, PSURG and non-operative (Non-Op) groups. Analyses included chi-squared tests, Cochran–Armitage trend tests and logistic regression. ResultsA total of 27 216 patients (nationally weighted) with PDT were identified. Over time, the frequency of PDT increased by 8. 3 %, whereas the proportion of patients submitted to PSURG declined (from 21. 7 % to 19. 8 %; P = 0. 0004) {{and the percentage of}} patients submitted to non-operative management increased (from 56. 7 % to 59. 1 %; P = 0. 01). In the Non-Op group, mortality decreased from 9. 7 % to 8. 6 % (P 50 years. Having any operation (Any-Op) was associated with mortality, but PSURG was not a predictor of death. ConclusionsThe utilization of operations for PDT has declined without affecting mortality, but operative morbidity increased significantly over the 12 years to 2009.

40|$|A popular recent {{research}} trend is {{to investigate the}} feasibility {{of a team of}} cooperating UUVs (unmanned underwater vehicles). Animals group behaviour, such as fish schooling, may have lessons to offer the development of team cooperation. The goal {{of this paper is to}} justify the behaviour-based rules with fuzzy logic controlled priority weights works for team UUVs cooperation when considering dynamic manoeuvring models of an real UUV. The paper defines several behaviour-based rules to meet the requirement of a simple operational scenario. The steering angle factors generated from the rules are multiplied by the relative priority weight values and added together to make a decision on the desired vehicles' next steering angle. The priority weight values of rules are updated by the fuzzy logic method according to the situation that the vehicles meet in real time. In order to investigate the performance of the <b>approach</b> a dynamic <b>manoeuvring</b> model of a small UUV, SUBZERO III, is used to describe each vehicle in the team and a UUV cooperative mission scenario is assumed. The simulation results indicate that the entire system is successful in achieving the mission. Some parameters, such as vehicle velocity, motion update frequency, minimum distance between vehicles and minimum distance between vehicles and an obstacle, are discussed to prove that they must been specified in order to satisfy the mission requirements. From the results, we can conclude that the approach has potential for a real team of cooperative UUVs...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} near miss events is an {{important}} element of safety management, since they often demonstrate the symptoms of system design flaws. It has previously been estimated that the risk of death when cycling is 12 times higher than when driving a car (Pucher & Dijkstra, 2003; cited in Boufous et al., 2012). To date, however, there has been little research examining cyclist near misses and the role that the road system plays in them. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the sequence of behaviours and factors involved in cyclists’ near collisions with other road users. Twenty cyclists rode a pre-defined urban route whilst providing concurrent think aloud verbal protocols and being filmed by a researcher travelling behind. Three researchers identified near miss collisions from the video footage. The video footage and verbal protocols were then analysed to identify: 1) the type of conflict; and 2) the sequence of behaviours and contributory factors involved using a sequential model of crashes/near crashes (Guo et al., 2010). The analysis showed that the majority of events occurred as cyclists <b>approached</b> intersections (pre-incident <b>manoeuvre),</b> as cyclists disrupted the flow of traffic (precipitating factor), and car drivers had to break to avoid a collision (evasive manoeuvre). Notably, elements outside of the cyclist and driver involved in the incident were found to play a role. These contributing factors related to the road infrastructure, vehicles, cyclists, other road users and environmental conditions. The implications for road design are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Attending to {{cultural}} diversity {{is important for}} products and technology intended for global placement, such as automobiles, yet many products (and associated interfaces) lack genuine cultural differentiation. For example, in-vehicle navigation systems are typically identical in form and function across world markets, differing only in the local language and map database. To capture and explore culturally-salient design factors, we utilised a scenario-based design methodology, involving 6 experienced drivers from the UK and Malaysia. Participants were asked to portray their ideal navigation system interface designs – by drawing pictograms and devising accompanying spoken messages – to direct drivers along 3 prescribed routes in the UK, Malaysia and Japan. Routes were presented using video and paper maps, with the order of presentation counterbalanced between groups; participants were not told in advance from which country each route was derived. Proposed designs highlight differences at a country level, which are consequently interpreted from a cultural perspective. For example, Malaysian drivers included a higher density of navigational elements in their designs, particularly in their home environment, compared to UK drivers. Malaysian drivers also created more incremental designs, particularly on the <b>approach</b> to a <b>manoeuvre,</b> suggesting a desire for greater navigational support {{at this point in}} the journey. Landmarks were consistently incorporated in designs, but differences were noted in cultural salience. Additionally, the phrasing of instructions (e. g. “go straight on”), nomenclature for road elements (e. g. ‘roundabout’) and distance declaration conventions (e. g. units) differed at a country level. The findings can be used to inform the design of culturally-attuned in-vehicle navigation systems...|$|R
40|$|Safety of {{navigation}} is especially challenging and critical when a ship <b>approaches</b> and <b>manoeuvres</b> in harbour areas. Improving the safety {{especially in the}} first and last phase of a voyage is crucial and requires measures addressing both the human and technical-technological elements including support systems that shall provide human operators with information relevant for decision making. The present situation is characterized by the introduction of numerous sophisticated technical and support systems often integrated with several components becoming increasingly complex. On the users end, changes are not that obvious and not that rapid as for technology. However, new approaches are under development or already in use. They are characterized by applying and adapting solutions from other transport modes. In this way, tasks and procedures on ships, that are highly safety-relevant and containing high portions of manoeuvring activities have been changed to high back-up procedures as in air planes. For port manoeuvres e. g. the system of pilot/co-pilot was introduced on ferries in a sense that one officer is operating and the other is monitoring and checking the safe performance. In cruise shipping, new structures replacing the traditional rank-based with a flexible system based on job functions. This system creates a kind of a safety net around the person conning the vessel. Each operation is cross checked before execution by one or two other persons. The first obvious consequence is higher costs due to doubling personnel. On the other hand there is also a need for a technology appropriately supporting the checking officer by enabling her or him to monitor what the conning officer is doing. “Fast-Time Manoeuvring Simulation Technology” (FTS) developed at the Institute for Innovative Ship Simulation and Maritime Systems (ISSIMS) has huge potential to fulfil this task. FTS calculates within one second of computing time up to 1000 seconds of real manoeuvring time by a very complex ship-dynamic simulation model for rudder, engine and thruster manoeuvres. It enables prompt prediction of all manoeuvres carried out by the conning officer for the observing officer, too. Predictions of path and motion status allow all officers to see whether the manoeuvring actions have at least the correct tendency or indicating the need for corrections. This new type of support is called Simulation-Augmented Manoeuvring Design and Monitoring (SAMMON) – it allows not only overlooking the next manoeuvring segment ahead but also for the following or even for series of manoeuvring segments. This technology has been used within two research projects: COSINUS (Co-operative Ship Operation in Integrated Maritime Traffic Systems) set out for implementing FTS into integrated ship bridges and to also communicate the manoeuvre plans and display it to VTS centres. Within the European project MUNIN (Maritime Unmanned Navigation through Intelligence in Networks) this technology has been used to investigate if it is possible to steer autonomous ships, in case it would be necessary...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the use of inverse simulation to help identify those regions of a ship's flight deck which provide the safest locations for landing a rotorcraft in various atmospheric conditions. This requires appropriate information on the wind loading conditions around a ship deck and superstructure, and for the current work, these data were obtained from wind tunnel tests of a ship model representative of a typical helicopter carrier/assault ship. A series of wind tunnel tests were carried out on the model in the University of Glasgow's 2. 65 × 2. 04 m wind tunnel and three-axis measurements of wind speed were made at various locations on the ship deck. Measurements were made at four locations on the flight deck at three different heights. The choice of these locations was made on the basis of preliminary flow visualization tests which highlighted the areas where the most severe wind effects were most likely to occur. In addition, for the case where the wind was from 30 to starboard, measurements were made at three further locations to assess the extent of the wake of the superstructure. The generated wind profiles can then be imposed on the inverse simulation, allowing study of the vehicle and pilot response during a typical landing manoeuvre in these conditions. The power of the inverse simulation for this application is demonstrated by a series of simulations performed using configurational data representing two aircraft types, a Westland Lynx and a transport helicopter flying an <b>approach</b> and landing <b>manoeuvre</b> with the worst atmospheric conditions applied. It is shown from the results that attempting to land in the area aft of the superstructure in a 30 ° crosswind might lead to problems for the transport configuration due to upgusts in this area. Attempting to perform the landing manoeuvre in an aggressive manner is also shown to lead to diminished control margin in higher winds...|$|R
40|$|The modern Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) used in {{airlines}} {{today is}} the TCAS II. It provides pilots with both Traffic Advisory (TA) and Resolution Advisory (RA) which in turn reduces the incidence of mid-air collisions. It was demonstrated that TCAS could provide safety and economy benefits for airlines nowadays. However, as the demand for commercial air travels increases, it exerted {{a considerable amount of}} strain on the current ‘traditional’ TCAS system. This is primarily due to the increase in competition for airspace. Trajectory-based TCAS systems have been proposed to overcome the emerging difficulties with collision avoidance. To date, TCAS systems only provide vertical 2 D guidance for the aircraft, that is to say, that the pilot only receives a ‘Climb’ or ‘Descend’ indicator with minimalistic visual cues. The following thesis proposes a new visual cueing method which integrates 3 D trajectory path planning for TCAS system. In general, Head-up Display (HUD) instrumentation provides the pilot with primary flight display, navigation and guidance information pertaining to the aircraft’s states. It is especially useful during the critical flight phases, such as <b>approach,</b> landing and <b>manoeuvring.</b> Furthermore, as the HUD is located in the direct front field of view, it allows the pilot to keep his her head up while performing special tasks. It has been demonstrated that the HUD adds a substantial safety benefit as well as mitigating pilot workload. Thus a conceptual HUD has been proposed and was used in this project, the developed TCAS manoeuvre display and conflict alerts were superimposed on HUD. A Boeing 747 aircraft model developed in the MATLAB Simulink environment has been integrated with a 3 D trajectory-based TCAS system. Perspective projection techniques were addressed for TCAS resolution display and were developed in Java. The resolution display utilizes 3 D tunnel-in-thesky concept as an advanced visual cue. TCAS traffic indications and aural announcements were implemented using Java and MATLAB respectively. The HUD concept was designed in the de-cluttered format in accordance with FAR 25. 1321 SAE ARP 5288 standards, and was also developed in Java language. It maximised compatibility with head down display. Finally, the impact of the developed visual cueing methods were discussed and assessed through scenario trials. This thesis presents an account of the work done within the scope. It underlines the main considerations of the design, how scenarios were implemented and their measurements. The research indicated that tunnel-in-the-sky was an appropriate display solution for trajectory-based collision avoidance. It has the advantage of presenting the predictive flight path in an intuitive and natural way...|$|R
