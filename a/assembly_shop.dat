25|$|The company {{started as}} an <b>assembly</b> <b>shop.</b> The boat hulls were {{purchased}} from other boatbuilders, such as Turun Veneveistämö, {{and they were}} equipped with American Fay & Bowen engines. The business developed rapidly, and already in 1907 the men bought a lot for larger premises in Aura riverside close to Korppolaismäki. They invested heavily on facilities; in 1909 the works covered a two-floor brickhouse with a forging shop, <b>assembly</b> <b>shop,</b> boiler room, wood drying room and galvanising shop. The boats were built in a large boathouse and launched on two slipways. The main building was for offices and material stock, which was in two floors total 1270 m². The risk proved profitable; During the first two operating years the company produced 120 boats and sold 367 engines of different makes.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the high quality of his steam engines, sales {{increased}} a great deal and it became apparent that a new engine <b>assembly</b> <b>shop</b> was required. Murray designed this himself, and produced a huge three-storeyed circular building known as the Round Foundry. This contained a centrally mounted steam engine to power all of the machines in the building. Murray also built a house for himself adjoining the works. The design of this was pioneering, as each room was heated by steam pipes, so that it became known locally as Steam Hall.|$|E
25|$|The Viva {{remained}} on sale {{until the end}} of 1979, when the Opel Kadett D was launched. It was intended that this car would also be produced in America and the UK, as the second generation Chevette, but due to various industrial issues at the time GM decided to shelve most of the Ellesmere Port Plant, retaining only the <b>assembly</b> <b>shop</b> to build the new car. These would be produced from 'knock-down' kits shipped from Opel's Russelsheim plant. Due to the huge loss of workforce which this would cause, representations were made which resulted in the decision to continue production of existing models alongside the new. This meant that a new name would have to be found for Vauxhall's version of the new Opel Kadett, and so in March 1980 the Vauxhall Astra was born, replacing the Viva in the Vauxhall range, while the Chevette {{remained on}} sale until 1984. At this time, the planned mothballing of the major proportion of the Ellesmere Port Plant went ahead as originally planned.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{operations}} carried out by 150 Wing comprised high-altitude fighter sweeps, offensive operations known as [...] "Rangers", as well as reconnaissance missions. Prior to the Normandy landings, Tempests would routinely conduct long-range sorties inside enemy territory and penetrate into Northern France and the Low Countries, {{using a combination of}} cannons and bombs to attack airfields, radar installations, ground vehicles, coastal shipping and the launch sites for the German V-1 flying bombs. The build-up of Tempest-equipped squadrons was increased rapidly, in part due to factors such as the V-1 threat, although a labour strike in Hawker's <b>assembly</b> <b>shop</b> adversely affected this rate; by September 1944, a total of five frontline Tempest squadrons which comprised 114 aircraft were in operation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an <b>assembly</b> job <b>shop</b> {{scheduling}} problem considering two phases of control: order review/release (ORR) and dispatching rules. Dispatching rules have been intensively used in earlier job shop research. Such rules determine the processing sequence of jobs {{waiting in the}} queues of corresponding machines. In recent years, ORR emerges as another option for job shop control and has received increasing attention. Such control determines when to release jobs to the shop floor. Different ORR mechanisms have been devised and are reported to bring several advantages such as reduced inventory cost of early finished orders, controlled and balanced shop load levels and shorter order flow time. Previous studies on ORR often assume a simplified job <b>shop</b> without <b>assembly</b> operations, while this research applies ORR to an <b>assembly</b> job <b>shop.</b> The aim {{of this research is}} to evaluate the ability of different combinations of ORR-dispatching rules in optimising due date and flow time related performance measures. Full factorial experiment has been designed for a simulated <b>assembly</b> job <b>shop.</b> Results show that both ORR and dispatching rules are highly relevant with respect to the due date and flow time related performance measures. Particularly, the incorporation of ORR control into the existing control of dispatching rules is highly important for better performance of <b>assembly</b> job <b>shop</b> control. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
