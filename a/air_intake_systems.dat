40|$|The {{performance}} of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> in a diesel engine could limit the overall engine performance. The intake manifold {{is an important part}} of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> where enough <b>air</b> should be guided to the cylinder. Compactness is a conflicting feature to performance as engine rooms in general, and thereby engines, should use little space. Thus, the development of an <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> manifold requires knowledge about function and placement of most other parts in the engine so that a compatible and compact <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> manifold can be created. MarineDiesel AB is a Swedish company from Ängelholm developing and manufacturing marine diesel engines. The Master thesis project work has been performed in a real project where an engine, previously used in a train, is converted into a marine engine with twice the power. The engine must be designed to fit with the new requirements of the customer. These requirements directly affect the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> which must, as all other engine system, match the desired performance. A well-defined development process with theoretical and practical research together with company guidelines and engineering assessments has generated the concepts in this product development master thesis project. Two different intake manifold concepts have been created. The concepts are different in aspect to both manifold design and <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> configuration.

The focus has been set on creating flexible feasible concepts that are possible to manufacture when adapted to future requirements. This creates the best possible prerequisites of implementation later in the project. In other words, the design limitations should be low in this stage of the project and thus the two final concepts are only conceptual and not ready for production.

The fuel will more effectively stay in suspension in the air rather than falling out of suspension and forming droplets {{on the floor of the}} manifold. Warm air from the outside of an exhaust manifold is drawn up into the air cleaner to increase the air temperature as quickly as possible after the engine starts. The air cleaner assembly incorporates a thermostatic vacuum switch that responds to the air temperature after the air filter element and actuates a vacuum motor that moves the control flap to allow the air to be drawn from a cooler location such as the top of the engine bay or outside the engine bay. If the air becomes too cold, the thermostatic switch will automatically change back to drawing heated air from around the outside of the exhaust.|$|E
5000|$|Fuel {{economy was}} poor, for the turbine {{consumed}} roughly {{twice as much}} fuel as an equally powerful diesel engine. This was initially not a problem, because Union Pacific's turbines burned Bunker C heavy fuel oil that was less expensive than diesel. But this highly viscous fuel is difficult to handle, with a room-temperature consistency similar to tar or molasses. To solve this problem, a heater was built into the fuel tanks (and later into fuel tenders) to heat the fuel to [...] before feeding it into the turbine. Eventually UP switched from Bunker C to modified No. 6 heavy fuel oil, which contained fewer pollutants and solvents. Soot buildup and blade erosion caused by corrosive ash plagued all of the turbines.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> of {{internal}} combustion engines are comprised of ducts and air boxes (e. g. air cleaner). The lengths of the ducts induce resonances {{that may be}} excited by the air pulsations generated by the air intake valves of the engine. In cases of loud air intake noise, when acoustic devices cannot be used to counteract resonances, a common solution is to use porous ducts: non woven ducts, or ducts with slits (considered as local porosities). Such a solution has an important drawbacks: (1) Dust can fill the pores, leading to loss of effectiveness; (2) The acoustic power radiated along the duct increases. The last issue is addressed here with measurements: the acoustic power radiated along the duct is compared to the acoustic power radiated by the nozzle, in different conditions (with or without porosity, homogeneous or discrete porosity, various airflow velocities). The aim is to validate that porosities give a good balance between the decrease of nozzle noise resonances and the increase of radiated noise along the duct...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to select a better air intake system for a new fire laboratory, designed for experiments with a maximum fire heat release rate of 7 MW. Two different <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> are considered: a louver system around the lower perimeter of the building or a chimney system that employs vertical ducts to bring fresh air down from the roof to {{the lower part of}} the building. The two systems are investigated with different fire sizes and wind speeds. The results show that the chimney system gives a more stable smoke and temperature stratification inside the building and a higher hot smoke layer above the floor. The louver system, on the other hand, gives rise to unsymmetrical air movements inside the building when the wind speed outside is high. The louver system also yields a lower hot smoke layer that can spill smoke through the louvers to the outside of the building, especially for small fires with low exhaust flow rates. The results, therefore, suggest that an evenly distributed chimney system would provide a more stable ventilation environment for conducting fire experiments and would prevent smoke leakage to the outside of the building.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of the acoustic properties of an automotive air intake system. Modern <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> for personal cars are largely made of plastic materials. When trying to make an acoustic model for the sound transmission through the intake system it is questionable if the walls of different components can be modelled as acoustically rigid. The acoustic losses which determine the transmitted sound level at breakthrough frequencies may be especially difficult to model. To find out if acoustic losses associated with wall vibrations or with flow interaction are dominating for a typical intake system an experimental investigation has been performed. The acoustic plane-wave transmission matrices have been measured, using the two-source replacement technique, for the complete intake system and for separate parts. Measurements were made in a flow test rig without flow and for two different flow speeds. The measurements were then repeated with sand loading on the walls to reduce wall vibrations. The results indicate that flow related losses dominates at low frequencies while losses associated with acoustically non-rigid walls dominate at higher frequencies, giving an additional transmission loss in the order of 2 dB for the complete system. Both effects will therefore have {{to be taken into account}} in an accurate model. Comparisons will also be made between results from an acoustic FE-model and experimental results.

40|$|Abstract Automotive engine {{manufacturers}} are focusing increasingly {{their attention on}} noise generated by <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular {{in recent years the}} increased usage of plastics for air intake manifold (AIM) production, in place of metallic materials, made the NVH optimization more complicated. In this framework, it is very important not only the minimization of the noise generated via fluid propagation (orifice-noise from inlets) but also of the noise radiated via the coupled fluid-structure interaction. In this work acoustical performance of an AIM prototype has been experimentally and numerically investigated. From the experimental point of view, the acoustic analysis was performed by means of acoustic intensity measurements around the body. In order to minimize the noise contribution from all the other sources of an operating engine, the AIM was assembled on an engine head which was mounted on a dynamic flow test bench, where the intake valve-train was driven by an electrical motor. The intake orifice noise was differently treated, both leaving the orifice open and employing a dissipative muffler. Simulations through a coupled fluid-structure approach were performed. The normal modes of the structure were previously calculated on a fully-detailed FEM model and checked through accelerometric data; material properties could then be properly chosen. Measured data of the pressure pulsations at the inlet valves was used as excitation and applied to a coarsened acoustic Indirect-BEM model of the AIM coupled with a structural FEM one. Tuning of experimental and numerical acoustic data was useful for defining a practical analysis procedure for NVH design of plastic AIMs. 1...|$|E

Progeny loss increased steeply with length of the tubing, decreasing sampling efficiency to 66  % for 8. 2  mm ID rolled-up tubing of 200  m length at a flow rate of ca. 1  m 3  h − 1. Preliminary theoretical estimation of the loss yielded a sampling efficiency of 64  % for the same tubing, when taking into account turbulent inertial deposition of aerosol to the walls as well as loss due to gravitational settling.
