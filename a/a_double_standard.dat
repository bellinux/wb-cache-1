5|$|During the 1946 postseason, rumors {{began to}} swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was {{lobbying}} Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher {{to leave the}} Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin {{an investigation into the}} gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor George Raft. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—Chuck Dressen and John Corriden—as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris while they were still employed by the Dodgers. Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.|$|E

Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|The legal code of Moroland was reformed. Disputes between Moros and non-Christians {{had been}} left to Moro laws and customs, with Philippine laws only {{applying}} to disputes with Christians.

Wood attempted to codify Moro law, but there was simply too much variance in laws and customs between the different tribes and even between neighboring cottas. Wood placed the Moros underneath the Philippine criminal code, but actual enforcement of this proved difficult.|$|E

Asked to assist in administering the electroshock, Sister Jude is disturbed by the violence of the resulting treatment. In the woods, Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) asks Dr. Arden to tell her the identity of the creatures in the woods who savagely eat the meat she prepares for them. Later, Shelley (Chloë Sevigny) offers herself to Dr. Arden in return for fifteen minutes outside. He rebuffs her, calling her a slut and a whore, leading Shelley to argue that women face <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> with their sexuality, and that she was committed by her promiscuous husband who hypocritically forbade her from engaging in extramarital sex.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sources have}} {{discussed}} <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> regarding {{the conduct of}} female versus male teachers. When it comes to sexual harassment or sexual abuse cases involving a male teacher as the perpetrator to a female student, severe punishments are often the result. According to David Ring, a lawyer working with sexual abuse cases, {{it is not uncommon}} for the male teachers to be convicted, face jail time, or owe partial civil damages to the student victim depending on the severity of the case. When a female teacher is the perpetrator of sexual harassment to a male student, there are arguments that the female teachers are given lighter sentences and the male victims are given lower amounts of compensation due to the reasoning that teenage males would be willing to have sexual encounters with older, female teachers as a response to changes in their hormones.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> in {{adolescence}} {{has important implications}} for sexual development and gender inequality. The present study uses longitudinal social network data (N = 914; 11 – 16 years of age) to test if gender moderates associations between adolescents’ sexual behaviors and peer acceptance. Consistent with <b>a</b> traditional sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> female adolescents who reported having sex had significant decreases in peer acceptance over time, whereas male adolescents reporting the same behavior had significant increases in peer acceptance. This pattern was observed net of respondents’ own perceived friendships, further suggesting that the social responses to sex vary by gender of the sexual actor. However, findings for “making out” showed <b>a</b> reverse <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> such that female adolescents reporting this behavior had increases in peer acceptance and male adolescents reporting the same behavior had decreases in peer acceptance over time. Results thus suggest that peers enforce traditional sexual scripts for both “heavy” and “light” sexual behaviors during adolescence. These findings have important implications for sexual health education, encouraging educators to develop curricula that emphasize the gendered social construction of sexuality and to combat inequitable and stigmatizing peer responses to real or perceived deviations from traditional sexual scripts...|$|R

However, Denmark has no such laws and there wasand still isno EU-wide law against holocaust denial. Randall Hansen said that laws against holocaust denial were not directly comparable with restrictions on social satire, so could not be considered <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> unless one believed in an absolute right to freedom of speech, and that those who do would doubtless oppose holocaust denial laws.

40|$|The sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> {{dictates}} {{that men and}} women are evaluated differently for equivalent sexual behaviour, such that men are socially praised, and women are socially derogated. Previous studies, however, have only investigated the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when men and women engage in sexual behaviour, whereas the aim of this study examines whether the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> exists when individuals say “no” to casual sex, and whether benevolent sexism impacts this. One hundred and fifty-six Australian undergraduate students participated in an online questionnaire. It was hypothesised that the woman would be rated more positively when she refuses rather than accepts a casual sexual encounter, and, contrarily, the man would be rated more negatively when he refuses rather than accepts a casual sexual encounter. Benevolent sexism was also expected to have an effect on participants’ ratings of each target, such that those high in benevolent sexism would rate the female target more positively when she refuses rather than accepts the casual sexual encounter. Additionally, responses to an open-ended question were predicted to reveal the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when engaging in sexual behaviour. Results showed evidence of <b>a</b> sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when targets engaged in casual sex, as well as initial evidence of <b>a</b> sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when they refused casual sex. Contrarily, benevolent sexism was found to have no effect on ratings of the targets, and likewise, no sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for the engagement in sexual activity was revealed by responses to the open-ended question...|$|R
