This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> (or a contrate gear) is a gear {{which has}} teeth that project {{at right angles}} to the face of the wheel. In particular, <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> isa type of bevel gear where the pitch cone angle is 90 degrees. [...] A pitch cone of any other angle is simply called a bevel gear.

The test case milled a forged blank for <b>a</b> <b>Crown</b> Wheel <b>Gear</b> on <b>an</b> older Mazak VQC 20. Accuracy data from the machine was combined with tool engagement information from the STEP-NC to predict the deflections, which were tested against actual machining results.|$|R
50|$|In general, the sidewinder and anglewinder {{are less}} common {{arrangements}} than the inline motor, {{in which the}} shaft is perpendicular to the driven axle, and drives it with bevel gears or <b>a</b> pinion and <b>crown</b> <b>gear,</b> and historically at least, less common than the pancake motor, in which the shaft is vertical and power is carried to the axle by a chain of gears through <b>a</b> pinion and <b>crown</b> arrangement.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, {{very few}} {{motorcycles}} were available with shaft final drive. BMW's {{were the most}} common. The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm, unlike BMW's previous models, and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with <b>a</b> coupler <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> keyed to the drive pinion. This meant that leaking seals could become {{a problem for the}} owners. Because the clutch was dry, there were seals {{at the rear of the}} crankshaft, at both ends of the transmission, at the rear of the driveshaft, and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit: lots of seals to develop leaks.|$|R
50|$|Crown gears or contrate gears are a {{particular}} form of bevel gear whose teeth project {{at right angles to}} the plane of the wheel; in their orientation the teeth resemble the points on a crown. <b>A</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> can only mesh accurately with another bevel gear, although crown gears are sometimes seen meshing with spur gears. <b>A</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> is also sometimes meshed with an escapement such as found in mechanical clocks.|$|E
50|$|Bevel gears {{that have}} pitch angles of exactly 90 degrees have teeth that point outward {{parallel}} with the axis and resemble the points on a crown. That's why this type of bevel gear is called <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the model}} car hobby, an inline {{car is a}} type of slot car or other {{motorized}} model car in which the motor shaft runs lengthwise down the chassis, perpendicular to the driven axle (usually the rear).

50|$|A similar type of slot car {{which has}} the motor shaft mounted {{at an angle to}} the driven axle is the Anglewinder. In general, the sidewinder and anglewinder are less common {{arrangements}} than the inline motor, in which the shaft is perpendicular to the driven axle, and drives it with bevel gears or <b>a</b> pinion and <b>crown</b> <b>gear.</b> Historically, they are also less common than the pancake motor, in which the shaft is vertical and power is carried to the axle by a chain of gears to <b>a</b> pinion and <b>crown</b> arrangement. Because they require more space between the drive wheels, the sidewinder and anglewinder arrangements are more common in 1:32, and especially 1:24, than in the smaller scales.|$|R

5000|$|The pancake motor, {{as used in}} slot cars, {{is a type of}} {{electric}} motor, which has a flat commutator and vertical shaft. It was a feature of the highly successful Aurora HO slot cars of the 1960s and 1970s. The motor was not a separate unit; instead, its individual elements - magnets, armature, commutator and brushes - fit into recesses in the blocky chassis. The power was carried by a chain of spur gears {{along the top of the}} chassis, to a pinion which drove <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> at the axle. Like most slot car motors, the Aurora pancakes ran on low voltage direct current.The term 'pancake' is also loosely used to refer to a car or chassis which has such a motor.|$|E

50|$|Geared {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for power, not for speed, and were popular with logging companies {{who had to}} move heavy trains up and down grades safely. Four types of logging locomotives were utilized {{in the early twentieth}} century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which actuate rods attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of actuating rods for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear.</b> The Heisler configured geared-locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a central axle. This central axle was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the logging locomotives is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a central axle, thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} a relative screw motion {{of a pair of}} internal and external spiral bevel gears with double circular-arc tooth profile in a nutation drive by screw theory and focuses on the kinematic modeling for the nutation drive. According to the instantaneous screw motion theory, the meshing function of the nutation drive for the kinematic modeling is developed based on the gear meshing theory and the coordinate system transformation between <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> and an internal or an external spiral bevel gear. The equations for the tooth profile of the crown gear, internal and external spiral bevel gears are further obtained based on the standard double circular-arc tooth profile and equal strength principles. Finally, the controllable precision three dimension modeling method for the tooth profile of the external and internal spiral bevel gears is further proposed...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experimental}} research, an analysis was carried out {{of the effect of}} certain errors in manufacture of straight-barrel slots on the noise characteristics of gear drives. In carrying out the experiments, the <b>gear</b> <b>crowns</b> of the test wheels were held immovable, and only the geometric dimensions of the slots and the mutual locations of the individual elements were varied. The investigation of the effect of each factor was carried out under otherwise equal conditions, on 34 : 56 cog ratio gear pairs (m = 2 mm), made of 40 C steel, with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>crown</b> accuracy of 7 X, machining fineness 7, at a speed v = 7. 1 m/sec. The number of slots was 6. The clearance in slot pairs in dimension D, equal to 0. 015, 0. 05, 0. 08 and 0. 110 mm, was obtained by change in the outer diameter of the spindle by means of polishing.

40|$|In many aeroengines the {{accessory}} power offtake is achieved using a {{spiral bevel gear}} set running {{off one of the}} main shafts. The <b>crown</b> and bevel <b>gears</b> are housed in an internal gearbox. Over the past few years the Nottingham University Technology Centre (UTC) in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems has researched flow near spiral bevel gears both computationally and experimentally using a purpose-built test rig. In the current investigation the rig was configured with <b>a</b> Trent <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> and slightly modified shroud covering the full 360 ° of the gear. No external containment chamber was fitted and all testing was conducted single-phase (air only) at 5, 000 rpm. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) was used to obtain the three components of flow velocity at a shroud exit slot and at shroud inlet. A 2 D system was utilised and thus two measurements were required at each point to give the 3 velocity components. The LDA technique enabled detailed mapping of flow features over the chosen regions, which included areas very near the shroud surfaces. Data was obtained over two measurement regions: 1) a volume mapping the air “jet” exiting the shroud exit slot at top dead centre (TDC) and 2) an area capturing the flow structures local to the shroud inlet. Combined the results form an excellent set of high quality, detailed, 3 -component flow data for direct use in validating CFD models and/or to define CFD boundary conditions. At the shroud exit slot the maximum velocity measured was 46. 2 m/s with the jet velocity dispersing over the measurement volume such that by 26 mm from slot plane the maximum velocity was less than 20 m/s. The jet angle was found to be only 16 ° off perpendicular azimuthally and 22 ° down from perpendicular. Data from the top 5 slots shows good similarity indicating the detailed data for the TDC slot is probably applicable to all slots. Air entering the shroud comes down the shroud face and up the rotating end face of the gear shaft. The azimuthal velocity component at shroud inlet was around 20 m/s; this is of the order of 50...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, amagnetic {{planetary}} gear drive is proposed and its operating principle is introduced. The equationsof the geometrics andkinematics for thedrive are given. The equations {{of the magnetic}} induction intensity for the magnetic gear teeth are deduced. The equations of the torques between the {{planetary gear}}s and sun <b>gear</b> or <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> are developed. The available parameters of the magnetic planetary drive are presented and the magnetic flux density distri-butions of the magnetic gear teeth are investigated. The torques between the planetary gears and sun <b>gear</b> or <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> are analysed. When the relative rotating angle between the gears is increased, the magnetic torque grows, gets to a maximum value, and then drops. The maximum torque represents extreme load-carrying ability of the drive system. The pole pair number, the tooth thickness and the tooth width of the magnetic gears, and the speed ratio of the drive have obvious influence on the output torques. To obtain a large magnetic torque, a large tooth width of the gear, a proper pole pair number, a proper radial thickness of the tooth, a large planetary gear number, and a large speed ratio should be chosen...|$|R
