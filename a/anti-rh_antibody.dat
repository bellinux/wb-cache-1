An analysis {{has also been}} made of the capacity of non-specific human IgG, aggregated non-specific human IgG, human IgM (19 S) and IgM (7 S), and of fragments Fcgamma, Fcmu and Fc 5 mu to inhibit the agglutination of trypsinized ORh+ red cells by the IgG incomplete <b>anti-Rh</b> <b>antibody.</b> The results obtained indicate that these antibodies behave in a similar manner to that of nonprecipitating antibodies, and that the agglutination of trypsinized red cells seems to be a mixed reaction due to the interaction of an Fab fragment with its Rh antigenic determinant present in the surface of a red cell and the Fc of the same molecule with a receptor for Fc present in adjacent red cells. The trypsin treatment apparently results in the liberation of occult Fc receptors. It has also been demonstrated that in the agglutination of ORh+ red cells by IgG incomplete <b>anti-Rh</b> <b>antibody</b> in the presence of albumin, interaction must occur in some manner between the albumin and the Fc fragment since the F(ab') 2 fragment does not give rise to agglutination under such conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{serological}} and physicochemical {{properties of}} the following three forms of human anti-γ-globulin factors were compared: (a) rheumatoid factors; (b) Milgrom type anti-γ-globulin factors; and (c) factors directed against an antigen in human γG-globulin that is hidden in the intact molecule and revealed by enzymatic digestion at low pH. The property common to these factors is ability to interact with human γG-globulin; they are distinguishable because they react with different antigenic groups on this molecule. In all of five sera, the Milgrom type anti-γ-globulin factors were γM-globulins. They reacted with various human γG-globulin antibodies but failed to interact with γM-globulin type antibodies in agglutination and absorption experiments. When isolated from other anti-γ-globulin factors, they agglutinated red cells coated with intact anti-Rh antibodies, but failed to react with cells cells coated with pepsin-digested <b>anti-Rh</b> <b>antibody.</b> These observations indicate that the agglutinator reacts with the crystallizable, inert fragment of γG-globulin. Anti-γ-globulin activity directed against an antigen in human γG-globulin revealed by pepsin digestion was demonstrated in γG-, γA-, and γM-globulins. This anti-γ-globulin factor could be absorbed by antigen-antibody precipitates containing human antibody, which shows that the hidden antigen in human γG-globulin is revealed not only by enzymatic digestion at low pH, but also when γG-globulin is present as antibody in an antigen-antibody precipitate. Rheumatoid factors and Milgrom type anti-γ-globulin factors were also absorbed by antigen-antibody precipitates containing human antibody.

A considerable number of babies with erythroblastosis fetalis have higher concentrations of LDH and lower concentra-tions of indirect-reacting bilirubin in their serum than do babies with physiologic jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).

Challenges include antigenic polymorphism, the apparent requirement for exceptionally high antibody concentrations for protection, and clinical-grade production of conformationally-accurate recombinant protein antigens followed by formulation with a human-compatible adjuvant. This thesis describes the generation of viral-vectored vaccines targeting ten less-studied blood-stage antigens, focusing upon antigens implicated in erythrocyte invasion. These vaccines were immunogenic in mice and rabbits. The rabbit antibodies raised were functionally active in the in vitro assay of parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA). GIA with antibodies against one antigen, RH 5, exceeded that achieved with antibodies against the ‘gold standard’ AMA 1 or MSP 1 antigens. This antigen’s amino acid sequence is relatively conserved between parasite strains. Importantly, and unlike anti-AMA 1 and MSP 1 antibodies, the GIA effects transcend genetically diverse strains. It was hypothesised that blockade of the interaction of RH 5 with its receptor basigin {{was likely to be}} a mechanism of action of <b>anti-RH</b> 5 <b>antibodies.</b> Vaccine-induced polyclonal <b>anti-RH</b> 5 serum was found to be capable of blocking this interaction, as well as merozoite attachment to erythrocytes. A panel of RH 5 -specific monoclonal antibodies were raised: those which block the RH 5 -receptor interaction were capable of neutralising parasites. Minimal linear epitopes recognised by these antibodies were mapped, and are likely to be within or close to RH 5 ’s receptor binding site. These data support prompt clinical testing of RH 5 -based vaccines, and shed light upon the mechanism of action of <b>anti-RH</b> 5 <b>antibodies.</b> However substantial challenges remain in establishing whether this antigen, {{selected on the basis of}} the in vitro assay of GIA, will be capable of achieving in vivo protection against P. falciparum.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the role of Drosophila king tubby (ktub) in rhodopsin 1 (Rh 1) endocytosis and retinal degeneration upon light stimulation. Results Drosophila ktub mutants were generated using imprecise excision. Wild type and mutant flies were raised in dark or constant light conditions. After a period of light stimulation, retinas were dissected, fixed and stained with <b>anti-Rh</b> 1 <b>antibody</b> to reveal Rh 1 endocytosis. Confocal and transmission electron microscope were used to examine the retinal degeneration. Immunocytochemical analysis shows that Ktub is expressed in the rhabdomere domain under dark conditions. When flies receive light stimulation, the Ktub translocates from the rhabdomere to the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the photoreceptor cells. Wild type photoreceptors form Rh 1 -immunopositive large vesicles (RLVs) shortly after light stimulation. In light-induced ktub mutants, the majority of Rh 1 remains at the rhabdomere, and only a few RLVs appear in the cytoplasm of photoreceptor cells. Mutation of norpA allele causes massive Rh 1 endocytosis in light stimulation. In ktub and norpA double mutants, however, Rh 1 endocytosis is blocked under light stimulation. This study also shows that ktub and norpA double mutants rescue the light-induced norpA retinal degeneration. Deletion constructs further demonstrate that the Tubby domain of the Ktub protein participates in an important role in Rh 1 endocytosis. Conclusions The results in this study delimit the novel function of Ktub in Rh 1 endocytosis and retinal degeneration. </p...|$|R

We report on the first clinical trial to our knowledge to assess the RH 5 antigen - a dose-escalation phase Ia study in 24 healthy, malaria-naive adult volunteers. We utilized established viral vectors, the replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 (ChAd 63), and the attenuated orthopoxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), encoding RH 5 from the 3 D 7 clone of P. falciparum. Vaccines were administered i. m. in a heterologous prime-boost regimen using an 8 -week interval and were well tolerated. Vaccine-induced <b>anti-RH</b> 5 serum <b>antibodies</b> exhibited cross-strain functional growth inhibition activity (GIA) in vitro, targeted linear and conformational epitopes within RH 5, and inhibited key interactions within the RH 5 invasion complex. This is the first time to our knowledge that substantial RH 5 -specific responses have been induced by immunization in humans, with levels greatly exceeding the serum antibody responses observed in African adults following years of natural malaria exposure. These data support the progression of RH 5 -based vaccines to human efficacy testing...|$|R
