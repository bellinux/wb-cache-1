500|$|As {{a senior}} in 1966, Volk started all 10 games at safety and also started 2 games at fullback, and even started one game as quarterback. At the {{conclusion}} of the 1966 season, he was selected as a first-team All-American by the Sporting News. [...] At the conclusion of his college football career at Michigan, the Newspaper Editors Association distributed a feature story on Volk, describing him as follows:"Rick Volk is a safety man who conjures up an image of homemade apple pie and pancakes smothered in maple syrup, Saturday night movies and picnics in a wooded grove. He is clear-eyed and smooth-cheeked, with a short tilted nose and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> shows white. He couldn't be more pure mid-Americana if he were framed by a billboard." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, the hint of <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first going {{to be involved in the}} editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. [...] "Toxic" [...] is Spears's most expensive music video to date, at a cost of $1 million.|$|E

[...] Aden {{has been described as}} a [...] "good looking guy with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> melts every heart." [...] Aden is initially portrayed as an [...] "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" [...] where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E

2500|$|Stokowski {{appeared}} as {{himself in the}} motion picture The Big Broadcast of 1937, conducting two of his Bach transcriptions. That same year he also conducted and acted in One Hundred Men and a Girl, with Deanna Durbin and Adolphe Menjou. In 1939, Stokowski collaborated with Walt Disney to create the motion picture {{for which he is}} best known: Fantasia. He conducted all the music (with the exception of a [...] "jam session" [...] {{in the middle of the}} film) and included his own orchestrations for the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria segments. Stokowski even got to talk to (and shake hands with) Mickey Mouse on screen, although he would later say with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> Mickey Mouse got to shake hands with him. This footage of Stokowski was incorporated into Fantasia 2000.|$|E

2500|$|... 1) One of {{the stories}} talks about an event that {{occurred}} in a past life of Ashoka, {{when he was a}} small child named Jaya. Once when Jaya was playing on the roadside, the Buddha came by. The young child put a handful of earth in the Buddha’s begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become a great emperor and follower of the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have smiled <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> “illuminated the universe with its rays of light”. These rays of light are then said to have re-entered the Buddha’s left palm, signifying that this child Jaya would, in his next life, become a great emperor. The Buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple Ananda and is said to have predicted that this child would be “a great, righteous chakravarti king, who would rule his empire from his capital at Pataliputra”.|$|E
2500|$|Another famous Princeton alum {{who played}} for Cappon is Sports Illustrated writer Frank Deford. [...] Deford played on Princeton's {{practice}} squad while covering the varsity team for the campus newspaper. [...] Cappon once set Deford straight about his talents, telling him, [...] "Deford, you write basketball better than you play it." [...] Deford later wrote the following about Cappon:"In a profession in which men are renowned for their behavior during a basketball game, Cappy Cappon stood quite by himself among coaches. Until the game was over, the man never did anything but frown. There were degrees of frowning, of course, but his gamut of expression seldom ventured too far {{from that of a}} basic frown. A mournful frown, a disinterested frown, and if it was possible -- and it was -- a frown of satisfaction[...] [...] [...] And when something happened that there wasn't a frown to express completely, Cappy would cup his hands or rise to his feet and bellow the words: `What'rya doin' out there?' When the game was over, the frown would stay quite in place if Princeton lost. But if they won, he would finally smile just a bit, <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> looked both modest and embarrassed." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to MTV News, {{the video}} was well {{received}} by fans, who praised its simplicity and Knowles [...] "bumpin belly". For the week ending October 29, 2011, the music video for [...] "Countdown" [...] debuted at {{number one on}} Yahoo! Video chart. The writers of Stereogum ranked it at number one on their year-end list of the best music videos of 2011. The video was placed on Pitchfork Media's unranked list of The Top Music Videos of 2011, and at number four {{on the list of}} Consequence of Sound's staff, who wrote: [...] "The flawless makeup and choreography coupled (yes, that was intentional) with calculatedly goofy facial expressions and dancing maintain the tenuous balance between idol Sasha Fierce and Bey, the girl next door. It proves to her audience that even though Beyoncé is rapidly ascending the celebrity ladder to an almost untouchable height, she's just like any other girl who secretly wants to be Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face." [...] The writers of Slant Magazine put the music video at number 17 on their list of The 25 Best Music Videos of 2011, writing that [...] "using jolts of pop-art colors, virtuosic editing, and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> spans from one tip of her bob cut to the other, Beyoncé pilfers through a very specific musical past with her customarily giddy and sincere sense of spirit." [...] Jesse Skinner	of Toro magazine put the music video at number 14 on his list of Best Videos of 2011 and noted that the video was [...] "the most energetic clip of the year, a utilization of all things – colour, composition, movement, editing – that used to make major label music videos 'events.'" [...] Phoebe Reilly of Spin ranked the video at number nine on Spins 10 Most Innovative Music Videos of 2011 list, writing that Knowles looked [...] "damn adorable" [...] while channeling Audrey Hepburn. NMEs writers included [...] "Countdown"'s music video at number eight on their list of 50 Best Music Videos of 2011 praising the rolling, multiple split screens as its highlight. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number four on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, writing that the star of the video is her growing Blue Ivy baby bump. As of January 2015, Billboard named the video as the sixth best music video of the 2010s (so far).|$|E
