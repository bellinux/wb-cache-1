Patterson-Rabon stated that the book [...] "sings" [...] like the song from which it got its title. Journey made an emotional impact on Clark, who stated: [...] "The reader can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> her voice through the written words." [...] Paul D.

In a five-star review, Down Beat magazine's Don DeMicheal called Money Jungle [...] "astonishing" [...] and {{described}} Roach and Mingus as [...] "some of the fastest company around." [...] He repeatedly praised Mingus for pushing Ellington into new musical territory: [...] "I've never heard Ellington play as he does on this album; Mingus and Roach, especially Mingus, push him so strongly that one can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Ellington show them who's boss – and he dominates both of them, which is no mean accomplishment." [...] Billboard was also positive, describing it as [...] "memorable" [...] for its content as well as [...] "the historical importance of the three playing together".|$|E

This {{collection}} of hoary old standards is {{the next best thing}} to testing that proposition directly." [...] Orange Coast praised Nelson's performance of the standards: [...] "Willie Nelson is perhaps the finest male singer in country music [...] his phrasing and sense of understated drama have caused him to be compared with the best jazz singers. Now he's released an album of old pop standards, Stardust (Columbia), and you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the stirrings of an outlaw uprising between the grooves [...] although is definitively no step forward in Nelson's career, it's still a pleasurable showcase of his considerable artistry as a vocalist. Plus even though he's dealing with the sophisticated likes of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Kurt Weill, he remains essentially country".|$|E
500|$|Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in 2009's , the second film in the highly popular vampire series. In its review, Rolling Stone said: [...] "Late in the film, a real actor, Michael Sheen, shows up as the mind-reading Aro, of the Italian Volturi vampires, and sparks things up. You can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the young cast thinking, 'Is that acting? It looks hard.' So Sheen is quickly ushered out." [...] While The New York Times said he [...] "preens with plausible menace", USA Today felt he [...] "plays the character with more high-pitched giddiness than menace". He was named Actor of the Year at GQ magazine's annual Men of the Year ceremony. Sheen made two one-off stage appearances in 2009; he performed a scene from Betrayal {{as part of a}} Harold Pinter tribute evening at the National Theatre and performed improvisational comedy as part of The Groundlings' Crazy Joe Show in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E

6000|$|In the {{published}} letters to George Selwyn {{we get a}} mass of correspondence by no means so brilliant and witty as Walpole’s, or so bitter and bright as Hervey’s, but as interesting, and even more descriptive of the time, because the letters are the work of many hands. You hear more voices speaking, as it were, and more natural than Horace’s dandified treble, and Sporus’s malignant whisper. As one reads the Selwyn letters—as one looks at Reynolds’s noble pictures illustrative of those magnificent times and voluptuous people—one <b>almost</b> <b>hears</b> {{the voice of the}} dead past; the laughter and the chorus; the toast called over the brimming cups; the shout at the racecourse or the gaming-table; the merry joke frankly spoken to the laughing fine lady.

500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, girl, you got me froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to how I felt at another moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song and rated it {{four out of five}} stars. He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E
500|$|William Grimes, {{writing in}} the New York Times, {{described}} The Utility of Force as [...] "a closely argued, searching textbook on strategy and the efficient use of military power in the post-Cold War era". Grimes also {{described it as a}} [...] "difficult, challenging book", saying [...] "you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the pointer hit the blackboard as he works his way rigorously through each argument and sub-arguments A, B and C, before proceeding to the next step. At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst the people can easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E

[...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E

"The Big Show was {{not just}} more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, {{smoothly}} produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different," [...] wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio.

Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] But what makes Sacred Evil so interesting is the juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> one spluttering about superstition as you read the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts or whether you just want to curl up with a spine chiller." [...] Chakraverti started working on her third book, tentatively titled Every Strong Woman is a Witch.|$|E
