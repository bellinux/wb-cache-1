In the case of urea, the low efficiency is mainly due to losses by volatilization, which are more pronounced in cultivation systems in which plant residues are left on the soil. The objective of this work was to compare the influence of urea coated with sulfur or boric acid and copper sulfate with conventional N fertilizers on N volatilization losses in sugar cane harvested after stubble burning. The sources urea, sulfur-coated urea, urea coated with boric acid and copper sulfate, as well as nitrate and ammonium sulfate, were tested at amounts containing N rates of 120 kg ha- 1 N. The integration of new technologies in urea fertilization can reduce N losses by volatilization. These losses were most reduced when using nitrate and ammonium sulfate.

40|$|International {{audience}} Abstract: Over {{the past}} two decades, substantial reductions in the deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> (primarily sulphur) have occurred {{in most parts of}} Europe and, following recent agreements, this trend is likely to continue. The question arises as to how have sensitive ecosystems reacted, and will react in the future, to these reduced inputs of acidity? In this paper, the SMART dynamic acidification model predicts the possible recovery of 36 acid-sensitive Finnish headwater lakes, for which both catchment soil and water quality measurements were available. The model was calibrated to measurements by adjusting poorly known parameters; it was then used to simulate soil and water chemistry until 2030 under the ?current legislation scenario' resulting from implementing current European emission reduction agreements. Whereas most of the catchment soils show very little change in base saturation, the positive trends in lake ANC and the negative trends in lake sulphate concentrations, observed over the past decade, continue into the future, albeit at a slower pace. The model predicts that, during 2010 ? 30, all lakes will have reached a positive ANC, a pre-requisite for the recovery of fish populations.

Today, when environmental debate gets a lots of room in media, the environmental impact has to be considered in the decision of which alternative to choose. The report describes the result of a capital budgeting and a simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with a focus on carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide and for the concrete structure of CHABO, a block of student flats at Chalmers university campus. We have compared two different ways to build, on site with in-situ concrete and a facade of bricks and one alternative with precast concrete elements which would serve as a facade. In order to link the economy to the environmental impact the concept of eco-efficiency is used. The results show that the prefabricated option is clearly better with respect to carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions, while emissions of nitrogen oxides and dust are broadly similar.

The depositions were estimated from measurements of {{concentrations in the}} atmosphere and in precipitation. The method has been applied for the Netherlands on a 5 x 5 km 2 scale. The emphasis has been on estimating the deposition fluxes to nature areas in the Netherlands. In 1989 the total potential acid deposition {{was estimated to be}} 4800 mol H+/ha- 1 /a- 1 (28 % SOx, 24 % NOy, 46 % NHx and 2 % HCl). In 1980 the potential acid deposition was estimated to be 6800 mol H+/ha- 1 /a- 1. The decrease in 1989 with respect to 1980 is mainly the result of the lower SOx deposition. Dry deposition on forests in the Netherlands is on the average 20 % higher for SOx, NOy and NHx. Dry deposition on heathland was estimated 10 % higher for SOx, NOy and NHx. Dry deposition on moorland pools was estimated 120 % higher for SOx, 40 % lower for NOy and 90 % higher for NHx than for the average Dutch landscape.

Four chapters deal with the environmental policy proposals of both parties, their results for social developments (primarly traffic, energy and agriculture) and areas of environmental concern and its environmental costs. The outcomes are presented in respect to the first and second National Environmental Policy Plans (NEPP- 1 and NEPP- 2). The main conclusion of this first electoral environmental outlook is that when the proposed environmental measures are fully implemented and enforced, environmental pressures will be further reduced. However, the intended measures of GroenLinks and D 66 are insufficient to achieve the targets for all areas of environmental concern within the fixed time. However, the environmental policy proposals of GroenLinks have more impact than those mentioned in NEPP- 1 and NEPP- 2, both in 2000 and 2010. The environmental policy proposals of GroenLinks will lead to a substantial reduction of the emissions of CO 2 to probably below the 2000 target level. In addition, the emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> (particularly NOx and SO 2) will be strongly reduced even in comparison to NEPP- 2 proposals.

The same vaginal environment playg a fundamental role to guarantee tho survival of resident microorganisms. Several factors, like changes of temperature and oxygenation, can interfere on vaginal ecosystem, but the residQnt vaginal microorganisms are the main factors to stabilize the vaginal ecosystem. The Doderlein's lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal microorganism. It is capable of fermenting the glycogen deriving from {{the decline of the}} eutrophic vaginal mmucosa, to lactic acid with release of hydrogen ions. The final result of that metabolism is an acid pH with values between 4 - 4. 5. Vaginal pH undergoes physiologically changes from birth to menopause, according to changes of ovarian steroids occurring during woman's life. Adequate levels of estrogens play a fundamental role in the trophism of vaginal mucosa. In fact, estrogens increase the cellular content of glycogen. Exogenous acbvities on vaginal pH can be exerted by several factors,such as sexual activily, oral contraceptives, systemic diseases, vaginal infections (candidosis, thrichomonias, vaginosis), systemic or local therapies. They incrcase vaginal pH by acting through different mechanisms. The increase of vaginal pH is detrimental for the survival of Doderlein's lactobacillus, but not for the pathogenetic microorganisms whose replication, on the contrary, is favored by the absence of countraction exerted by Doderlein's bacillus.

There are several sets of generic values, which are based on different valuation methods, e. g. willingness-to-pay, abatement costs, taxes or non-monetary assessments. This study attempts to derive a consistent set of damage-based values based on estimation of willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid damages. Where possible we compile existing damage cost estimates from different sources. Currently, there are no generic damage costs available for eutrophication and acidification. We derive damage values for eutrophying and <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> using WTP estimates from available valuation studies. For eutrophication, we derive benefit transfer functions for eutrophication that allows calculation of site-specific values. We compare the derived ecosystem damage values to existing estimates of the cost for reducing nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to water. The analysis indicates that many abatement measures for nitrogen have a positive net benefit while most measures to reduce phosphorus cost more than the benefit achieved when estimated on a general level and should, instead, be assessed on a case-specific level. Moreover, a comparison of the existing environmental taxes on nitrogen, nitrogen oxides and phosphorus in Sweden show that the current tax rates do not reflect the externalities from these pollutants. Subsequently, we construct a weighting set by combining the derived values with existing generic damage values for human toxicity, photochemical oxidants and global warming. The weighting set - labelled Ecovalue 09 - is applied to three case studies and the outcome is compared to the results using other weighting sets. QC 20140423 </p...|$|R

The higher deposition in the more exposed region has resulted in higher nitrogen mineralisation and nitrification rates. The objective was to identify nitrogen indicators, which we defined as species with a skewed distribution in relation to the net potential nitrogen mineralisation in the soil. Soil pH was introduced as a co-variable as it may relate to other factors limiting plant growth and survival in these ecosystems. We tested the distribution of the net potential mineralised ammonium (minNH(4) (+)), nitrate (minNO(3) (-)), total inorganic nitrogen (minNH(4) (+) +NO 3 -) and the ratio of nitrification (percentage of minNH(4) (+) +NO 3 - as nitrate; %minNO(3) (-)) in 77 herbs. The number of species that showed a skewed distribution differed for the nitrogen variables studied in the following order: %minNO(3) (-) > minNO(3) (-) > minNH(4) (+) much greater than minNH(4) (+) +NO 3 -. As many as 21 species in region 1 and 17 species in region 2 were selected as indicators for one or several of the nitrogen variables. A fern, five graminoids and seven forbs were found to be indicators of low %minNO(3) (-) and two ferns, two grasses and 13 forbs were found to be indicators of high %minNO(3) (-).

This report presents {{the findings of the}} evaluation of the programmes of the first five parties. The main conclusion of this electroral environmental outlook is that the proposed environmental policy proposals have more impact than those mentioned in NEPP- 1 and NEPP- 2. In the year 2000 most substantial results are seen for emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), the most important greenhouse gas. The environmental policy proposals of GroenLinks lead to a substantial CO 2 emissions reduction of the emissions of CO 2 to probably below the 2000 target level. The PvdA and D 66 proposals also result in an additional reduction of the CO 2 -emissions, but not as large as that realised by GroenLinks. CDA and VVD proposals have the same impact as NEPP- 2 measures. The proposed measures of PvdA and GroenLinks reduce emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> (particularly) NOx and SO 2) in comparison to both the NEPP- 2 proposals and the environmental policy proposals of the other parties. However, because of the high emissions from foreign sources and the emissions of NOx in the Netherlands, none of the political parties will achieve the acidification (deposition) target. In the year 2010 environmental measures of all parties (except VVD) have more impact than NEPP- 2. PvdA is the only political party able to achieve more environmental benefits for equal spending. The GroenLinks proposals result in the largest reduction of CO 2 -emissions. In comparison to the NEPP- 2, full implementation and enforcement of the election programmes of the different parties will lead to an additional reducton of emissions of acidifyingemissions. GroenLinks is most successful in reducing the emissions of SO 2, NOx en NH 3. Compared to all other parties the election programma of GroenLinks lead to the highest additional increase in costs of environmental policy: 10 percent in aid of the NEPP- 2.

40|$|Emission and {{precipitation}} of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> and metals {{has caused}} severe acidification and increased metal concentrations in lakes and streams in Sweden {{as well as}} many other countries during the last decades. To counteract the negative effects of acidification, liming has been used extensively in Sweden since the 1970 ’s, a treatment that has been called one of the largest man-maid manipulations of aquatic ecosystems ever. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the influence of acidification and liming on deposition of metals to lake sediments, and to look at the fate of metals in sediments during a possible reacidification process because of terminated liming. Studies of both surface sediments and dated sediment profiles sampled from limed lakes and non-limed reference lakes indicated that liming causes increased sedimentation of many metals. Increased deposition to the sediments was found for Al, Cd, Co, Ni, Fe, Mn and Zn, probably {{as a direct result of}} the increased pH. Liming was also found to increase the deposition of As and Cr, but that was probably due to the secondary effect of association to Fe and Mn complexes. No influence of lime treatment on the deposition of Hg, Pb and V to lake sediments could be demonstrated. The studies also indicated that acidification can decrease the deposition of Cd, Fe, Mn and possibly also Co and Zn to the sediments. The contribution from the used lime products to the metal load in sediments of lakes limed directly on the lake surface was also evaluated. The lime products were found to be an important source for Al, Cu and Ni and a relatively important source for Co, Cr, Hg and V, but did not seem to contribute much to the content of As, Cd, Pb or Zn in lake sediments. An experimental study of reacidification showed that (re) mobilisation of metals, e. g Al, Cd, Mn and Zn, from sediments may occur and that reacidification of formerly lime treated lakes may contribute to increased concentrations of these metals in the lake water. Cu, Fe and Pb are less affected by pH changes and the concentrations of these metals will probably not increase in lake water during reacidification. Altogether, the thesis shows that lime treatment causes increased deposition of many metals to the lake sediments, whereas reacidification may lead to remobilisation of some metals from the sediments with increased concentrations in the water phase as a result...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{acidification}} {{has become}} a source of serious concern {{in many parts of the}} world. In southern Sweden, the deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances,</b> such as nitrogen and sulphur compounds, has decreased the mean pH of forest soils by almost one unit since the 1950 s. Apart from H+ ions themselves being harmful to plant roots, the potential toxicity of aluminium (Al) is increased when pH drops below 5. The aim of this thesis was to examine whether increased acidity has caused genetic adaptation to acidic conditions within Elymus caninus, Poa nemoralis, Deschampsia cespitosa and D. flexuosa, four grass species with widely different pH distributions. I have also investigated whether the content of Al in field-collected shoots is related to the Al concentration of the local soil environment, and whether this relationship differs between species with different pH distributions. Finally, I have examined the relationship between the colonisation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and soil pH in these species. To test for genetic adaptation to acidic conditions, I sampled tussocks (genotypes) of each species from deciduous forests in two regions of southern Sweden, differing in their exposure to acidifying deposition. The tolerance of different genotypes was tested in solution experiments with different pH and Al concentrations. I found little evidence of genetic adaptation to acidic conditions at the regional, populational and micro-site (genotype) level. The association between the Al content in shoots and the Al concentration in the soil, was weak for most species, and showed no consistent relationship with the species? pH distribution in the field. D. flexuosa had the lowest shoot Al content, although this species was growing in soils with relatively high Al levels. D. flexuosa also had the lowest AM colonisation, while E. caninus, which was found on the least acidic soils, had the highest AM colonisation and relatively high shoot Al content. In conclusion, I found that genetic adaptation to acidic soils has not yet occurred in southern Sweden. It is possible that more time is required for acid-stress tolerance to evolve. Adaptation to acidic conditions was most pronounced at the species level: E. caninus, growing in the least acidic soils, was the most sensitive species in the tolerance tests, while D. flexuosa, growing in the most acidic soils, was the least sensitive species. The high tolerance of D. flexuosa may, at least partly, be explained by the existence of an Al exclusion mechanism. However, my results provide no support for a role of AM fungi in acid stress tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Acidification {{of forest}} soils in Sweden has {{negatively}} affected nutrient status and caused toxic effects on biota. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to investigate potential impacts of two drivers of acidification of forest soils in Sweden: (1) tree growth with subsequent harvest and (2) deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds. The magnitude of acidification by tree growth was calculated using estimates of stem wood, logging residue and stump harvesting from a national forestry impact assessment and data of cations and anions in different tree parts. Acidification by tree growth {{was defined as the}} net cation uptake. The magnitude of acidification by deposition was estimated based on deposition data from four catchments throughout Sweden. Acidification by deposition was defined as the negative value of the acid neutralizing capacity in deposition. The acidifying effect of tree harvesting decreases in the order Norway spruce>birch>Scots pine. Harvesting of logging residues causes more soil acidification than harvesting of stumps, {{despite the fact that the}} biomass of stumps is larger, due to the higher contents of base cations in needles and branches than in stem wood. Harvesting of Scots pine and birch causes soil acidification at a magnitude equal to recent deposition levels while harvesting of Norway spruce causes more acidification than what is caused by deposition. To study the acidifying effects on the soil of tree growth during a forest generation and deposition, data from the Swedish Forest Soil Inventory – a large-scale inventory throughout Sweden – from the O (n= 1990), B (n= 1902) and C (n= 1477) horizons were used. Four variables were chosen as indicators of soil acidity: pH-H₂O (pH), base saturation (BS), exchangeable calcium (Ca) and exchangeable aluminium (Al) from each horizon. The variables were analysed with respect to tree age and data of sulphur deposition, using linear and multiple regression. For tree age, a relative age concept was used to account for different tree growth rates in different parts of Sweden. Tree growth during a forest generation and deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> both affect acidity related variables in Swedish forest soils. Tree growth causes decreased pH, BS and Ca and increased Al in the O and to some extent the B horizon in the beginning of the trees’ life cycle.

Seis hastes florais por unidade {{experimental}} de gérberas ‘Essandre’, colhidas em produtor comercial, foram condicionadas em frascos de vidro com 1 L das seguintes soluções: T 1 - água destilada (tratamento testemunha); T 2 - 1, 0 % (v/v) Flower®; T 3 - 1, 5 % (v/v) Flower®; T 4 - 1, 0 % (v/v) Flower Plus®; T 5 - 1, 5 % (v/v) Flower Plus®; e T 6 - 1 tablete de Florissant 500 ©. Ao final de 7 dias, observou-se o conteúdo de carboidratos totais e, ao final do experimento: a longevidade; a massa fresca relativa; e a absorção de solução. Nas soluções de vaso, durante o período experimental, avaliou-se o pH. A contagem bacteriana, nas hastes florais, foi realizada com os tratamentos: T 1 - água destilada (tratamento testemunha); T 2 - 0, 75 % (v/v) Flower®; T 3 - 1, 5 % (v/v) Flower®. Os conservantes florais testados não aumentam a longevidade pós-colheita de hastes florais de gérbera de corte. O uso de conservante floral reduz o número de bactérias em hastes florais de gérbera de corteCut {{flowers are}} highly perishable products and its shelf-life should be prolonged {{to the maximum}} to ensure the fi delity of consumers. A measure to assist vase life lengthening might most likely derives from the addition of exogenous sources of biocides, carbohydrates and <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> compounds present in commercial floral preservatives. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effi cacy of floral preservatives on postharvest longevity, and reducing the number of bacteria in gerbera cut flowers. Six cv. ‘Essandre’ gerbera flower stalks as experimental unit were harvested at a commercial cut flower producer and placed in glass jars with 1 L of these solutions: T 1 - distilled water (control treatment); T 2 - 1, 0 % (v/v) Flower®; T 3 - 1, 5 % (v/v) Flower®; T 4 - 1, 0 % (v/v) Flower Plus®; T 5 - 1, 5 % (v/v) Flower Plus® and T 6 - one tablet Florissant 500 ©. The following variables were evaluated at the end of shelf life of the fl ower stalks: contents of storage substances, longevity, relative fresh weight and solution uptake. The pH of vase solutions was determined along the evaluation period. Bacterial counts were performed from solutions of the following treatments: T 1 - distilled water (control treatment); T 2 - 0, 75 % (v/v) Flower®; and T 3 - 1, 5 % (v/v) Flower®. The floral preservatives tested did not increase the postharvest longevity of gerbera cut flowers. The use of floral preservative reduces the number of bacteria in gerbera cut flower...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{literature}} on the role and fate of organic matter in the acidification process as well as gaps in our knowledge is given. The conclusions may be highlighted in the following hypotheses. 1) During the postglacial development of soils and vegetation in the catchments, organic acids play a causative role. 2) In the recent acidification process by mineral acid deposition, organic acids act as object rather than subject. This role may be summarized as: Overall: Increased deposition of mineral acids results in decreased levels of dissolved organic matter in surface waters. Detail 1 : Increased deposition of mineral acids results in decreased organic matter mobilization from soils and wetlands. Detail 2 : Increases in the concentrations of mineral acids in soils, sediments, and surface waters will result in decreased microbial breakdown of organic matter. Detail 3 : Increased concentration of mineral acids affect the dissociation of organic acids and alter the physical structu re of dissolved humic substances, leading to an immobilization. Detail 4 : Increased concentrations of mineral acids increase {{the rate at which}} dissolved organic matter is lost from surface waters to the sediments mainly through co-precipitation with hydrolyzing metals (e. g., Al, Fe) that are themselves mobilized from the soils by mineral acids. These hypotheses are by no means mutually exclusive, they overlap functionally and may reinforce one another. There exists evidence that <b>acidified</b> humic <b>substances</b> exhibit an elevated toxicity towards aquatic invertebrates.

40|$|The Baltic Sea {{is located}} between 53 °N to 66 °N and from 10 °E to 30 °E {{and is the}} second largest {{brackish}} water body in the world. It consists of several basins where the Baltic Proper is the major water mass. Around 85 million people live in the catchment area of the Baltic Sea, which subjects it {{to a range of}} environmental pressures, such as increased nutrient inputs from human activities (eutrophication), shipping, over-fishing, acid rain and trace metals released from anti-fouling paint. All these stressors, combined with low alkalinity, variable salinity and limited water exchange, makes the Baltic Sea a very sensitive area that may be less resilient to future stressors such as climate change or increased shipping activities. Microplankton communities consist of small heterotrophic bacteria, picoplankton, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and smaller grazers, such as ciliates and zooplankton. In the Baltic Proper, there is a succession of blooms, within the microplankton community, from diatoms and dinoflagellates in the early spring to cyanobacteria during summer and ending with a second diatom and dinoflagellate bloom in the autumn. The cyanobacteria of the Baltic Proper bloom every summer and are dominated by Aphanizomenon sp. and Nodularia spumigena. Dolichospermum spp. is present but is less abundant. The effects of climate change were tested on a natural microplankton community, as well as on isolated cyanobacteria species from the Baltic Sea. To simulate effects of climate change, the temperature was increased from 12 °C to 16 °C, salinity decreased from 6 - 7 to 3 - 4 and atmospheric pCO 2 -levels was increased from 380 ppm to 960 ppm. The biovolume of Aphanizomenon sp. and N. spumigena increased when temperature was increased by 4 °C. When salinity was decreased by three units, both the growth and photosynthetic activity of N. spumigena were reduced while Aphanizomenon sp. was unaffected, and the growth of Dolichospermum sp. was increased. Furthermore, present-day salinities were beneficial, in terms of increased biovolumes, of diatoms, dinoflagellates and ciliates, compared to reduced future salinity. Increased atmospheric pCO 2 had no effect on any of the species in the microplankton community. These results show that the future microplankton community may be positive, in terms of increased biovolume, for the cyanobacteria species Aphanizomenon sp. and Dolichospermum spp. An increase of cyanobacteria blooms may open up to the possibility to grow and/or harvest these species as a source of biofuel or fatty acids (FA). Dolichospermum sp. yielded higher total FA content per biovolume, compared to the other two cyanobacteria species in phosphorus-depleted medium and Aphanizomenon sp. in nitrogen-depleted medium. Natural nutrient levels in the Baltic Proper are low both in nitrogen and phosphorus, which indicates a possible future market for biofuel and FA technologies. Additionally, the effects of seawater scrubbing (SWS) were tested on a natural summer-bloom microplankton community. Three different concentrations of scrubber water were added; 1 %, 3 % and 10 %. To elucidate effects of decreased pH alone, water acidified with H 2 SO 4 was added in equal concentrations. The six treatments were compared to a control without <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances.</b> SWS or the corresponding pH treatments, did not have a direct effect on microplankton species composition and biovolume. However, the increased amount of Cu and Zn in the scrubber water, combined with significant decrease in pH and alkalinity already at the 1 % scrubber water treatment calls for precaution when implementing scrubber units on the shipping fleet of the Baltic Sea. The accumulated effects of long-term repeated addition constantly throughout the year, i. e. in a shipping lane, are yet to be elucidated...|$|R

As fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity are not included in these models, environmental life-cycle assessment of products (LCA) may produce incorrect results for these impact categories. This paper outlines the spatially explicit regional air pollution information and simulation model (RAINSLCA), which was developed for the calculation of acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potentials of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) air emissions and acidification potentials for sulfur dioxide (SO 2) air emissions for Europe and a number of European regions, taking fate, background depositions and effects into account.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{has been}} a major threat to human health, ecosystems, and agricultural crops ever since the onset of widespread use of fossil fuel combustion and emissions of harmful substances into ambient air. As a basis for the development, implementation, and compliance assessment of air pollution control policies, monitoring networks for priority air pollutants were established, primarily for regulatory purposes. With increasing understanding of emission sources and the release and environmental fate of chemicals and toxic substances into ambient air, as well as atmospheric transport and chemical conversion processes, increasingly complex air pollution models have entered the scene. Today, highly accurate equipment is available to measure trace gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. In addition, sophisticated atmospheric chemistry transport models—which are routinely compared to and validated and assessed against measurements—are used to model dispersion and chemical processes affecting the composition of the atmosphere, and the resulting ambient concentrations of harmful pollutants. The models also provide methods to quantify the deposition of pollutants, such as <b>acidifying</b> and eutrophying <b>substances,</b> in vegetation, soils, and freshwater ecosystems. This article provides a general overview of the underlying concepts and key features of monitoring and modeling systems for outdoor air pollution...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} of liquid biofuels can have positive effects. It can decrease dependence {{on fossil fuels}} and increase farmers’ incomes. Agricultural {{production of}} mixed perennial biofuel crops may increase pollinator and avian richness. Most types of agricultural crop-based liquid biofuel production, however, {{have a negative effect}} on natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Comparisons of fossil fuels and liquid biofuels regarding their life cycle emissions of pollutants which are (eco) toxic or contribute to oxidizing smog, acidification or nutrification give mixed results. Fossil fuels often do better than biofuels as to emissions of <b>acidifying</b> and nutrifying <b>substances,</b> but often worse regarding ecotoxicity. A rapid increase in biofuel production can increase malnutrition due to its upward effect on food prices. Liquid biofuel lifecycles are linked to greater water consumption than their fossil fuel counterparts. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of liquid agricultural biofuels are currently often larger than those of their fossil fuel counterparts, when effects of land use on carbon stocks are included. An exception in this respect is current Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. When soil quality is to be maintained, there seems to be little scope to convert lignocellulosic harvest residues into liquid biofuels. Agricultural biofuels are much poorer converters of solar energy into usable energy than photovoltaic cells...|$|R
40|$|Every {{two years}} the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) brings out an {{economic}} outlook for the medium term (MT scenarios), i. e. the next four years. For the 1997 MT publication the RIVM has quantified the corresponding environmental effects of these economic developments, or more specifically the effects for the environmental themes of global change, acidification, eutrophication and waste disposal. The methodological and quantitative underpinning of the environmental calculations are presented in this report, which {{can be considered as}} the environmental background document for the MT scenarios. The following main conclusions were drawn: (1) although economic growth will continue, emissions of <b>acidifying</b> and eutrophying <b>substances</b> will decrease in the coming years, while the production of waste will increase; due to more recycling, the total amount of waste to be incinerated, to be disposed of in landfills or to be discharged into the water will decrease; (2) the emissions of CO 2 will continue to grow with the economy, although at a slower pace, while policy aims at a reduction of 3 % in 2000 compared to 1990; (3) strong efforts will be necessary to realise the current policy objectives for the themes of acidification, eutrophication and CO 2; (4) for every extra percent of economic growth in the future, there will be roughly an increase in environmental pressure of 0. 5 % to 1 %...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{models are}} often {{used to assess the}} {{potential}} impact of <b>acidifying</b> and eutrophying <b>substances</b> released during the life cycle of products. As fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity are not included in these models, environmental life-cycle assessment of products (LCA) may produce incorrect results for these impact categories. This paper outlines the spatially explicit regional air pollution information and simulation model (RAINS-LCA), which was developed for the calculation of acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potentials of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) air emissions and acidification potentials for sulfur dioxide (SO 2) air emissions for Europe and a number of European regions, taking fate, background depositions and effects into account. Two impact definitions are explored in the calculations: 1) the marginal change in the hazard index of all ecosystems in Europe and 2) the marginal change in the hazard index of ecosystems in Europe where the critical load is actually exceeded. The inclusion of fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity results in a different ranking of substances compared to simpler model outcomes. In the context of acidification, emissions of nitrogen compounds are regarded as about a factor 2 less important relative to sulfur compounds. Furthermore, using RAINS-LCA as opposed to simpler models, it was found that region-specific differences in terrestrial eutrophication and acidification potentials range up to 1. 5 and 3. 5 orders of magnitude, respectively. By means of scenario analysis, it was also shown that "only above critical load" terrestrial eutrophication and acidification potentials for the years 1995 and 2010 differ up to 0. 6 order and 1 order of magnitude, respectively. These results imply {{that it is important to}} use region-specific and time-specific acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potentials, if it is expected that life-cycle emissions of acidifying and eutrophying air pollutants are predominantly situated in a few (European) regions and within a specific year. Further improvements in RAINS-LCA may be established by including source-receptor matrices of the Northern Hemisphere instead of Europe and using the probability of species occurrence as a basis for the effect assessment...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of trace gases {{originating}} from anthropogenic activities are vital input data for chemical transport models (CTMs). Other key input datasets such as meteorological drivers, and biogeochemical and physical processes {{have been subject}} to detailed investigation and research in the recent past, while the representation of spatio-temporal aspects of emission data in CTMs has been somewhat neglected. Arguably, this has less impact on the regional to hemispheric or global scale, where the grid sizes of currently applied CTMs represent well mixed average concentrations or deposition values. Evaluating model output against ground-based observations or remote sensing results on these spatial levels may not to be overly sensitive to the temporal (and spatial) profiles of emission input data. With increasing level of detail and spatio-temporal resolution, CTMs applied to determine national or local scale air quality are likely prone to be more sensitive to the spatial and temporal patterns of anthropogenic emissions. The location and timing of emission events - for instance peaks of ammonia emissions following the spring and autumn application of manure and mineral fertilisers - may well determine local concentration or deposition episodes, while not necessarily affecting seasonal or even annual mean values. In the case of agriculture, both anthropogenic activities (e. g. manure spreading and fertilizer application) and meteorological factors (e. g. temperature and seasonality) have been investigated regarding their influence on the spatiotemporal distribution of NH 3 emissions (see for instance [1], [2], [4], [5] and [6]). The discussion of results in this case will focus on the impact on the deposition of <b>acidifying</b> and eutrophying <b>substances,</b> as well as the contribution to the formation of ammonium nitrates and sulphates and hence ambient concentrations of secondary particulate matter. This paper discusses results of the application of the EMEP 4 UK CTM on a 5 km x 5 km resolution for the whole of the United Kingdom. To evaluate the effect of changing the temporal profiles, three different model setups, e. g. using rather coarse and potentially outdated temporal profiles of the EMEP unified model, with varying degrees of detail (in this case, a monthly profile (cf. [3]) vs. 3 hourly emission values[6]) are evaluated against the AGANET measurement network stations across the UK. The discussion of results will focus on (a) the effect of temporal emission profiles on modelled vs. measured concentration/deposition values, (b) the influence on deposition of reactive nitrogen on ecosystems near ammonia sources and (c) the magnitude of influence of anthropogenic activity vs. meteorology for the dispersion of ammonia from agriculture. The results presented in this paper will help to determine the appropriate degree of detail with regard to the temporal profiles of anthropogenic emission data, as collecting detailed statistical data on anthropogenic activities for high spatially resolved model applications can be very time consuming and expensive. In addition, the effect on improving the temporal representation of emissions influenced by both anthropogenic activities and meteorological parameters can contribute to reducing uncertainties in model results that are highly relevant for policy development, e. g. covering aspects of critical load exceedance in vulnerable ecosystems or the exceedance of concentrations of PM...|$|R
