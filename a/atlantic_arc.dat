50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{cross-border}} regions can be distinguished. First, they vary in geographic scope. Small-scale initiatives such as the EUREGIO can be distinguished from larger groupings, such as the 'Working Communities'. The latter - {{most of them were}} founded between 1975 and 1985 - usually comprise several regions forming large areas that can stretch over several nation states. Examples of Working Communities are the Arge Alp, the Alpes-Adria, the Working Community of the Western Alps (COTRAO), the Working Community of the Pyrenees or the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Arc.</b> Their organizational structures usually consist of a general assembly, an executive committee, thematic working groups and secretariats (Aykaç, 1994: 12-14), but activities tend to be confined to common declarations and information exchange.

This report covers progress from Phase II program inception through Amercom closure. ARC'S Phase II effort built upon the results of the Phase I Applications Assessment and Process Engineering developments to produce CFCC test components for end-user evaluation. Initially, the Phase 11 effort planned to develop and produce three CFCC components: CFCC compression rings for stationary diesel engines, CFCC hot gas fans for industrial furnace applications, and CFCC hot gas filters for current and advanced coal fired power cycles. As the program progressed, the development effort for the diesel engine piston rings was suspended. This decision was based on technical issues, cost factors and reduced program funding; the status of CFCC diesel engine piston ring development will be discussed in detail in section 2. 2. 1...|$|R
40|$|Solid rocket {{propellants}} have various applications, includ-ing weapons, satellites, and air bag technology. In these applications {{burn rate}} and pattern prediction are important parameters in predicting ballistic motor performances and motor design. While existing equations accurately predict burn rates for most solid engine propellants, these stan-dard equations do not adequately capture rates associated with certain engine formations, such as Solid Fuel Ram-jets (SFRJ) and some Solid Rocket Motors (SRM). The propellant burning rates in SFRJ and SRM are not homo-geneous due to several factors, {{such as the}} flowfield, edge effects, etc. To overcome this deficiency, <b>Atlantic</b> Re-search Corporation (<b>ARC)</b> is developing a novel ultra-sound technology to measure burn rate directly. Techni-cal challenges arise, however, when the echo of the propellant surface is weak and difficult to detect, because of limited ultrasonic power, the mismatch of case and propellant impedance, and associated electronic and mag-netic noises. Thus, the main objective of this project is to accurately recognize the echo of sound waves from time-series data corrupted by noise. In this paper, the design, testing, and implementation of an algorithm to extract burn rate profiles from ultrasound measurements is dis-cussed. Also described is {{the design of a}} prototype hu-man-computer interface that is used to record and display burn rate data...|$|R
40|$|Observations from {{numerous}} cold-water coral {{locations in the}} NE Atlantic show energetic near-bottom flow dynamics along the European continental margin at individual coral mounds and mound clusters. Dynamics are largely controlled by tide-topography interaction generating and enhancing periodic motions such as trapped waves, freely propagating internal tides and internal hydraulic jumps. In this study, linkages between key abiotic parameters and cold water coral occurrences are explored across entire cold-water coral mound provinces using an integrated modelling and observational approach. The 3 -D ocean circulation model ROMS-AGRIF was applied to simulate near-bottom hydrodynamic conditions at three provinces in the NE <b>Atlantic</b> (Logachev mounds, <b>Arc</b> mounds and Belgica mounds) adopting a nested model setup with a central grid resolution of 250 m. Simulations were carried out {{with a focus on}} accurate high-resolution topography and tidal forcing. The central model bathymetry was taken from high-resolution INSS (Irish National Seabed Survey) seafloor mapping data. The model was integrated over a full one-year reference period starting from the 1 st January 2010. Interannual variability was not considered. Tidal forcing was obtained from a global solution of the Oregon State University (OSU) inverse tidal model. Modelled fields of benthic currents were validated against available independent in situ observations. Coral assemblage patterns (presence and absence locations) were obtained from benthic surveys of the EU FP 7 CoralFISH programme and supplemented by data from additional field surveys. Modelled near-bottom currents, temperature and salinity were analysed for a 1 -month subset (15 th April to 15 th May 2010) corresponding to the main CoralFISH survey period. The model results show intensified near-bottom currents in areas where living corals are observed by contrast with coral absence and random background locations. Instantaneous and time-mean current speeds at mound clusters in the Logachev province exceeded typical values in non-coral areas by up to a factor of three. Currents at cold-water coral locations in the Arc and Belgica mound provinces were less energetic, but still elevated compared to non-coral locations. An analysis of dynamical processes associated with oscillatory flow interacting with topography suggests that these motions are locally important food supply mechanisms to cold-water corals by promoting large amplitude local vertical mixing and organic matter fluxes. It is shown that their presence varies considerably between provinces based on the interplay of topographic slope, flow magnitude and ambient stratification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Interdisciplinary studies {{comparing}} fisheries-dependent regions {{across the}} North Atlantic find {{a number of}} broad patterns. Large ecological shifts, disastrous to historical fisheries, have resulted when unfavorable climatic events occur atop overfishing.

Within {{the framework of the}} DEPURANAT project, co-financed by the European Interregional Cooperation Programme (Interreg IIIB <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Arc),</b> several Natural Reclamation Systems (NRS) based upon no-conventional technologies of wastewater treatment, have been studied from different points of view in rural areas: their effectiveness for producing regenerated wastewater of acceptable quality for several reuse options and vegetal biomass for different purposes, their environmental integration or their potential of implementation. Most of these treatment plants achieved high mean removal efficiencies: TSS (73 – 96 %); BOD 5 (74 – 94 %); COD (53 – 90 %); E. coli (2 – 3 log units); Enterococci (1. 5 – 4 log units). The environmental impact of the systems was determined using an adapted life cycle assessment methodology and the economic analysis of the systems was focused on analysing the financial indicators, empirical cost functions, and the potential market for these technologies. Furthermore, maps of potential implementation of these systems and a support tool for deciding upon the installation of conventional or NRS were designed with the aim of promoting them.

40|$|Availability {{and easy}} access {{to a wide range}} of natural and human-activity data on the oceans and coastal regions of Europe is the basis for {{strategic}} decision-making on coastal and marine policy. Strategies within Europe's Integrated Maritime Policy, including the Maritime Strategy for the Atlantic Area, Blue Growth, Maritime Spatial Planning and Marine Data and Knowledge, require coherent and comparable socio-economic data across European countries. Similarly, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires member states to carry out economic and social analysis of their waters and the reformed Common Fisheries Policy includes a social dimension requiring socio-economic data. However, the availability of consistent, accessible marine socio-economic data for the European <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Arc</b> regions is limited. Ocean economy studies have been undertaken in some countries (for example, Ireland, France, and UK) but timescales and methodologies are not necessarily comparable.

40|$|The DEPURANATt project {{received}} co-financing {{from the}} European Union through its interregional cooperation programme, Interreg IIIB <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Arc</b> Programme. This project, coordinated by the Canary Islands Institute of Technology, allowed French, Portuguese and Spanish institutions {{to work together}} on sustainable management of wastewater in rural and protected areas. Within the framework of this project, twelve natural wastewater treatment systems have been built or adapted from pre-existing systems in Portugal, Andalusia and the Canary islands. In these systems, a shared ambitious protocol of physical-chemical and microbiological analyses was established, and several studies carried out with respect to the agronomical quality of the effluents and the physiology of the plants. These analytical campaigns also attempted to promote a positive image of these systems to, and in, the rural areas. Moreover, {{it is important for the}} target publics to value correctly the possibilities created by regenerated wastewater and vegetal biomass, and thus accept the same as integral methods which contribute to sustainable local development. Several studies relating to social integration were focused, to this end, on measuring people’s acceptance of these systems in their areas, whereas the environmental impact of the systems was determined using an adapted life cycle assessment methodology. The economic analysis of the systems focused on analysing the financial indicators, empirical cost functions, and the potential market for these technologies. Furthermore, maps of potential areas where natural wastewater treatment systems may be implemented have been created. Finally, a support tool for deciding upon the installation of conventional or natural wastewater treatment systems has been designed with the aim of informing at technicians about the most suitable technology to be applied in each situation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was the {{assessment}} of economic and environmental aspects of decentralised energy-saving wastewater treatment systems. The formulated investment and operation cost functions were adjusted by a power law function. The different wastewater systems serving population settlements between 50 p. e. and 250 p. e., presented associated investment costs varying from 400 €/p. e. to 200 €/p. e. and annual operation costs {{in the range of}} 70 €/p. e. to 20 €/p. e., respectively. A Life Cycle Analysis approach was used to compare the environmental impact alternative wastewater systems. The assessment was focused on two energy-saving systems (constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration) and a conventional one (activated sludge process). The low environmental impact of the energy-saving wastewater treatment systems was demonstrated, being the most relevant the global warming indicator. Options for reduction of life cycle impacts were assessed including materials used in construction and operation lifetime of the systems. A 10 % extension of operation lifetime of constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration systems lead to a 5 % and 7 % decrease in the abiotic depletion indicator, respectively, and to a 1 % decrease in CO 2 emissions in both systems. Replacing steel with HDPE in the activated sludge tank resulted in a 1 % reduction in CO 2 emission and 1 % in the abiotic depletion indicator. In the case of the Imhoff tank a 1 % reduction in CO 2 emissions and 5 % in abiotic depletion indicator were observed when concrete was replaced by HDPE. Therefore, considering the huge potential of energy saving wastewater treatment systems, the overall environmental impact of such design alternatives should not be discarded.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the ocean energy sector, identifying the necessary steps that are required in order to facilitate the development and deployment of ocean energy technologies towards the formation of a viable and successful industry. Europe, in particular the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Arc</b> region, has a vast wave and tidal energy resource, which could supply a significant part of the European electricity demand and play an important role in the future European energy mix. The sector is still in a nascent state, with the most advanced prototypes currently undergoing long-term testing to prove reliability, operability and durability of the devices. At the current stage of development, effort is needed to secure the correct technology solutions and the underpinning policies that will allow growth of the ocean energy sector, facilitating competitive and sustainable development. The sector has seen the announcement of numerous ambitious targets; however, the current deployed capacity is small. The step from pre-commercial device demonstration to array demonstration requires significant investment, and sustained long term support mechanisms will be required in order to allow the first array projects to take off. Sustained engagement with industry, in both stakeholder interviews and a supply chain focussed workshop, has allowed for a diverse range of inputs into what is a challenging and demanding topic within the ocean energy sector: Providing recommendations for overcoming the barriers facing the wave and tidal energy sector. Facilitating development and deployment of nascent ocean energy technology to allow commercialisation of technology, and formation of a viable and successful industry, is critical for a successful future for this emerging renewable energy technology. A list of actions required for the implementation of the sector has been identified and prioritised through collaboration with the broader wave and tidal energy sectors. These actions are fundamental in achieving performance improvement and cost reduction targets for the sectors. The implementation of recommended actions through joint research and industrial activities, addressing the themes presented in this document, plays an important role in achieving the critical mass and effectiveness required to ensure technologies are ready for deployment across Europe. By working together, the ocean energy stakeholders within both industry and the supply-chain can demonstrate that the sector is capable of large-scale technology production, addressing the three-fold challenge of energy security, CO 2 emission reduction, and inward investment within the EU. It is only through achievement of these challenges that the sector can gain traction and accelerate towards 2030 and 2050 ocean energy deployment and commercialisation targets and become a substantial part of the future European energy mix. This paper presents recommendations which could represent a key opportunity to reinforce Europe’s leadership in RD&D as the ocean energy sector progresses from concept to market penetration and will provide direct input into the development of a Market Deployment Strategy for the sector.
