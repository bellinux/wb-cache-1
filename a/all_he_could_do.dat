25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore {{made a terrible}} error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had {{little more than a year}} to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in 1864, Sherman ordered the city's evacuation. When the city council appealed to him to rescind that order, {{on the grounds that}} it would cause great {{hardship}} to women, children, the elderly, and others who bore no responsibility for the conduct of the war, Sherman sent a written response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if the Union were restored, and that he was therefore prepared to do <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to quash the rebellion: ...|$|E
500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if someone does not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E
60|$|He {{started by}} sneering {{at the little}} game that Squire Brown 'ad left, but <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> didn't seem to make much difference; things {{disappeared}} in a most eggstrordinary way, and the keepers went pretty near crazy, while the things the squire said about Claybury and Claybury men was disgraceful.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Weatherley paused. Mr. Jarvis did {{his best}} to grasp the situation, but failed. <b>All</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to {{maintain}} his attitude of intelligent interest.|$|R
60|$|Charlie {{sat there}} arguing all the evening, {{but it was}} no good, and the idea o' them people sitting there and refusing to let 'im have his own money pretty near sent 'im crazy. It was <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to kiss Emma good-night, and 'e couldn't have 'elped {{slamming}} the front door if he'd been paid for it. The only comfort he 'ad got left was the Sydney gal's photygraph, and he took that out and looked at it under nearly every lamp-post he passed.|$|R
2500|$|The same year, Raffles {{appointed}} John Crawfurd as Resident of Singapore. Crawfurd {{doubted the}} legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a Court of Requests overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident's Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on [...] "general principles of English law", taking into account so far as he could the [...] "character and manners of the different classes" [...] of local inhabitants. Unfortunately, Crawfurd's courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to banish them from the island.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mok-qua Bennette was {{his real}} name. On {{the way to}} Beaver Bay in 1870 he spied a bear (named Mok-qua) sunning itself under a large spruce. Because of weather {{conditions}} - three feet of snow - {{it was impossible for}} the bear to move fast. The bear looked like good meat to the Indian who, unfortunately, didn't have a gun with him. He took a ten foot stick and attached a butcher knife to it thinking he would stab the bear to death. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was tickle the bear. Seeing his method didn't work he cut a piece from a birch sapling with his tomahawk and tried to kill the bear by clubbing him to death. After the first blow he fell back while drawing away and got tangled in the limbs of the fallen tree. Mok-qua attacked the Indian, clawing his shoulder and arms. He did not bite him. The bear left the Indian who was unconscious. The Indian regained consciousness at night and when he did he was very sick and almost frozen. He somehow dragged himself to the farm of Jacob Hangarner who, after warming and feeding him, brough him to Beaver Bay. The Indian suffered more from exposure than from the attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hook {{tries to}} comfort Emma by {{telling her that}} when his brother died <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was live in the moment. But Emma wonders how she can be still alive if Snow died. All of a sudden, a ladybug buzzes around Hook and just as {{he is about to}} kill the insect, Charming shouts “wait!” Charming takes the ladybug, places it on his hand and it is {{transformed}} back into Snow White by the Blue Fairy, thanks to a special form of fairy dust. The Blue Fairy is also aware that Emma wasn't Leia all along, but says it’s all right, her secrets can be hers. Snow is startled when Emma hugs her with tears in her eyes, shouting, “You’re alive.” Snow and Charming seem to be warming up to each other, causing a slight restoration in the timeline. Emma looks at the prisoner and suggests that she and Hook take her with them back to Storybrooke, but the woman is not happy about that idea, prompting Emma to knock her out to kidnap her. As Emma, Hook, and their additional guest go their separate ways, both Snow and Charming reach the troll bridge, but thanks to the altered timeline Snow doesn’t have her dust as a weapon to defeat the trolls, so she goes towards them and bluffs. They drop their weapons and take off. The timeline is back on track as Charming is now smitten with Snow before they go their separate ways, with Snow holding on to the ring and trying it on. [...] Emma watches from a distance and gets weepy. Hook says, “It’s ok, Swan. Not everyone gets a chance to watch their parents fall in love.” Emma opens the book, and discovers a picture of Snow and Charming getting married, and as expected Regina still seeking vengeance on Snow, resulting in the timeline being restored, only this time Regina turns the trolls into bugs with the dark magic and squashes them.|$|E
60|$|Nevis {{glanced at}} him savagely and then strode away, which was, indeed, <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> An altercation would serve no useful purpose, and his {{antagonist}} was notoriously quick at repartee.|$|R
60|$|Our curate {{said very}} well then: he had warned him, {{and that was}} <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> If <b>he</b> (Mr. Coombes) was {{determined}} to {{make a fool of}} himself, he (Mr. Coombes) must do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "George Kettle {{opened the}} door wot led into the kitchen, and then ’e sprang back with such a shout that {{the man with the}} scythe tried to escape, taking Henery Walker along with ’im. George Kettle tried to speak, but couldn’t. <b>All</b> <b>’e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to point with ’is finger at Bob Pretty’s kitchen—and Bob Pretty’s kitchen was {{for all the world like}} a pork-butcher’s shop. There was joints o’ pork ’anging from the ceiling, two brine tubs as full as they could be, and quite a string of fowls and ducks all ready for market.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, Dick has {{the only}} map we possess." [...] And Tom grinned, while Sam had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep from}} {{laughing}} outright.|$|E
6000|$|He {{rolled his}} eyes round heavily, {{but he was too}} far gone to express surprise. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to utter one word, [...] "Brandy." ...|$|E

60|$|Ginger {{tried to}} explain, {{but it was}} all no good, and two minutes arterwards 'e was walking back to 'is lodgings like a dog with its tail between its legs. His 'ead was going round and round with astonishment, and 'e was in such a temper that 'e barged into a man twice as big as himself and then offered to knock his 'ead off when 'e objected. And when Sam and Peter asked him 'ow he 'ad got on, he was in such a state of mind it was <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to answer 'em.|$|R
50|$|Arulappa recollects that on 12 December 1971, he {{received}} a letter from the Apostolic Nunciature stating that he had been nominated as the Archbishop of Hyderabad and <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was just kneel down and pray like never before.|$|R
6000|$|... ''Old 'ard, old gal!' says master, and 'Gently then!' says I, But {{an engine}} won't 'eed coaxin' an' it ain't {{no use to}} try; So first 'e pulled a lever, an' then 'e turned a screw, But the thing kept crawlin' forrard spite of <b>all</b> that <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|Poor Sam {{could not}} speak, for a wave had struck him {{full in the}} mouth, and he had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep from being}} washed overboard.|$|E
60|$|After {{thinking}} over {{it alone}} there in Feemy's sitting-room for an hour, he determined that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{was to go}} back again to his only friend, Father John.|$|E
60|$|Nellie {{burst into}} tears, and Sam and Grace {{did their best}} to comfort her. Grace's own eyes were moist, and Sam had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from {{breaking}} down likewise.|$|E
60|$|Leaping, as he thought, to {{the exact}} centre of the tunnel, he held his sword point ready on a line with the beast's chest. It was <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> hoping that chance might send the point into the savage heart as he went down beneath the great body.|$|R
50|$|Blakiston was {{strongly}} against Oxford degrees being awarded to women, which began while {{he served as}} university Vice-Chancellor {{and in spite of}} <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to <b>do</b> oppose it. However he was also devoted to the college and its students and had the lifelong habit of collecting clippings from The Times that mentioned any former student.|$|R
60|$|Brand {{turned to}} him in surprise; but he saw that Mowbray {{was not to be}} moved, and he {{understood}} what had prompted the Colonel's sudden change. Brand had not played a straight game, and he had lost. At the last moment the prairie man had beaten him. <b>All</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> now was to bear his defeat with dignity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] he demanded, in {{a muffled}} tone, for {{inside of the}} bag it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to breathe. The {{covering}} was so heavy {{he could not see}} a thing.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Rightbody {{looked at}} this flesh of his flesh, pretty and palpable flesh as it was; but, being confronted as equally with the brain of his brain, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to say meekly,-- ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> saw it <b>all</b> well enough--he the {{man with}} the far-seeing mind and the eagle-eyes that missed nothing--neither a look of indecision, nor an {{indication}} of revolt. <b>He</b> saw it <b>all</b> but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing, for <b>he</b> too felt overwhelmed by that wave of indecision and of discouragement. Faith in himself, energy in action, had gone. He envisaged the possibility of a vanquished and dismembered France.|$|R
5000|$|... "He taught {{class in}} a suit with the stiff color, the vest, and spats and street shoes. With <b>all</b> this, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>do</b> a double tour en l'air and land in a perfect fifth." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{made him}} frown, and his face, always harsh, and only {{redeemed}} from ugliness {{by the fire}} of his eyes, became almost frightful, so {{that it might have}} terrified a weak person into yielding; but of course <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> then <b>do</b> was to make a sign to M. de Lamont to approach, present him to me, and say, 'I have requested Madame to reconsider her decision,' with which he bowed and left us tete-a-tete in the throng.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who saw {{anything}} of Lambert Brown?" [...] said another; [...] "I left him bogged below there at Gurtnascreenagh, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> the old grey horse wouldn't move a leg {{to get out}} for him." ...|$|E
60|$|The sailor {{was pulling}} up the stream, {{close to the}} shore, and the {{brothers}} could watch him with ease. The tide was running out and the oarsman had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to make any headway.|$|E
60|$|The boat {{continued}} to toss and pitch, and now Dave had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep his}} feet. When he reached {{the entrance to the}} main deck he was stopped by one of the under officers.|$|E
60|$|It is the perception--perhaps unconscious--of this inexplicable {{phenomenon}} {{that causes the}} still unharmed, still vigorous and still courageous soldier to retire without having come into actual contact with his foe. He sees, or feels, that he cannot. His bayonet is a useless weapon for slaughter; its purpose is a moral one. Its mandate exhausted, he sheathes it and trusts to the bullet. That failing, he retreats. <b>He</b> has <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with such appliances as he has.|$|R
60|$|He was an {{universal}} favourite, and his ingenuity {{in little}} things was transcendent. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> cut oranges into such devices as {{none of us}} had an idea of. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> make a boat out of anything, from a skewer upwards. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> turn cramp-bones into chessmen; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels, and bird-cages of old wire. But he was greatest of all, perhaps, in the articles of string and straw; with which we were <b>all</b> persuaded <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything that <b>could</b> be <b>done</b> by hands.|$|R
60|$|The King of England also, Edward's father, made {{arrangements}} for sending {{to his son}} a large sum of money. This was of great assistance to him, but still he had not money enough. So he broke up his plate, both gold and silver, and caused it to be coined, in order to assist in filling his treasury. Still, notwithstanding <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>he</b> {{found it difficult to}} provide sufficient funds for the purchase of the provisions that he required, and for the pay of the men.|$|R
