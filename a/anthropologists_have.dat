5|$|In {{addition}} to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist {{in the investigation of}} war crimes and mass fatality investigations. <b>Anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible. <b>Anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide. Organizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic Anthropology, and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Many Egyptologists and <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} {{theories about}} how the gods developed in these early times. Gustave Jéquier, for instance, thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes, then deities in animal form, and finally deities in human form, whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning. Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic, and more current ones, such as Siegfried Morenz' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment, are difficult to prove.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> {{dominated}} {{the study of}} Navajo textiles. Most historic examples of these works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed {{with an eye toward}} normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence. These priorities have artificially inflated the market value for items of inferior craftsmanship. In general, this tendency has affected most non-European art to some degree.|$|E

5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. <b>Anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended {{over a period of time}} to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce de León is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de León met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de León found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de León was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de León was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. In the more than 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} Mead's conclusions rested on the validity of a single interview with a single person, finding instead that Mead based her conclusions on the sum of her observations and interviews during her time in Samoa, and that {{the status of the}} single interview did not falsify her work. Some <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> however maintained that even though Freeman's critique was invalid, Mead's study was not sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support the conclusions she drew.|$|E

25|$|Stone tools, {{particularly}} projectile {{points and}} scrapers, {{are the primary}} evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Archaeologists and <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> studied differences among these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods. The Clovis culture, the earliest definitively-dated Paleo-Indians in the Americas, appears around 11,500 RCBP (radiocarbon years Before Present), equivalent to 13,500 to 13,000 calendar years ago.|$|E
25|$|The rise of Christianity saw {{an end to}} cremation, being {{influenced}} by its roots in Judaism, {{the belief in the}} resurrection of the body, and following the example of Christ's burial. <b>Anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> been able to track the advance of Christianity throughout Europe with the appearance of cemeteries. By the 5th century, with the spread of Christianity, the practice of burning bodies gradually disappeared from Europe.|$|E

50|$|There is an {{ambiguity}} in Kluckhohn's formulation that would haunt anthropologists {{in the years}} to come. It makes it clear that one's moral standards make sense in terms of one's culture.

25|$|There is {{significant}} evidence {{of contact with}} Makassan fishers in the rock art and bark painting of northern Australia, with the perahu featuring prominently in many locations. Studies by <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> also found traditions that indicate Makassans negotiated {{for the right to}} fish certain waters. The exchange involved the trade of cloth, tobacco, metal axes and knives, rice and gin. The Yolgnu of Arnhem land also traded turtle-shell, pearls and cypress pine, and some were employed as trepangers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> {{not reached}} a {{conclusion}} {{as to whether}} kissing is learned or a behavior from instinct. It {{may be related to}} grooming behavior also seen between other animals, or arising as a result of mothers premasticating food for their children. Non-human primates also exhibit kissing behavior. Dogs, cats, birds and other animals display licking, nuzzling, and grooming behavior among themselves, and also towards humans or other species. This is sometimes interpreted by observers as a type of kissing.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the early}} prehistoric Vietnamese and Malaysians both resembled the Australo-Melanesian samples the most, the Màn Bạc {{people had a}} greater {{resemblance}} to the Đông Sơn samples {{dating back to the}} Iron Age. Analyzing cranial and dental remains, Matsumura concluded based on chronological differences that the Man Bac people were immigrants affiliated with peoples near the Yangtze River region in Southern China. Molecular <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> used classical genetic markers and mtDNA to analyze the similarities between early Chinese and Southeast Asians. Such genetic markers suggest the genetic layout of Southern Chinese peoples is quite similar to that of Southeast Asians.|$|E
25|$|As time progressed, the Seminole and Blacks {{had limited}} intermarriage; but historians and <b>anthropologists</b> <b>have</b> {{come to believe}} that {{generally}} the Black Seminoles had independent communities. They allied with the Seminole at times of war. The Seminole society was based on a matrilineal kinship system, in which inheritance and descent went through the maternal line. Children were considered to belong to the mother's clan, so those born to ethnic African mothers would have been considered black by the Seminole. While the children might integrate customs from both parents' cultures, the Seminole believed they belonged to the mother's group more than the father's.|$|E
