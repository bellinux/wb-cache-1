40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{that allows the}} isolation of eight different phenylazo derivatives of bile bilirubin. In step I of the isolation procedure, three bilirubin fractions (bilirubin fractions 1, 2 and 3) from human hepatic bile are separated by reverse-phase partition chromatography on silicone-treated Celite {{with the use of}} a solvent system prepared from butan- 1 -ol and 5 mm-phosphate buffer, pH 6. 0. Azo coupling is then performed with diazotized aniline. The three <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> mixtures are subjected to step II, in which the above chromatography system is used again. With each <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> mixture this step brings about the separation of a non-polar and a polar <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> fraction (azo 1 A and azo 1 B, azo 2 A and azo 2 B, and azo 3 A and azo 3 B from bilirubin fractions 1, 2 and 3 respectively). Approximately equal amounts of non-polar and polar pigments are obtained from bilirubin fractions 1 and 2, whereas bilirubin fraction 3 yields azo 3 B almost exclusively. In step IIIA the non-polar <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> fractions are fractionated further by adsorption chromatography on anhydrous sodium sulphate with the use of chloroform followed by a gradient of ethyl acetate in chloroform. Three azo pigments are thus obtained from both azo 2 A (azo 2 A 1, azo 2 A 2 and azo 2 A 3) and azo 3 A (azo 3 A 1, azo 3 A 2 and azo 3 A 3). The 2 A pigments occur in approximately the following proportions: azo 2 A 1, 90 %; azo 2 A 2, 10 %; azo 2 A 3, traces. The pigments are purified by crystallization, except for the A 3 pigments, which are probably degradation products arising from the corresponding A 2 pigments. In step IIIB the polar <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> fractions are subjected to reverse-phase partition chromatography on silicone-treated Celite {{with the use of a}} solvent system prepared from octan- 1 -ol–di-isopropyl ether–ethyl acetate–methanol– 0. 2 m-acetic acid (1 : 2 : 2 : 3 : 4, by vol.). <b>Azo</b> <b>pigment</b> fractions 2 B and 3 B each yield six azo pigments (azo 2 B 1 to azo 2 B 6 and azo 3 B 1 to azo 3 B 6 respectively) together with small amounts of products of hydrolysis (azo 2 AB and azo 3 AB). Only one azo B pigment is obtained from bilirubin fraction 1, and this <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> is probably of the B 2 type. The yields of the azo 3 B pigments suggest that these pigments are present in approximately the following proportions: azo 3 B 1, 0 – 0. 4 %; azo 3 B 2, traces; azo 3 B 3, traces; azo 3 B 4, 10 %; azo 3 B 5, 50 %; azo 3 B 6, 40 %. Azo pigments 2 B 1 to 2 B 6 are estimated to occur in similar proportions. Since pairs of correspondingly numbered azo pigments from bilirubin fractions 1, 2 and 3 do not separate on rechromatography together (e. g. azo 2 A 1 co-chromatographs with azo 3 A 1, and azo 2 B 6 co-chromatographs with azo 3 B 6), it is concluded that such pigments are chemically identical.

40|$|Neutral solvent {{systems were}} {{developed}} to isolate the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta isomers of biliverdin IX dimethyl ester by TLC. The individual free acids of biliverdin IX were obtained by saponification of the corresponding dimethyl esters.

Starting from a pure biliverdin IX dimethyl ester, the corresponding free acid of biliverdin IX or bilirubin IX was available within 3 - 4 h. Preparation of spectrally pure bile pigment required final TLC on acid-cleaned neutral TLC plates. The absorption spectra of the free acids and dimethyl esters of biliverdin IX in methanol showed a broad band at about 650 nm and a sharp band at about 375 nm.

A 10 -fold molar excess of HCl caused a 35 - to 50 -nm shift of the absorption maximum to longer wavelengths and near doubling of the maximum absorption. The molar absorption coefficients of biliverdins were identical for each free acid and dimethyl ester pair. In each case, Beer's law was followed in both methanol and acidified methanol.

40|$|SYNOPSIS A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of both direct and indirect serum bilirubin on the AutoAnalyzer is described which {{has a number of}} advantages over the automated method that is currently recommended. It gives total bilirubin results which are similar to those obtained with the equivalent manual method and direct bilirubin results which are usually about 10 % lower. The effect of haemolysis on estimations was investigated. It has little influence on the total, but significantly lowers the direct bilirubin results. Simple methods for the preparation of true bilirubin standards and a stable control serum are described. In a very careful study Nosslin (1960) showed that the method of Jendrassik and Grof (1938) for the estimation of total serum bilirubin had many advan-tages over other methods and that a modification of it gave a direct reaction which was the best available index of conjugated bilirubin in the serum. In the total bilirubin method the serum was mixed with a buffered caffeine solution which acted as an accelerator and then with diazo reagent. The <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> formed was converted from red to blue by the addition of alkali. In the direct reaction the accelerator solution was replaced by water and the diazo reaction terminated by ascorbic acid before treatment with alkali. Serum blanks were prepared with diazo I instead of mixed diazo reagent. The methods currently recommended for the determina-tion of bilirubin on the Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Gambino and Schreiber, 1964) are based on these procedures. Michaelsson (1961) demonstrated a number of disadvantages in Nosslin's method. First, caffeine was found to reduce the optical density of alkaline azobilirubin solutions. Since it was used in the total bilirubin, but not direct bilirubin estimations, and since the amount of direct-reacting bilirubin was calculated from data obtained by putting standards through the total bilirubin procedure this could cause misleading results. Secondly, ascorbic acid and diazo reagent react to form a coloured product in the direct reaction. They were not present in the blank...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} biochemically {{synthetic}} bilirubin sulfate was examined on detail, and bilirubin sulfate and bilirubin glucuronide were measured in bile of heterozygote Gunn rat and Wister strain rat. Further, after the intrvenous injection of (3) H-bilirubin sulfate into heterozygote Gunn rats and Wister strain rats, the biliary excretion rate of bilirubin sulfate was studied in them. The following results were gained by these studies. 1) The absorption peak was 452 nm in the synthetic bilirubin sulfate solution, pH 2. 2, and its <b>azo</b> <b>pigment</b> showed each peak absorptions at 535 - 545 nm in pH 2. 0 and at 565 - 575 nm in pH 1. 0.

D [...] These data suggest that this compound is bilirubin disulfate. 2) In the bile of Gunn rats and Wister strain rats, the molar ratio of glucuronic acid to esterfrom bilirubin was inversely proportional to that of sulfate radical to direct bilirubin (r=- 0. 74, p< 0. 05). This implies that the conjugation of bilirubin with sulfate increases compensatedly as compared to the disturbance of that of bilirubin with glucuronic acid. 3) The excretion ratios of 2 hours to 24 hours in the intravenous (3) H-bilirubin sulfate loading were 54. 2 % in Gunn rats and 63. 4 % in Wister strain rats. This finding supports the concept that bilirubin sulfate is easily excreted in the bile. The biliary excretion within 24 hours following the administration of bilirubin sulfate was 40. 4 % in Gunn rats and 69. 4 % in Wister strain rats, and these excretion rates decreased in parallel with the decrease of molar ratio in bilirubin glucuronide (r= 0. 96, p< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{number of}} tattooed {{individuals}} increased significantly, especially among youth. In the United States, up to 24 % {{of the population}} has tattoos, whereas in European countries like Germany about 9 % and the United Kingdom about 12 % are tattooed. Today frequently azo pigments are used for tattooing. These azo pigments are manufactured primarily for other purposes like printing, painting cars and coloring various consumer products. To estimate the risk of any health problems of tattooing, the colorant concentration in the skin and the human body after tattooing of the colorants must be determined. This has not been performed so far and was now firstly investigated by our research group. Therefore, an extraction method was established to determine the concentration of tattoo pigments and decomposition products quantitatively. The extraction of two widely used azo compounds, Pigment Red 22 (PR 22) and Rigment Red 9 (PR 9) and their laser induced decomposition were accomplished using recovery experiments and HPLC-DAD technology. For the pigments a nearly complete recovery was achieved from lysed skin (> 94 %). The decomposition products were extracted from skin showing a recovery of up to 100 %, except for one very volatile decomposition product. Based on this extraction procedure we could determine the amount of tattoo pigment punctured into skin. We tattooed excised pigskin and human skin with Pigment Red 22 under various conditions (concentration of the suspension, needle size and needle shape). After tattooing, we quantitatively extracted the pigment {{in order to determine the}} pigment concentration in skin (mean value 2. 53 mg/cm²). Since PR 22 is cleaved by laser light into toxic or even carcinogenic compounds we investigated the influence of UVB radiation and natural sun light on PR 22. PR 22 was dissolved in different solvents. The solutions were irradiated with either UVB-radiation or with natural sunlight. An evident cleavage of the pigment was detected in all solvents, when exposed to UVB radiation or natural sunlight. To investigate transportation of tattoo pigments inside the body after tattooing, we established an animal model using SKH- 1 hairless mice. The mice received tattoos with PR 22 on their back. The extraction of pigments immediately after tattooing yielded the concentration of PR 22 of 1. 76 mg/cm 2 that is placed in the body. In contrast to that, the extraction of PR 22 from skin 42 days after tattooing elucidates the extent of pigment transportation in the mice. Only 72 % of PR 22 remain inside the dermis. To investigate the decomposition of pigments by solar light, tattooed living mice were exposed to solar light for 31 days. We found that up to 60 % of the pigment is cleaved. Ex vivo laser treatment of tattooed mouse skin showed that up to 50 % of PR 22 located inside the mouse skin can be cleaved by laser light. For the first time we could quantitatively analyze real existing tattoos in human skin tissue. The extraction of a tattoo revealed PR 22 and PR 170 to be the red tattoo pigments used by the artist. Several years after tattooing the concentration of PR 22 inside the skin is 0. 11 mg/cm 2. The last chapter deals with an interesting additional problem of azo dyes.

An intramolecular N—H O hydrogen bond in each molecule helps to establish their near planar conformation. In the crystal, molecules are linked through O—H O hydrogen bonds into infinite chains running along the a-axis direction. In addition, the chains are stacked along the b axis via – interactions between the benzene and the naphthalene rings of adjacent molecules, the centroid–centroid distances being 3. 722 (3) and 3. 823 (4) Å.

40|$|A simple {{reproducible}} {{method for}} the ultramicro determination of total and direct serum bilirubin is presented. This method provides a greater sensitivity than that obtained with other colorimetric ultramicro procedures. Total bilirubin values agree with those obtained with the macro Malloy-Evelyn procedure, but direct-reading bili-rubin values {{were significantly higher}} with the presented method. 1 T’HEPRIMARY DIFFICULTY in performing bilirubin determinations on serum volumes of less than 100 J. L 1. has been the lack of sensitivity of procedures {{in the range of}} low bilirubin concentration. This problem becomes more pronounced when the assay is performed to estimate the so-called “direct-reading ” bilirubin concentration. A relatively more sensitive diazo procedure has been proposed by Bruckner (1), who used principles originally developed by Jendrassik et al. (2, 3). An improved coupling reagent is utilized in performing this procedure and phosphoric acid is used to prevent turbidity in the reaction mixtures as well as to alter the color of the azobilirubin in solution. In estimating the direct bilirubin concentration, the phos-phoric acid is added prior to the coupling reagent. The resulting low pH of the solution inhibits coupling of the indirect-reacting pigment. The increased sensitivity of this method is because the assay may be performed with a relatively high concentration of serum in the reac-tion mixture, and according to Bruckner (1), enhanced spectral ab-sorption of the <b>azo</b> <b>pigments.</b> The increased sensitivity of the method described above appeared to justify the effort to develop an ultramicro determination for total and direct bilirubin, utilizing the basic principles of Bruckner’s assay...|$|R
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has become}} one of the most importantvibrational analytical techniques for the investigationof paint samples and notably for organic pigments. For theanalysis of modern materials, especially for synthetic inorganicand organic pigments the prospect of using Ramanspectroscopy is an alternative to e. g. Py-GC-MS. It providesenough information allowing for a broad characterization ofcolourants either in raw samples, on cross-sections or insitu. One of the advantages of Raman spectroscopy overFTIR analysis is that it allows the detection of weak IR frequenciessuch as stretching vibrations of chemical groups,e. g. the nitro group in <b>azo</b> <b>pigments,</b> which represents thebiggest family of organic pigments found in paintings. The purpose of this paper is, firstly, to complement existingdatabases with data on both yellow and orange pigments,mainly found in artist paints, and secondly, to introduce theanalysis of selected fluorescent pigments. The latter are ofaesthetic interest as they are widely employed in the industry(paints, plastics, textiles) and of conservation interestdue to their ageing behaviour. A short list of organic pigmentshas been drawn according to their use in paintings(artwork and industrial paints), to which some inorganicpigments also found in artworks, were added. This hasbeen complemented with some pigments which are mainlyfound in automotive paints. Analyses were performed withdispersive micro-Raman spectroscopy. The prospect ofinduced fluorescence background led to the preferentialuse of a diode laser at 785 nm. Results show that Raman spectra allow for characterizationof various chemical groups in organic pigments. In the caseof fluorescent pigments, differentiation is more difficultsince the formulations of such pigments/dyes are quitecomplex. Further research on this topic must be undertakenboth to further the knowledge of photostability of thesematerials and to improve characterization using vibrationalanalytical techniques. Some of the conclusions drawn from this study were used for identification of two fluorescent paint samples taken from a late 20 th century Ben (Benjamin Vautier, 1935 -) artwork...|$|R

More conclusively, FTIR spectra collected from the same areas show several distinctive features all closely resembling those of the <b>azo</b> β-naphthol <b>pigment</b> Toluidine red (also known as PR 3), as reported in Fig.  3 b. The identification has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy which gave spectral profiles (Fig.  3 c) consistent with that of PR 3 [16]. In the painting Mural (1943, University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City),the use of PR 3 in mixture with vermillion was also suggested by Gelardi et al. [17] by Py-GC/MS. The reflectance profile (Fig.  3 d) shows a strong absorption in the blue-green region and an inflection point at 625  nm; although rather unspecific, those spectral features are compatible with the reference PR 3 spectrum reported in [18].|$|R
40|$|The Sam Francis’s colors, {{literally}} {{described as}} vivid, saturated, pure, vibrant intense and rich, largely {{contribute to the}} unique character of his work. This idiosyncrasy explains the interest in conducting an extended study on the Francis’ painting materials through analytical techniques. On the other hand, many Francis’ paintings display colored surfaces that exhibit bronzing, fluorescent or opalescent effects. As a consequence, retouching paint losses from Sam Francis works may become a challenging task for the involved conservators, the degree of the color matching required in the imitative technique being particularly difficult to attain, {{in the presence of}} such surfaces. Furthermore, the attained degree of the color match has to be conserved in all conditions of illumination and observation. The use of pigments chemically similar to the original ones is often necessary for matching highly chromatic pigments. Though, many modern synthetic organic pigments (SOPs) possess high color strength. That is why the characterization of the Francis palette would provide helpful information to the conservators, which have to deal with this type of issue. The upcoming Getty publication Sam Francis: The Artist’s Materials, planned for 2016, offered the opportunity for in-depth analyses of hundreds paint samples. Almost three hundreds of paint fragments supplied by the Sam Francis Foundation have been investigated at the GCI laboratory, by using three complementary analytical techniques, Py-GC-MS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. The Raman spectroscopy {{is one of the most}} efficient techniques for identifying SOPs in paint systems, while the Py-GC-MS and FTIR methods provide essential information concerning the binding media. The analyzed paint fragments were sampled from twenty-nine canvases and works on paper, made between 1946 and 1992. Although, primary established in Southern California, Sam Francis spent numerous long journeys in different places around the world, including Paris, Bern, Mexico City, New York and Tokyo. However, the material study has outlined the uninterrupted use of` certain classes of SOPs in specific colors. For example, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) pigments were systematically detected in the blue and green samples, while <b>azo</b> <b>pigments</b> have been identified in most of the yellow areas sampled from post 1940 s works. Regardless of the support and the paint technique, the Francis’ blues primary contain Ultramarine and/or CuPc blue pigments. And, it has been shown that the bronzing blue surfaces noticed for some of the investigated artworks correspond to PB 15 -based paint films. The present study has also underlined the recurrent use of perinone orange and dioxazine violet in fluorescent orange and purple area. Despite the early introduction of SOPs, on the Francis’ palette, the works dating from the 1940 ’s remained mainly composed of traditional inorganic pigments, for instance lead white and red, chrome yellow, viridian and iron oxides. Interestingly, various binding media, i. e. Shellac gum, modified and unmodified oils, PVA, alkyd resins and acrylic copolymers have been identified. Actually, the investigated samples have pointed out the frequent combination of more than three types of binders on a same painting. Through the identification of the various SOPs used by Francis over fifty years, this research provide helpful information for selecting the most appropriate retouching pigments. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{launched}} the 18 -month project "Tattoos and Permanent Make-up" {{with the aim}} of collecting data about the use, the ingredients, the EU market and possible health problems associated to tattoo and permanent make-up (PMU) inks. The report on work package 1 (2015, Piccinini P. et al.) is available at [URL] The present report is the outcome of the work package 2 which aims to describe the status of tattoo and PMU practices like tattoo prevalence in the population, including the removal processes, details on service providers and ink manufacturers, tattoo and PMU market, inks' chemical composition, RAPEX notifications and national market surveillance. The information was gathered through questionnaires sent to 32 national authorities (all EU MS and EFTA countries), plus OECD Secretariat, 38 ink manufacturers/distributors/private labels and 23 tattooists/PMU professionals' associations. Replies were collected from 24 EU/EFTA national authorities, 4 non-EU/EFTA countries, 7 ink manufacturers/ distributors/private labels and 10 associations. In addition, we reviewed thoroughly data available from other sources like scientific literature, RAPEX (Rapid Alert System for dangerous non-food products) notifications and national surveillance reports, as of May 2015. The main findings show that: Tattoo and PMU inks are complex chemical mixtures containing several ingredients. The main ingredients are the colorants, pigments in particular; more than 100 of them have been identified in tattoo and PMU inks. These pigments are not produced specifically for such application and a risk assessment taking into account their injection and permanence into the human body is not carried out. An additional identified risk is the presence of impurities; in fact tattoo and PMU inks' purity is on average around 70 - 90 %. <b>Azo</b> <b>pigments,</b> group to which most of the organic colorants in use belong, are proved to release potentially carcinogenic aromatic amines when exposed to solar, UV or laser irradiation. It is estimated that around 12 % of the whole European population, all ages comprised, are tattooed (estimation based on available data from 14 Member States) and more than 20 % in the United States. Higher tattoo prevalence was reported in young population, including adolescents. While traditionally men were more tattooed than women, figures show that this trend in Europe, Australia and North America is changing. Nowadays in a number of cases the tattoo prevalence in women is higher than in men, particularly in young generations. Most of the tattoo inks used in Europe are imported from the United States, while PMU inks are mostly produced in Europe. The European manufacturers are mainly based in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain. With regards to the tattoo artists performing the tattoos, the number of "non-professional tattooists" might represent up to 10 times the number of "registered/professionals" ones. Around 95 % of the 126 RAPEX alerts notified for tattoo/PMU during the last decade related to chemical risks: hazardous chemicals and/or impurities (such as carcinogenic aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, sensitizers, preservatives and heavy metals). The remaining 5 % concerned microbiological risks, which are mainly {{due to the lack of}} sterility of the inks before opening and from the use of tap water for their dilution. Two thirds of the RAPEX notifications pertain to products imported, with the highest percentages from the United States. JRC. I. 1 -Chemical Assessment and Testin...|$|R
