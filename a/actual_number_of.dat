40|$|Objective: The {{national}} guideline on oesophageal carcinoma's recommendation <b>of</b> {{a minimum}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 10 resections {{per year and}} {{the intervention of the}} Dutch Health Care Inspectorate have highlighted hospitals' 'need to score' on the public quality indicator for the annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> oesophageal resections. To determine whether low-volume hospitals are inclined to adjust their numbers, we studied the difference between the reported and <b>actual</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> oesophageal resections in 2005 and 2006. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Hospitals were asked to submit all operative reports on resections from 2005 to 2006. Two pairs of evaluators independently labelled all anonymous operative reports from the selected hospitals as resection or non-resection. Settings: Hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants: Ten hospitals that reported 10 or 11 resections in 2006, or an average of fewer than 10 resections per year in the period 2003 - 2006. Interventions: None. Main outcome measure(s) : Difference between the reported and <b>actual</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> oesophageal resections in 2005 and 2006. Results: Oesophageal resection criteria were not met in 7 % of the 179 operative reports from the 10 selected hospitals. The difference between the reported and <b>actual</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> resections in 2005 was not significant, while in 2006 it was. Of the hospitals studied, 70 % actually performed fewer resections than they reported. Conclusion: Our results support the assumption that low-volume hospitals are inclined to adjust their numbers when, because outcomes are public, pressure to report a sufficient number is high. So, external verification of data is essential when this 'need to score' is high. © The Author 2012.

A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing.

5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
