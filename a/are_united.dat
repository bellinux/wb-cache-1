The node-based definition would not include animals like Rugops or Ilokelesia, which are thought to be more basal than Abelisaurus and would be included by a stem-based definition. Within Abelisauridae is the subgroup Carnotaurinae, and among carnotaurines, Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus <b>are</b> <b>united</b> in Carnotaurini.|$|E

5|$|The medieval cathedrals of England, which {{date from}} between {{approximately}} 1040 and 1540, are {{a group of}} twenty-six buildings that constitute a major aspect of the country’s artistic heritage and {{are among the most}} significant material symbols of Christianity. Though diversified in style, they <b>are</b> <b>united</b> by a common function. As cathedrals, each of these buildings serves as central church for an administrative region (or diocese) and houses the throne of a bishop (cathedra, from the Greek). Each cathedral also serves as a regional centre and a focus of regional pride and affection.|$|E
5|$|There {{are among}} other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely {{alongside}} one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way– differently and randomly for each performance– until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they <b>are</b> <b>united.</b>|$|E
5|$|Concerning literature, {{there is}} a great variety of authors, genres, and editions {{produced}} in Polish. For traditional music, many groups <b>are</b> <b>united</b> in the association Ars Musica; this association also includes many choirs, such as Collegium Iuvenum, Collegium Canticorum, and Canticum Novum.

5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals <b>are</b> <b>united</b> at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{visitors}} to Sarawak are predominantly from Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and China.

The public and private bodies in Sarawak hold a biannual event to award the Sarawak Hornbill Tourism Award, an award for achievements within various categories, to recognise businesses and individuals for their efforts in the development of tourism within the state.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories <b>are</b> <b>united,</b> or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, one species of the wildebeest, Connochaetes albojubatus, was {{identified}} in eastern Africa. In 1914, two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced, namely Gorgon a. albojubatus ("Athi white-bearded wildebeest") and G. a. mearnsi ("Loita white-bearded wildebeest"). However, in 1939, the two were once again merged into a single race, Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus. In the mid-twentieth century, two separate forms were recognised, Gorgon taurinus hecki and G. t. albojubatus. Finally two distinct types of wildebeest – the blue and black wildebeest – were identified. The blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus, Gorgon, while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus Connochaetes. Today they <b>are</b> <b>united</b> in the single genus Connochaetes: the black wildebeest being named (C. gnou) and the blue wildebeest, (C. taurinus).|$|E
5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which <b>are</b> <b>united</b> by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, not three {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second upper molars are oval in form and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest <b>are</b> <b>united</b> into a single structure by wear. In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.|$|E

5|$|Abelisauroids are {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} Cretaceous group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species Eoabelisaurus mefi) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species); possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left tibia, right femur and right tibia) were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania. Abelisaurid remains are mainly known in the southern continents, which once made up the supercontinent of Gondwana. When first described in 1985, only Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus were known, both from the Late Cretaceous of South America. Abelisaurids were then located in Late Cretaceous India (Indosuchus and Rajasaurus) and Madagascar (Majungasaurus), which were closely connected {{for much of the}} Cretaceous. It was thought that the absence of abelisaurids from continental Africa indicated that the group evolved after the separation of Africa from Gondwana, around 100 million years ago. However, the discovery of Rugops and other abelisaurid material {{from the middle of the}} Cretaceous in northern Africa disproved this hypothesis. Mid-Cretaceous abelisaurids are now known from South America as well, showing that the group existed prior to the breakup of Gondwana. In 2014, the description of Arcovenator escotae from southern France provided the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Abelisaurids in Europe. Arcovenator presents strong similarities with the Madagascan Majungasaurus and Indian abelisaurids, but not with the South American forms. Arcovenator, Majungasaurus and Indian forms <b>are</b> <b>united</b> in the new clade Majungasaurinae.|$|E
