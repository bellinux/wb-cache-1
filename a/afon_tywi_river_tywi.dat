40|$|The <b>Afon</b> <b>Tywi</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic rivers in Wales and sediments stored in its valley floor record a history of erosion, {{deposition}} and flooding dating back to the end of the last glaciation around 16000 years ago. Analysis of floodplain sediments has provided information about how climate and land cover change have affected river behaviour during past millennia. Migration of the <b>Afon</b> <b>Tywi</b> across its floodplain, punctuated by shorter episodes of river down-cutting, has formed a staircase of terraces, the oldest of which probably formed more than 12000 years ago and the most recent in the last 200 years or so. Radiocarbon dating of organic material found in sediments within former river channels indicates that since c. 3000 BC the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> has down-cut by nearly 4 metres and has eroded, swept and sedimented almost its entire valley floor. Periods of rapid river down-cutting and channel straightening at shortly after AD 1220, 1940 BC and 3020 BC would appear to be associated with major floods and climate change. The historical period (c. 1750 to present) has been characterised by renewed channel bed incision and lateral channel migration leading to the development of multiple meander cut-offs. Major changes in river behaviour have influenced human activity and settlement patterns in the Tywi Valley. The history of Late Quaternary valley floor development has significantly influenced the locations where both prehistoric and historical archaeological finds and sites have been preserved. The destruction and replacement of older valley floor sediments as a result of lateral channel migration has undoubtedly led to the loss of archaeological resource in the middle Tywi valley. However, vertical incision and the burial of sites and artefacts on valley floors through the deposition of overbank sediment, although not destroying the archaeological resource has probably significantly reduced the likelihood of discovery of features and artefacts. In spite of this, some of the older terraces preserve remains of occupation dating from as far back as the Bronze Age...|$|R

5000|$|Legends {{associate}} the cyhyraeth {{with the area}} around the <b>river</b> <b>Tywi</b> in eastern Dyfed, as well as the coast of Glamorganshire. The noise is said to be [...] "doleful and disagreeable", like the groans and sighs of someone deathly ill, and to sound three times (growing weaker and fainter each time) as a threefold warning before the person expires. Along the Glamorganshire coast, the cyhyraeth is said to be heard before a shipwreck, accompanied by a corpse-light.|$|R
50|$|Twm Siôn Cati's Cave is on Dinas Hill, near Ystrad-ffin and Rhandir-mwyn. There is a steep {{ascent to}} the cave, which is {{surrounded}} by trees and boulders, and {{it is necessary to}} crawl inside. Part of the cave roof has collapsed but the cave itself has obviously been visited over many years, as evidenced by the carvings - one reads 1832. It overlooks the confluence of the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> with the <b>River</b> Pysgotwr. The Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales notes that Prichard's vivid descriptions of Twm's cave suggest the author knew the area around Rhandir-mwyn well. Historical accounts have been published by Lynne Hughes (whose book Hawkmoor, was serialised by the BBC in 1977) and three by Welsh-language children's author T. Llew Jones.|$|R
40|$|During {{a three-year}} {{tracking}} {{study on the}} <b>river</b> <b>Tywi</b> in south-west Wales, over 400 adult salmonids were fitted with SAL 3 tags of MAFF design. In all years of study, a proportion of fish were undetected post-tagging or disappeared {{during the course of}} tracking. In order to eliminate or identify tag failure as the cause of 2 ̆ 7 losses, 2 ̆ 7 control experiments were established, with tags drawn from the batches used for fieldwork. This chapter briefly describes results from these control experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{characteristics of}} the adult sea trout stock in the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> were examined between 1988 and 1992 by sampling catches from a temporary main-river trap, and the commercial seine, commercial coracle and recreational rod fisheries. Radio tracking of adults during the spawning season investigated behavioural activities and their possible effects on stock characteristics. Catch effort data from angler log books assessed the annual performance of the rod fishery between 1990 and 1993. The effects of ameliorating the impact of acidification on water quality, benthic macro-invertebrates and juvenile salmonids, through reservoir liming, was studied...|$|R

5000|$|Cantref Mawr means [...] "The Great Cantref". Each cantref {{in medieval}} Wales {{was divided into}} cwmwdau, and a typical cantref would {{be made up of}} two or three cwmwd. Cantref Mawr was made up of seven cwmwdau, which made it one of the largest cantrefs in Wales. Cantref Mawr was an upland area, bounded by the <b>rivers</b> <b>Tywi,</b> Teifi and Gwili. The area at this period was covered in dense scrub which caused {{difficulties}} for invading armies, so that the Cantref Mawr often provided a secure refuge for the princes of Deheubarth when facing an invasion.|$|R

Tracking studies help in the provision of a comprehensive description of the variety offish behaviour patterns in response to factors such as water flow, obstructions and water quality. 3. There are advantages to be gained by complementing fish tracking studies with data collected from fish counters and vice versa. 4. An overall evaluation of NRA fish tracking projects is presented in the wider context of NRA strategic research objectives. 5. The requirement for future development of tracking equipment, improved data analysis techniques, better communication and more immediate report preparation is identified. 6. Individual project evaluation is given for NRA (or the appropriate Water Authority predecessor) tracking studies conducted on the Ribble estuary, the River Tamar, River Torridge, Rivers Test and Itchen, River Lodden, the Welsh River Dee, River Glaslyn, River Taff, <b>River</b> Tawe, <b>River</b> <b>Tywi,</b> <b>River</b> Usk, Rivers Avon and Stour and the River Frome. 7. An outline for future strategic research is provided which identifies particular areas for study:- i) Identification of environmental factors which control the entry of fish into rivers. ii) Improvement of the understanding of the relationship between water flow and upstream movement of salmonids. iii) Examination of the detailed movements and behaviour of fish in relation to obstructions. iv) Closer definition of water quality requirements for salmonid fish. v) Definition of habitat preferences of salmonids in rivers. vi) Subsidiary topics such as the movements of non-salmonid fish and the downstream migration of kelts and juvenile salmonids...|$|R
50|$|A second station (Carmarthen Town) {{was opened}} by the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway in 1860 on its route northwards towards Cynwyl Elfed and Pencader which {{was much better}} sited for the town (on the {{opposite}} side of the river) and this remained in use until its replacement by the current station shortly after the turn of the century. The Town station did however remain in use for goods traffic thereafter beyond the closure of the final portion of the line Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway in September 1973, until the goods yard closed around 1981 - the single track girder bridge over the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> was subsequently removed during 1983.|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis from {{infected}} animals enters surface waters and rivers in runoff from contaminated pastures. We studied the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> in South Wales, United Kingdom, whose catchment comprises 1, 100 km 2 containing {{more than a}} million dairy and beef cattle and more than 1. 3 million sheep. The <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> is abstracted for the domestic water supply. Between August 2002 and April 2003, 48 of 70 (68. 8 %) twice-weekly river water samples tested positive by IS 900 PCR. In river water, the organisms were associated with a suspended solid which was depleted by the water treatment process. Disposal of contaminated slurry back onto the land established a cycle of environmental persistence. A concentrate from 100 liters of finished water tested negative, but 1 of 54 domestic cold water tanks tested positive, indicating the potential for these pathogens to access domestic outlets. In the separate English Lake District region, with hills up to 980 m, tests for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in the high hill lakes and sediments were usually negative, but streams and sediments became positive lower down the catchment. Sediments from 9 of 10 major lakes receiving inflow from these catchments were positive, with sediment cores indicating deposition over at least 40 to 50 years. Two of 12 monthly 1 -liter samples of effluent and a single 100 -liter sample from the Ambleside sewage treatment works were positive for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Since Lake Ambleside discharges into Lake Windermere, which is available for domestic supply, there is a potential for these organisms to cycle within human populations...|$|R

50|$|In 1039, King Iago of Gwynedd {{was killed}} (supposedly {{by his own}} men) and his son Cynan, {{who may have been}} as young as four, was forced into exile in Dublin. Gruffydd, who had already {{recovered}} Powys, expanded into the vacuum. Soon after gaining power, he surprised a Mercian army at Rhyd y Groes near Welshpool and totally defeated it, killing Edwin, brother of the Leofric, Earl of Mercia. He then attacked Dyfed, which his father had ruled but was now under Hywel ab Edwin. Gruffydd defeated Hywel in the Battle of Pencader (1041) and carried off Hywel's wife. Gruffydd seems {{to have been able to}} drive Hywel out of the south, for in 1044 Hywel is recorded returning to the mouth of the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> with a Danish fleet to try to reclaim his kingdom. Gruffydd, however, defeated and killed him in a closely fought engagement.|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} has been {{developed}} for assessing multiple sources of nitrogen in catchments. The model (INCA) is process based and uses reaction kinetic equations to simulate the principal mechanisms operating. The model allows for plant uptake, surface and sub-surface pathways and can simulate up to six land uses simultaneously. The model {{can be applied to}} catchment as a semi-distributed simulation and has an inbuilt multi-reach structure for river systems. Sources of nitrogen can be from atmospheric deposition, from the terrestrial environment (e. g. agriculture, leakage from forest systems etc.), from urban areas or from direct discharges via sewage or intensive farm units. The model is a daily simulation model and can provide information in the form of time series at key sites, or as profiles down river systems or as statistical distributions. The process model is described and in a companion paper the model is applied to the <b>River</b> <b>Tywi</b> catchment in South Wales and the Great Ouse in Bedfordshire...|$|R
