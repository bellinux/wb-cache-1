Two metabolically distinct weight loss pathologies, marasmus (energy deficit) and incipient kwashiorkor (dietary protein deficit), which mimic the critical {{features of the}} human condition were reproduced in weanling C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. In the advanced stages of carcass energy losses we demonstrated the dominance of a type- 2 polarizing influence within the effector/memory T cell compartment, wherein systemic production of interferon(IFN) -γ was depressed and interleukin(IL) - 4 production was sustained. The hormonal response to wasting pathology, which exerts a permissive influence on the aforementioned polarization phenomenon, prompted an investigation into the antiinflammatory and tolerogenic form of immune competence.

40|$|Observation {{weighting}} is {{an essential}} component of GPS stochastic modeling and {{plays a key role in}} reliable outlier detection and parameter estimation. Nowadays, satellite elevation angle and SNR are used as quality indicators for GPS phase measurements in high-accuracy geodetic applications. In comparison with elevation-dependent models, SNR-based weighting schemes represent the reality better, but usually require greater implementation efforts. Relying upon a representative analysis of empirical SNR-based weights, this paper proposes the elevation-dependent exponential weighting function EXPZ, which benefits from realistic SNR-based weights and enables easy software implementation. To process GPS data from a regional network, this <b>advanced</b> <b>weighting</b> scheme is implemented in the Bernese GPS Software 5. 0 and is compared with the conventional elevation-dependent COSZ model in terms of phase ambiguity resolution, troposphere parameter (TRP) estimation, and site coordinate determination. The results show that the proposed EXPZ model significantly attenuates the downweighting effects on low-elevation observations and improves the success rates of ambiguity resolution by about 10 %, the standard deviations of site-specific TRPs by about 40 %, and the repeatability of daily coordinate estimates by up to 2. 3 mm (50 %) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{neural network}} based {{framework}} for semantic event detection in soccer videos is proposed. The framework provides a robust solution for soccer goal event detection {{by combining the}} strength of multimodal analysis {{and the ability of}} neural network ensembles to reduce the generalization error. Due to the rareness of the goal events, the bootstrapped sampling method on the training set is utilized to enhance the recall of goal event detection. Then a group of component networks are trained using all the available training data. The precision of the detection is greatly improved via the following two steps. First, a pre-filtering step is employed on the test set to reduce the noisy and inconsistent data, and then an <b>advanced</b> <b>weighting</b> scheme is proposed to intelligently traverse and combine the component network predictions by taking into consideration the prediction performance of each network.

40|$|Abstract—A key goal of {{performance}} testing is the detection {{of performance}} degradations (i. e., regressions) compared to previous releases. Prior research has proposed the automation of such analysis through the mining of historical performance data (e. g., CPU and memory usage) from prior test runs. Nevertheless, such research has had limited adoption in practice. Working with a large industrial performance testing lab, we noted that a major hurdle in the adoption of prior work (including our own work) is the incorrect assumption that prior tests are always executed in the same environment (i. e., labs). All too often, tests are performed in heterogenous environments with each test being run in a possibly different lab with different hardware and software configurations. To make automated performance regression analysis techniques work in industry, we propose to model the global expected behaviour of a system as an ensemble (combination) of individual models, one for each successful previous test run (and hence configuration). The ensemble of models of prior test runs are used to flag performance deviations (e. g., CPU counters showing higher usage) in new tests. The deviations are then aggregated using simple voting or more <b>advanced</b> <b>weighting</b> {{to determine whether the}} counters really deviate from the expected behaviour or whether it was simply due to an environment-specific variation. Case studies on two open-source systems and a very large scale industrial application show that our weighting approach outperforms a state-of-the-art environment-agnostic approach. Feedback from practitioners who used our approach over a 4 year period (across several major versions) has been very positive. I...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Reliable {{estimates}} of health-related behaviours, such as levels of alcohol {{consumption in the}} population, are required to formulate and evaluate policies. National surveys provide such data; validity depends on generalisability, but this is threatened by declining response levels. Attempts to address bias arising from non-response are typically limited to survey weights based on sociodemographic characteristics, which do not capture differential health and related behaviours within categories. This project aims to explore and address non-response bias in health surveys {{with a focus on}} alcohol consumption. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Scottish Health Surveys (SHeS) aim to provide estimates representative of the Scottish population living in private households. Survey data of consenting participants (92 % of the achieved sample) have been record-linked to routine hospital admission (Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR)) and mortality (from National Records of Scotland (NRS)) data for surveys conducted in 1995, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2010 (total adult sample size around 40 000), with maximum follow-up of 16 years. Also available are census information and SMR/NRS data for the general population. Comparisons of alcohol-related mortality and hospital admission rates in the linked SHeS-SMR/NRS with those in the general population will be made. Survey data will be augmented by quantification of differences to refine alcohol consumption estimates through the application of multiple imputation or inverse probability weighting. The resulting corrected {{estimates of}} population alcohol consumption will enable superior policy evaluation. An <b>advanced</b> <b>weighting</b> procedure will be developed for wider use.

Results One thousand four hundred six patients were analysed (median age 66 years; 50 % female, 63 % KPS ≤ 70). The overall effect of the WLGS on survival was significant as expressed by change in − 2 log likelihood (P < 0. 001) and persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and cancer type and stage (P < 0. 001). Median survival decreased across the weight loss grades ranging from 407 days (95 % CI 312 – 502) —weight loss grade 0 to 119 days (95 % CI 93 – 145) —weight loss grade 4. All cachexia domains significantly deteriorated with increasing weight loss grade, and deterioration was greatest for dietary intake, with a difference corresponding to 0. 87 standard deviations between weight loss grades 0 and 4. The addition of KPS, anorexia, and physical and emotional functioning improved the prognostic accuracy of the WLGS. Likelihood of cachexia progression was greater in patients with weight loss grade 2 (39 %) than that with weight loss grade 0 (19 %) or 1 (22 %). Conclusions The WLGS is related to survival, cachexia domains, and the likelihood of progression. Adding certain cachexia domains to the WLGS improves prognostic accuracy...|$|R
