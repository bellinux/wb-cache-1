5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Tucker is {{introduced}} as J.T. Hellstrom’s (Thad Luckinbill) employer, while pursuing a business deal with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and beginning {{an affair with}} Jill Abbott (Jess Walton). Tucker secretly gains control of Katherine’s company, Chancellor Industries, after she buys stock in a dummy corporation and at a shareholders' meeting, Tucker reveals that he is Kay's long-lost son, and he was behind a woman named Jojo Glover pretending to be her daughter. After years of planning, Tucker had finally gotten his revenge on Katherine for giving him away and he begins slowly dismantling Chancellor Industries by selling its subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Katherine's other son, Brock Reynolds (Beau Kazer) advises Tucker {{to get to know}} their mother, but Katherine refuses to accept him, and Tucker is hurt. He hires Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and plans to sell off Chancellor Industries piece by piece, including Jabot Cosmetics. Adam’s father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) wins Jabot in a bidding war; Tucker refuses to hire Jill at Chancellor Industries. Katherine threatens to reveal Tucker's bribing of Alexander Thomas until she begins feeling guilty and backs off; an impressed Tucker puts <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> the selling of her company. While Katherine and Tucker bond, he asks about his father, Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison), while Jill finds the information on Tucker and runs it in Restless Style magazine. Tucker and Katherine come to an agreement where she gets 51% of Chancellor Industries, but Tucker mistakenly believes Jill and Katherine were working together, and he promises to dismantle the company before their agreement comes into effect. Thanks to Jill, Tucker is investigated by the SEC while he bonds with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who is struggling with letting go of the child she thought was her daughter. Tucker supports her, much to the dismay of her boyfriend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), while he announces his plans to purchase Jabot for himself. Tucker blackmails Katherine into giving him back control of Jabot in exchange for him keeping quiet about Adam giving Victor access to the bids and he offers Ashley the CEO position.|$|E
