40|$|Aims and Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess crown <b>angulations,</b> crown inclinations, and tooth size {{discrepancy}} in a sample population from Davangere, South India. Materials and Methods: One hundred adults (50 male and 50 female) of age 18 - 30 years, with Angle′s class I ideal occlusion and balanced profiles, were selected for the study. Study models were prepared and crown <b>angulations</b> and crown inclinations were measured using a customized protractor device. Bolton′s analysis was used to measure the tooth size discrepancies. Results: Maxillary and mandibular teeth had less crown <b>angulations.</b> Maxillary and mandibular incisors and maxillary molars showed increased crown inclinations, whereas mandibular molars and premolars had less crown inclinations than the original Andrews sample. The mean maxillary and mandibular tooth size ratios, overall and anterior, were similar to Bolton′s ratios. Conclusions: The finding of this study indicates that there are possible racial and ethnic factors contributing to variations in crown <b>angulations</b> and crown inclinations...|$|R

25|$|Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation {{requires}} exact {{positioning of}} the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root {{is considered to be}} optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy <b>angulation</b> or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the best angle to drill the femoral tunnels of the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) and posterior oblique ligament (POL) with concomitant posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction to avoid either short tunnels or tunnel collisions. METHODS: Eight cadaveric knees were studied. Double-bundle PCL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled. Drilling of the sMCL and POL tunnels was performed in 4 different combinations of 0 ° and 30 ° axial (anteriorly directed) and coronal (proximally directed) <b>angulations.</b> Specimens were scanned with computed tomography to document the relations of the sMCL and POL tunnels to the intercondylar notch and PCL tunnels. A minimum tunnel length of 25 mm was required. RESULTS: When the sMCL femoral tunnel was drilled at 0 ° axial and 30 ° coronal (proximally directed) <b>angulations</b> or 30 ° axial (anteriorly directed) and 0 ° coronal <b>angulations,</b> the risk of tunnel collision with the PCL tunnels increased {{in comparison with the}} remaining evaluated <b>angulations</b> (P <. 001). No POL tunnels collided with either PCL tunnel bundle with the exception of tunnels drilled at 0 ° axial and 30 ° coronal (proximally directed) <b>angulations,</b> which did so in 3 of 8 cases (P <. 001). The minimum required tunnel length was obtained in all the sMCL and POL tunnels (P <. 001 and P =. 02, respectively). However, some of those angled at 0 ° on the axial plane violated the intercondylar notch. CONCLUSIONS: When one is performing posteromedial reconstructions with concomitant PCL procedures, the sMCL and POL femoral tunnels should be drilled anteriorly and proximally at both 30 ° axial and 30 ° coronal <b>angulations.</b> The POL femoral tunnel may also be angled 0 ° in the coronal plane. Tunnels at 0 ° axial <b>angulations</b> showed a shorter distance to the intercondylar notch and a higher risk of collision with the PCL tunnels. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Specific drilling angles are necessary to avoid short tunnels or collisions between the drilled tunnels when sMCL and POL femoral tunnels are placed with concomitant PCL reconstruction...|$|R

The C-Arm and the workstation are connected a communicate continuously. For example, when the user virtually rotates the volume on the workstation to view the anatomy from a certain perspective, the parameter of this view can be transmitted to the angio system, which then drives the C-arm to exactly the same perspective for fluoroscopy. In the same way, if the C-arm <b>angulation</b> is changed, this <b>angulation</b> can be transmitted to the workstation which updates the volume to the same perspective as the fluoroscopic view. The software algorithm that stands behind this process is called registration and can also be done with other DICOM images, such as CT or MRT data acquired preoperatively.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the hemodynamic effect of variations in the <b>angulations</b> of the left coronary artery, based on simulated and realistic coronary artery models. Twelve models consisting of four realistic and eight simulated coronary artery geometries were generated with the inclusion of left main stem, left anterior descending and left circumflex branches. The simulated models included various coronary artery <b>angulations,</b> namely, 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, 90 °, 105 ° and 120 °. The realistic coronary <b>angulations</b> were based on selected patient's data with angles ranging from narrow angles of 58 ° and 73 ° to wide angles of 110 ° and 120 °. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to simulate realistic physiological conditions that reflect the in vivo cardiac hemodynamics. The wall shear stress, wall shear stress gradient, velocity flow patterns and wall pressure were measured in simulated and realistic models during the cardiac cycle. Our results showed that a disturbed flow pattern was observed in models with wider <b>angulations,</b> and wall pressure was found to reduce when the flow changed from the left main stem to the bifurcated regions, based on simulated and realistic models. A low wall shear stress gradient was demonstrated at left bifurcations with wide angles. There is a direct correlation between coronary <b>angulations</b> and subsequent hemodynamic changes, based on realistic and simulated models.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of a novel flow {{remodeling}} stent graft (FRSG) on the hemodynamic characteristics in highly angulated abdominal aortic aneurysm based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. An idealized aortic aneurysm with varying aortic neck <b>angulations</b> was constructed and CFD simulations were performed on nonstented models and stented models with FRSG. The influence of FRSG intervention on the hemodynamic performance is analyzed and compared in terms of flow patterns, wall shear stress (WSS), and pressure distribution in the aneurysm. The findings showed that aortic neck <b>angulations</b> significantly influence the velocity flow field in nonstented models, with larger <b>angulations</b> shifting the mainstream blood flow towards the center of the aorta. By introducing FRSG treatment into the aneurysm, erratic flow recirculation pattern in the aneurysm sac diminishes while the average velocity magnitude in the aneurysm sac was reduced in the range of 39 % to 53 %. FRSG intervention protects the aneurysm against the impacts of high velocity concentrated flow and decreases wall shear stress by more than 50 %. The simulation results highlighted that FRSG may effectively treat aneurysm with high aortic neck <b>angulations</b> via the mechanism of promoting thrombus formation and subsequently led to the resorption of the aneurysm...|$|R
