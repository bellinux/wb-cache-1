5|$|In 1970, after {{retiring}} as party secretary, he acquired <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> woodland {{where he could}} resume his passion for forestry. For many years he spent his winters in the US state of Florida, but eventually moved back permanently to Norway.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> {{coloured}} feathers {{found on}} the throat or upper breast of some species of birds. It is a feature found on many male hummingbirds, particularly those found in North America, whose gorgets are typically iridescent. Other species have gorgets, such as the purple-throated fruitcrow and the chukar partridge. The term {{is derived from the}} gorget used in military armor to protect the throat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> {{missing data}} in Google Sky near {{the constellation of}} Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers. A scientist at Google said that the missing data {{is due to a}} glitch in the stitching software used to piece the images together.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} pohutukawa and grass areas, there is <b>a</b> {{southern}} <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> mature tanekaha and <b>a</b> northern <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> puriri (ripe red berries) and taraire. Other large trees include rewarewa, mapou, kowhai, totara, tree ferns, cabbage trees, and kahikatea. Kanuka {{can be found}} on the slopes of the Te Puru creek (the estuarine mangrove salt marsh).|$|R
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, a school bus hits <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> ice, runs through a barrier and crashes into a lake, killing 14 children. The grieving parents are {{approached}} by an out-of-town lawyer, Mitchell Stephens, who is haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his drug-addict daughter. Stephens persuades the reluctant parents and bus driver Dolores Driscoll to file a class action lawsuit against the town and bus company for damages, arguing that the accident is a result of negligence in constructing the barrier or the bus.|$|E
5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> fossilized {{skin from the}} tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E
50|$|The {{surficial}} geology {{in virtually}} all of the area in the vicinity of Kern Glen Creek consists of a till known as Wisconsinan Till. However, there are <b>a</b> few <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> wetlands, peat bogs, and lakes in the watershed. There is also <b>a</b> small <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale near the creek's lower reaches.|$|R

5|$|The {{velvet belly}} is grouped with the Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), brown lanternshark (E. unicolor), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus), and dwarf lanternshark (E. perryi) in having irregularly arranged, {{needle-shaped}} dermal denticles. Its common {{name comes from}} this shark's black ventral surface, which is sharply delineated {{from the rest of}} its body like <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> velvet.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{steadily}} decaying, turning to oxide {{at a rate}} of 0.5–1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces). Eventually Titanics structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, compasses and the telemotor.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Sudlersville, {{the route}} becomes Millington Road and heads north through farm fields with {{intermittent}} residences. MD 313 heads into forested areas as it runs {{a short distance}} {{to the east of}} US 301. It leaves the woodland as it intersects the eastern terminus of MD 544 (Mcginnis Road). The route heads northeast through a mix of agricultural and residential areas before turning east in <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> woodland and passing more farm fields and residences. MD 313 turns northeast into wooded residential areas and enters Millington, where it becomes Sassafras Street.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. <b>A</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} an adult Mitrella scripta grows to a length of about 18 mm. This sea snail is a high spired, biconic columbellid with smooth, unsculptured shells and a denticulated inner surface of the {{external}} lip. The surface of the shell usually is white with <b>a</b> <b>patching</b> <b>of</b> pale brown on the whorls.|$|R

5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Zita {{was sent}} to a {{boarding}} school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. Zita went through <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas {{on the way back to}} Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 12 mm. The forewings are dull ocherous with fuscous dusting and small aggregates of raised black scales forming ill-defined markings. An oblique line of minute black spots forms the inner border of an almost undusted bar, which {{extends from the}} basal fifth of the costa to the fold. Beyond this paler area, in the dusted middle portion of the wing, are several small <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> black scales. Near {{the end of the}} fold is <b>a</b> minute <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> raised black scales and above the end of the fold <b>a</b> larger <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> raised scales is found. There is also <b>an</b> elongated <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> denser dusting on the middle of the costal margin. Around the apex, the dusting is arranged in spots separated by the undusted ground color. The hindwings are brownish ocherous.|$|R
5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit {{for a team that}} had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds {{for the construction of a}} new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
