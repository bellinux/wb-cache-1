I spoke with some of them that week and they jokingly <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by the injuries and departures.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
500|$|Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son, and {{his name}} was {{featured}} on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|E

500|$|While {{still part}} of WCW, Konnan was {{contacted}} by talent scout Pat Patterson on New Year's Eve 1990, {{which led to a}} meeting with Vince McMahon, where the initial idea for what became Max Moon was discussed. According to Konnan, [...] "When I was wrestling in Japan, I saw this Japanese anime cartoon robot on TV that shot confetti and fire. [...] <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew anybody that could design it." [...] Konnan was given an outfit (purchased by the WWF at the cost of $13,000) bedecked with circuitry and a pyrotechnic gun that shot sparkles into the crowd. Konnan recollected later that the costs associated with the costume led to problems between himself and the promotion right from the start.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} he made several guest appearances, {{including}} a 1985 performance at {{a tribute to}} Carl Perkins titled [...] In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised {{to raise money for}} the Birmingham Children's Hospital. The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: [...] "Bob rang me up and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 2012, Winters {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Seattle Sounders Women, under head coach Michelle French, to play with national team members Alex Morgan, Hope Solo, Sydney Leroux, and Stephanie Cox. Of her signing, she said, [...] "Once WPS was suspended, I was obviously really disappointed. I thought about going overseas, but transfer windows were closed and things became really complicated and frustrating...Alex Morgan <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was interested in playing with her on the Sounders. [...] knew I have been living in Seattle. Right after that, I went back and sent [...] an email to find out more information about the Sounders Women. So that's how it all started for me." [...] Winters played in eight matches for the Sounders Women, scored one goal and recorded one assist. The team finished second in the Western Conference with a [...] record. With the national teammates' presence on the team, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at the 4,500 capacity Starfire Stadium. Average attendance during the 2012 season for the Sounders Women was four times higher than the next closest team.|$|E

500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Kasparov {{published}} a sympathetic obituary for Bobby Fischer, writing: [...] "I am often <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever met or played Bobby Fischer. The answer is no, I {{never had that}} opportunity. But even though he saw me {{as a member of}} the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him, I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for what he did for our sport." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cahill later reflected: [...] "They <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{would take}} part, even though I was only 14 {{at the time}} and it was an under-20 tournament. I saw it simply as a chance to go on holiday because my {{grandmother}} was ill at the time in Samoa. It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. I could not have cared less about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and I never expected to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tommy Lee Wallace, the film's art director, spoke admirably about Carpenter during post. [...] " [...] <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could cut}} sound effects. The answer, {{of course was}} 'Sure!' Once again, here I was, a {{perfectly}} green recruit, yet John made {{a leap of faith}} … he further insisted we get the best processing money could, which at that time was the legendary MGM color labs. Finally, he insisted we get the best postproduction sound money could buy, which was Samuel Goldwin Sound, another legend. The expense for this unorthodox approach ate up a huge amount of the budget. The production manager fumed that we were exploiting people to pay for processing— and it was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forty years later, Holloway's son was {{responsible}} for interviewing the eminent lawyers, businessmen, and government officials who applied {{for membership in the}} exclusive Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington between 1988 and 1992. [...] "I was truly amazed at the number of these prospective members who <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were any relation to the admiral who founded the Holloway Plan," [...] recalled the younger Holloway, by then a famous admiral in his own right. [...] "When I answered yes, they would tell me that they wouldn't be sitting there today if it weren't for the Holloway Plan....It had put them through collegeschools like Princeton, Duke University, Caltech, and Stanford. After the Korean War and Vietnam, the opportunities were so great on the outside that many of them left the service and became quite successful in their civilian careers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding SA {{for both}} motor {{movements}} and thoughts, further distinctions {{may be found}} in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness. For example, while typing I have a sense of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; {{this is an example of}} SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions themselves. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements per se but rather, I am involved with the task at hand. [...] If I'm subsequently <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious [...] "attribution" [...] of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, pre-reflective [...] "sense" [...] of agency.|$|E

60|$|The route he {{took was}} by the boulevards: he several times made me {{sit down on the}} seats {{stationed}} under the lime-trees; he did not <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was tired, but looked, and drew his own conclusions.|$|R

2500|$|I {{got a job}} on Hammerstein's Roof at $140 a {{week for}} myself, my horse, {{and the man who}} looked after it. I {{remained}} on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written and performed by Jim Weatherly {{under the title}} [...] "Midnight Plane to Houston", which he recorded on Jimmy Bowen's Amos Records. [...] "It {{was based on a}} conversation I had with somebody... about taking a midnight plane to Houston," [...] Weatherly recalls. [...] "I wrote {{it as a kind of}} a country song. Then we sent the song to a guy named Sonny Limbo in Atlanta and he wanted to cut it with Cissy Houston... he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> minded if he changed the title to [...] "Midnight Train to Georgia". And I said, 'I don't mind. Just don't change the rest of the song.'" [...] Weatherly, in an interview with Gary James, stated that the phone conversation was with Farrah Fawcett and he used Fawcett and his friend Lee Majors, whom she had just started dating, [...] "as kind of like characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks moved, but {{toward the}} window seat; she did not get up {{to move to the}} redesignated colored section.

[...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw me still sitting, he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.'

2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E
2500|$|... "In a gully {{above the}} village, I {{saw the first}} body.

[...] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [...] I didn't count them. I just looked and saw a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head. A couple had what appeared to be bullet wounds knocking out their eyes. I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, 'I've seen enough.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999.

I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E
