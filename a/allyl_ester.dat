To achieve that, various synthetic strategies were developed and examined, all of which relied on a cycloadditive event as a key step to prepare the [3. 4. 0 J-bicyclic framework of (-) -echinosporin. The synthesis was eventually accomplished using the Padwa [3 + 2] cycloaddition-elimination of allenylphenylsulphone to a chiral sugar enone 6 as a key transformation. it provided the first recorded example of this reaction used in complex natural product total synthesis. Following a series of functional group interconversions on this cycloadduct, a mild new method for the C-carboxyalkylation of bromomagnesium ketone enolates was applied to install the C(11) ~carboxylic group of (-) - echinosporin. The quaternary OH-bearing stereocentre was introduced via a substrate~directed osmylative dihydroxylation on a i 3 -keto ester enol 71. The resulting ketone 77 was advanced into 70 via Barton deoxygenation. Following that, the crucial C(8) -C(9) unsaturation was introduced starting from the ketone 70 through a three-step sequence based on the Barton vinyl iodide synthesis and Pd(O) -mediated dehalogenation. Next, a TEMPO-based oxidation was used to bring the C(10) - position to a correct oxidation state.

For years, the Berkowitz group and others have been developing methodology for the synthesis of fluorinated phosphonates. The major part of this thesis work will focus on a new chemoenzymatic approach for the facile and stereoselective synthesis of densely functionalized δ-thio-β,γ-unsaturated- 2 ̆ 6 agr;, 2 ̆ 6 agr;-difluorophosphonate building blocks. The precursor enantioenriched (L) -β-hydroxy- 2 ̆ 6 agr;, 2 ̆ 6 agr;-difluorophosphonate is synthesized by the stereoselective reduction of the corresponding β-keto substrate using an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaADH). The resultant alcohol, upon conversion to a pentafluorophenyl thionocarbonate, undergoes a rapid [3, 3]-sigmatropic thiono-Claisen rearrangement with a half-time (t 1 / 2) of 3 min @ RT. Pleasingly, the one step β-C-O to δ-C-S transformation proceeds with conservation of enantiopurity and in high yield. An Eyring analysis of the temperature dependence of this transformation reveals an unusually positive entropy of activation (ΔS = + 14. 5 e. u.), suggesting a partially dissociative T.

Chapter 2, 3 and 4 describe the controlled ring-opening polymerisation of allyl- functional cyclic carbonate MAC (5 -Methyl- 5 -allyloxycarbonyl- 1, 3 - dioxan- 2 -one) and propargyl- functional cyclic carbonate MPC (5 -Methyl- 5 - propargyloxycarbonyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 2 -one) using organic catalysts. Successful functionalisation of allyl-functional poly(carbonate) s was achieved via radical addition of thiol-containing molecules to the pendant <b>allyl</b> <b>esters</b> (Chapter 2), while functionalisation of propargyl-functional poly(carbonate) s was realised via the Huisgen 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of azides to the pendant propargyl groups (Chapter 3). In addition, the copolymerisation of MAC and MPC and the subsequent orthogonal functionalisation of a copolymer was investigated (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 {{describes the}} copolymerisation of MAC (and MPC) with stereopure lactide, with resulting copolymers with opposite chiralities being succesfully applied in stereocomplexation. Chapters 6 summarises the results obtained in Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 whilst Chapter 7 provides the experimental methodologies.
