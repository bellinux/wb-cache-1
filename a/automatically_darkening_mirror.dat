40|$|A {{system and}} method for flight {{training}} {{and evaluation of}} pilots comprises electronically activated vision restriction glasses that detect the pilot's head position and <b>automatically</b> <b>darken</b> and restrict the pilot's ability {{to see through the}} front and side windscreens when the pilot-in-training attempts to see out the windscreen. Thus, the pilot-in-training sees only within the aircraft cockpit, forcing him or her to fly by instruments in the most restricted operational mode...|$|R
50|$|Lamp {{lifetime}} depends {{primarily on}} the energy regime used for the particular lamp. Low energies give rise to sputter, which can remove material from the cathode and redeposit it on the glass, creating a <b>darkened,</b> <b>mirrored</b> appearance. The life expectancy at low energies can be quite unpredictable. High energies cause wall ablation, which not only gives the glass a cloudy appearance, but also weakens it structurally and releases oxygen, affecting pressure, but at these energy levels the life expectancy can be calculated with {{a fair amount of}} accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Transitions lenses {{are also}} called {{adaptive}} lenses. They are clear indoors {{and at night}} and <b>automatically</b> <b>darken</b> outdoors as light conditions change. They block 100% of UV rays and help to enhance contrast and reduce glare. In addition to original Transitions lenses that are for everyday wear, Transitions Optical also makes Transitions XTRActive lenses that change from light tint indoors to very dark outdoors, and Transitions adaptive sun wear that go from dark to darker outdoors depending on the sun and are available worldwide.|$|R
60|$|When she {{returned}} to Paris she began--still secretly--a larger study in oils. She worked upon it in her own room every moment she could spare from her studio practice, unknown to her professor. It absorbed her existence; she grew thin and pale. When it was finished, and only then, she showed it tremblingly to her master. He stood silent, in profound astonishment. The easel before him showed a foreground of tangled luxuriance, from which stretched a sheet of water like a <b>darkened</b> <b>mirror,</b> while through parted reeds on its glossy surface arose the half-submerged figure of a river god, exquisite in contour, yet whose delicate outlines were almost a vision by the crowning illusion of light, shadow, and atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the poor optical angular properties displayed by the majority of <b>automatically</b> <b>darkening</b> welding filters currently on the market that are based on liquid crystal technology. It is shown that by reducing the twist-angle present in the liquid crystal cell to below that of 90 together with employment of a novel polariser arrangement, an optical shutter design based on a double-cell construction is obtained that boasts a reduced angular transmittance variation when in the activated phase. This gives an optical filter possessing a wide central viewing cone whilst maintaining the remaining optical parameters at a high level. The only point of compromise comes from the voltage increase requirement upon reduction of the twist- angle in order to maintain cell contrast. Although this inflates the power consumption of the system, beneficial effects upon the total light scattering provoked by the device are also observed. The final sections deal with a new mode of operation for a twisted-nematic liquid crystal cell when placed between crossed polarisers together with an interference filter possessing a high optical transmittance over {{the central part of the}} visible spectrum. This mode of operation means that the cell is in a dark state when inactivated. Application of a small stimulating voltage transmutes the unit into the light state, where upon further increment of the driving electronics beyond this point reverts the system back into a low transmittance phase. Such a mode of operation for a twisted-nematic cell offers several advantages over that of the normally white mode when considering the optical lens of an <b>automatically</b> <b>darkening</b> welding filter. In particular, a dark, fail-safe state is provided should the controlling electronics malfunction preventing the unit from holding in a potentially hazardous light phase, a property usually associated with the normally black mode of operation, whilst the fast switching speed from the light to the dark state associated with the normally white mode of operation is maintained. It is shown that there are only two cell types that display this phenomenon and the optical properties of these two systems are analysed in some detail with the view of developing an <b>automatically</b> <b>darkening</b> welding filter based on this technology.

[...] The maid, with smile suppressed and sly, [...] The toil unwonted saw him try; [...] For seldom, sure, if e'er before, [...] His noble hand had grasped an oar: [...] Yet with main strength his strokes he drew, [...] And o'er the lake the shallop flew; [...] With heads erect and whimpering cry, [...] The hounds behind their passage ply.

60|$|But {{whenever}} {{any attempt}} was made to draw him to speak of the past, of his mother, or of where he came from, his brow lowered gloomily, and he assumed that kind of moody, impenetrable gravity, which children at times will so strangely put on, and which baffle all attempts to look within them. Zephaniah Pennel used to call it putting up his dead-lights. Perhaps it was the dreadful association of agony and terror connected with the shipwreck, that thus confused and <b>darkened</b> the <b>mirror</b> of his mind the moment it was turned backward; but it was thought wisest by his new friends to avoid that class of subjects altogether--indeed, it was their wish that he might forget the past entirely, and remember them as his only parents.|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} of this ancient fortress was remarkable. It occupied a small rocky islet {{in a mountain}} lake, or tarn, as such a piece of water is called in Westmoreland. The lake might be about a mile in circumference, surrounded by hills of considerable height, which, except where old trees and brushwood occupied the ravines that divided them from each other, were bare and heathy. The surprise of the spectator was chiefly excited by finding a piece of water situated in that high and mountainous region, and the landscape around had features which might rather be termed wild, than either romantic or sublime; yet the scene was not without its charms. Under the burning sun of summer, the clear azure of the deep unruffled lake refreshed the eye, and impressed the mind with a pleasing feeling of deep solitude. In winter, when the snow lay on the mountains around, these dazzling masses appeared to ascend far beyond their wonted and natural height, while the lake, which stretched beneath, and filled their bosom with all its frozen waves, lay like {{the surface of a}} <b>darkened</b> and broken <b>mirror</b> around the black and rocky islet, and the walls of the gray castle with which it was crowned.|$|R
40|$|Metal oxides like Tungsten Oxide (WO 3) {{are well}} {{documented}} and characterized in the literature, with uses in <b>darkening</b> windows and <b>mirrors,</b> flat computer displays, solar panel cooling, and sensors (of {{interest in this}} study). Ti doping of WO 3 is less documented and {{the focus of this}} study. Sample thin films of pure WO 3 and varyingly Ti doped WO 3 were prepared using Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering (RF) (13. 56 MHz) to grow thin films on a silicon substrate. This study aims to compare multiple Ti doping percentages in WO 3 theoretically and then compare with experimental data taken from thin films of various Ti doping levels grown at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 400 0 °C. Characterization of the materials was to be conducted using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and other theoretical and simulated approaches. Theoretical calculations optimized Ti doping at somewhere between 6. 25 % and 12 %. Experimental data indicates that under the given growing conditions optimal Ti doping is 5 %. The percentage of Ti may be able to be increased and the material retain desired characteristics with an increased growth temperature above 400 0 °C as annealing samples post-growth has no positive impact on the thin film structure. ...|$|R
40|$|The VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB) is {{designed}} with 3 gain stages: Low (LGS), Mid (MGS) and High (HGS) to span bright daytime to moonlit night earth scene signal levels. The published at-launch DNB relative spectral response (RSR) {{is based upon}} the LGS spectral measurements, since it was well measured in the pre-launch test program and the LGS can be calibrated by the on-board solar diffuser (MGS and HGS saturate on the SD). The LGS RSR however does not fully represent the spectral characteristics of nighttime DNB data from the MGS and HGS. Nighttime data users who apply the detailed DNB spectral characteristics in their analyses should use modulated RSR appropriate to the MGS and HGS observations. The RSR modulation is due to spectral darkening of the 4 mirrors of the S-NPP VIIRS telescope, which were contaminated with tungsten oxides in fabrication. These tungsten oxides are ‘in family’ with transition lenses on eyeglasses that darken when exposed to sunlight but do not recover when VIIRS goes into darkness because VIIRS in space is in a vacuum (transition lenses require atmospheric oxygen to recover). The on-going <b>mirror</b> <b>darkening</b> has caused a time-dependent shift in DNB RSR towards blue wavelengths. This presentation will provide access to the correct RSR to use for S-NPP DNB nighttime data over the mission time on-orbit. The changes in characteristics will be described in engineering terms to facilitate clear user understanding of how to handle RSR for nighttime observations over the mission lifetime...|$|R
