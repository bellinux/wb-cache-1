2500|$|Jellyfish are {{not adapted}} to closed spaces. They depend on {{currents}} to transport them {{from place to}} place. Professional exhibits feature precise water flows, typically in circular tanks to avoid trapping specimens in corners. The Monterey Bay Aquarium uses {{a modified version of}} the kreisel (German for [...] "spinning top") for this purpose. The outflow is spread out over a large surface area and the inflow enters as a sheet of water in front of the outflow, so the jellyfish do not get sucked into it. As of 2009, jellyfish were becoming popular in home aquariums. These home aquariums generate this special water flow pattern using an <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> and require special food for the jellyfish, which can be shipped from suppliers to their final destination.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{well-established}} method for vertical transport of liquids and solid– liquid mixtures. The {{objectives of the}} present study are to evaluate the performance of a pump under predetermined operating conditions and to optimize the related parameters {{for the use of the}} pump for two-phase mixtures of air and water when a compressor is readily available. This paper is focused on the general mathematical functions applicable to <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> installations. The effect of various design parameters on the performance of <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> is presented. A user-friendly computer program is developed on the basis of the optimization of influencing variables. This program will be useful for the design and installation of an <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> handling air–water mixtures. A comparative study of an <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> with a centrifugal pump handling two-phase mixtures is also discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{accelerated}} cleanup at the Savannah River Site (SRS), efforts are underway {{to increase the}} glass melt rate and hence the high level waste processing throughput at the SRS Defense Waste Processing Plant Facility (DWPF). One of the proposed process/equipment improvements is a glass <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump.</b> The use of a glass <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> to increase melt rate in the DWPF Melter has been investigated via several techniques including lab scale testing on various melters. The final test before implementation in DWPF was a long-term life cycle test (several months in duration) on a full size pump. The <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> was successfully tested and no major problems were found. Based on this test a unit was designed and fabricated for DWPF and was installed in the DWPF Melter in February 2004...|$|E
40|$|Relations {{between the}} flow pattern and the {{characteristics}} of <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> were analyzed experimentally {{and the effects of}} the type of air supply nozzle, length of air-lift pipe and submergence ratio were examined. The air-lift pipe was constructed of transparent polyacrylate pipe with 25. 5 mm I. D. and 2. 45 m or 4. 05 m length. Two types of air supply nozzle, namely the upward and the sideward air injection types, were used.

40|$|Since {{turbulence}} is {{an important}} factor for the growth of microscopic algae, the effect of mixing intensity and mixing time, has been assessed by means of <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> as an alternative technology for the agitation of algal cultures. Batch culture experiments in enriched sea water were carried out indoors with Chlorella in 100 liter tanks and outdoors with natural phytoplankton populations in 70 m³ tanks. The respective culturing depths in these tanks were 25 and 180 cm. The role of the mixing was also evaluated against that of the pH regulation of the cultures. Mixing with <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> increased the algal growth rate significantly in comparison to non-agitated cultures. The yields were also much higher (up to 30 %) in mixed than in non-mixed cultures. Another beneficial effect of air-lift mixing in algal cultures is the pH-stabilization of the medium by the carbon dioxide present in the air bubble in the pipes. With regard to mixing intensity and mixing time it is emphasized that for each type of culturing tank the most economical aeration regime must be found for which the algal output is maximal...|$|R
40|$|Pumping of liquids using {{two-phase}} flow has been examined experimentally in small <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> with 12 - 19 mm bore plexiglass tubes. An air injection system was devised {{to create and}} maintain 'perfect' slug flow in the vertical riser tube. An equation has been derived, based on momentum conservation considerations, which correlates well with the measurements obtained. Slip variation, or liuid holdup, between the two phases {{and the formation of}} the 'entrance' section part of the pump (suction pipe) were taken into consideration.

40|$|Now a days, it {{is a basic}} {{necessity}} {{to have a very}} highly reliable pump with low maintenance. Moreover, for pumping of various kind of fluid like corrosive, abrasive, or even radioactive, an <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> is very much useful. The only negative point of the ALP is that it has very low efficiency. Therefore, the goal is to perform an exhaustive research to increase the performance of the <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump.</b> The purpose of the present effort is to capture the performance of air lift pump when it is operated in different flow regimes. To fulfill this objective, an <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> is designed and numerically simulated using commercial software ANSYS. The results produced have been validated with the experimental data and have found to be in accordance with it. The pump works under two-phase flow condition with air and water as the two phases. Simulations were performed by varying the air mass flow rates. It is inferred that AMFR played a dominant role in improving the pump’s performance and efficiency. It is concluded that for obtaining a good efficiency in an ALP, it should be operated either in slug or slug-churn flow regime...|$|E
40|$|Bubble pump (BP), an {{essential}} component in coffee percolators, is used to drive solar water heating systems and single pressure absorption refrigerators. However, its mass flow rate cannot be readily predicted. Heat input, tube diameter and submergence ratio affect its mass flow rate. BP has the same working concept as <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump,</b> but its flow is complicated due to the condensation of vapour bubbles. Neither curve fitting models, nor <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> models, can predict the mass flow rate with high fidelity. A new model based on the pumping characteristics of BP is presented and verified by a water based setup at atmospheric pressure. Results show that the average errors for the BP with tube diameter of 6 - 12 mm, and for the BP with submergence ratio of 0. 5 - 0. 8 are 13 % and 11 %, respectively. The BP performance increases when the tube diameter decreases or the submergence ratio increases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The mean aim of {{this work}} is to study the Air-lift pumps {{characteristics}} according to design parameters such {{as the percentage of}} the distance between throat section and nozzle and the driving air pressure, suction head and also study the effect of each parameter on the air lift pump characteristics {{in order to have a}} better performance of such pump under various conditions. A certain geometry for <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> designed and manufactured. The experiments show that there must be careful in increasing the suction head, and a balance must be considered between the suction head and the driving air volumetric flow rate. While the effect of increasing air pressure will stop at certain maximum of the ratio of the volumetric flow rate of water and air that is any increase in air pressure will meet no change ratio of the volumetric flow rate of water and air, While Increasing S/Dth will leads to decrease in the percentage of ratio of the volumetric flow rate of water and air because the optimum S/Dth so that at this value we will have the best performance and any other values for S/Dth the percentage of ratio of the volumetric flow rate of water and air will decreases, but this effect is not so clear and it could be neglected. The pump performance is not so sensitive with the change of S/Dth after a certain value, this information will help in the use of the <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> in several applications using the predetermined operating conditions...|$|E

The water was circulated through a biological filter {{by means of}} <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> {{for a period of}} one week to remove the undissolved particles prior to use in the hatchery operation. The experiments were initiated during 1989 and the hatchery has been working on pilot scale since June, 1990. The larvae in all the experiments were fed with egg-custard, Mona and Artemia nauplii. The survival rate varied from 5 to 52 % in the 12 experiments.

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} work is {{quantifying}} the mechanical stress generated by some major process equipment used in massive microalgae culturing plants (centrifugal and <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps,</b> and nozzles) and highlighting its effects on the microalgal population. Two microalgal species were used as test cases: Chlorella vulgaris (unicellular) and Scenedesmus dimorphus 1237 (colonial). The evaluation of the shear effect on algal growth was carried out through measurement of absorbance, photosynthetic activity (oxygen evolution) and variable chlorophyll fluorescence. Cell aggregate development/breakage was effectuated by visual inspection and light scattering. The use of centrifugal Pumps for culture recycling strongly affected the growth of C. vulgaris, while nozzles effects were confined to aggregate breakage of S. dimorphus. The analysis of experimental data {{is supported by the}} consideration of hydrodynamic stress calculated by: shear rate, shear stress, stress volumes/times, energy dissipation rates, and turbulence microscale size.

Airlift pumps {{operating}} in two-phase gas-liquid flow are investigated {{with a view}} to establishing an analytical technique to aid in theoretically modelling <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> behaviour. Extensive work on two test facilities constructed at the University of Cape Town's Hydrotransport Research facility has been done. Various components needed for the analysis are investigated.

40|$|In the {{previous}} report, {{the relations between}} the flow pattern and the characteristics of air-lift pumps were analyzed experimentally and the effects of the type of air supply nozzle, length of air-lift pipe and submergence ratio were examined. Then it was concluded that the characteristics of air-lift pumps could be expressed well in terms of nondimensional numbers such as water Froude number, air Froude number and submergence ratio. In this report, the experimental investigations about the characteristics of transportation for solid particles by <b>air-lift</b> <b>pump</b> are tried and following results are obtained. (1) The results concerned with amount of air supplied and amount of solid particles lifted are different for the reason of differences of volume ratio of solid particles and mixture, submergence ratio or supplying equipment for solid particles.

40|$|Introduction of gas to {{liquid in}} a {{vertical}} tube results in a hold-up of bubbles and related decrease of average density. It can be employed in <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> for transporting liquid upwards or in a closed loop to agitate liquid in gas-lift reactors. Popular equipment of hydrometallurgy is a pachuca tank, large slender cylinder with an air-lift riser in central position. It is used for leaching processes, where abrasive particles are handled in large volumes of extremely corrosive liquids, and therefore moving parts should be avoided. Amount of gas, required to agitate liquid efficiently and to keep solid particles suspended is an important quantity. Suggested model takes into consideration rising velocity of bubbles, settling velocity of particles, and pressure loss. Friction coefficient is determined from pilot plant data with air|water system. Superficial velocity of liquid {{as a function of}} gas flow rate for pure liquids and superficial velocity of solid particles as a function of gas flow rate for the settling suspensions are results of the simulation of the process.

40|$|Full {{numerical}} simulations ofthree-dimensional {{flows of}} two or more immiscible fluids of different densities and viscosities separated by a sharp interface with finite surface tension are discussed. The method used is based on a finite difference approximation f the full Navier-Stokes quations and explicit racking of the interface between the fluids. Preliminary simulations ofthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the motion of bubbles are shown. 1. Introduct ion The considerable recent progress in under-standing complex single-phase flows can be at-tributed to the development of experimental techniques that allow clear visualization of fluid structures (such as LIF) and detailed velocity measurements, and numerical methods that al-low simulations of realistic (although simple) unsteady, fully three-dimensional flows. For flows that consist of two (or more) phases, formidable difficulties are still encountered in both experimental and numerical work. The difficulty in penetrating the flow field visually limits the experimental observations (although ingenious techniques have been developed in special circumstances), while on the numerical side, the difficulties associated with the advec-tion of interfaces between two dissimilar fluids have limited studies to simple cases. Multi-fluid systems are of considerable impor-tance for a large number of natural and tech-nological processes. A list of just a few appli-cations includes spray combustion, boiling, air stripping of contaminants, evaporative cooling, <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps,</b> blending, mixing and emulsifi-cation.

40|$|Started in Fall 2015, Project OASIS (Optimizing Aquaponic Systems to Improve Sustainability) is an {{interdisciplinary}} capstone project {{with the goal}} of designing a sustainable and affordable small-scale aquaponic system for use in developing nations to tackle the problems of malnutrition and food insecurity. Aquaponics is a symbiotic relationship between fish and vegetables growing together in a recirculating system. The project’s goals were to minimize energy consumption and construction costs while using universally available materials. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software OpenFOAM was used to create transient and steady-state models of fish tanks to visualize velocity profiles, streamlines, and particle movement. CFD and small scale experiments showed vertical manifolds were more efficient than horizontal inlets. The components’ layout was analyzed to minimize head losses and airlifts were used instead of traditional water pumps. Full-scale research and traditional systems were constructed for side-by-side comparison of biological and energy factors. Flow improvements and use of <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumps</b> dropped energy consumption 40 % when compared to a traditional system of the same size. Using local and recycled materials where possible decreased the cost of the UNH pilot system by 27 %. The team also partnered with Forjando Alas, a non-profit in Uvita, Costa Rica. During a January 2016 assessment trip, four members spent a week gathering data and building relationships with the community to develop a user-centered design.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to measure the}} efficiency with which carbon dioxide was stripped from freshwater (0 parts per thousand) and saline water (35 parts per thousand NaCl) passing through an air-lift at 15 degrees C. The air-lift was constructed of 50 mm (OD) PVC pipe submerged 95 cm in a tank, had an adjustable air injection rate, and could be adjusted to three lifting heights: 11, 16 and 25 cm. The gas to liquid ratio (G:L) was high (similar to 1. 9 - 2. 0) at low water discharge rates (Q(w)) and represented the initial input energy required {{to raise the water}} up the vertical riser section to the discharge pipe. The <b>air-lift</b> increased in <b>pumping</b> efficiency rapidly thereafter, to a G:L minima of 0. 3 - 0. 6 at 60 - 70 L min(- 1). After this point the G:L ratio increased with Q(w), representing decreasing <b>air-lift</b> <b>pumping</b> efficiency. The CO 2 concentration of the influent and effluent water was measured using submersible infrared CO 2 probes over a range of influent CO 2 concentrations. The CO 2 mass transfer coefficient [(k(L) a) (20) ] ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 468. Increasing lift height increased mass transfer, which was attributed to both the increased G:L ratio and the contact time inside the air-lift. The relative effect of lift height and pumping rate on mass transfer was such that a 5 cm increase in lift height was approximately equal to a G:L increase of 0. 5. The CO 2 stripping efficiency was effectively the same between salinities, and the influent CO 2 concentration only had a modest effect on CO 2 stripping efficiency. At an influent concentration of 40 mg L- 1 the CO 2 stripping efficiency was 1 - 3 % higher than at an influent of 10 mg L- 1. The relatively minor effects of salinity and influent CO 2 concentration on stripping efficiency contrasted with a companion study investigating the stripping efficiency of a cascade column. The difference was attributed to the low-to-moderate mass transfer efficiencies of the air-lift. A general equation was derived for the airlift that allows one to calculate the mass transfer coefficient for a given lift height, Q(w), or G:L ratio. The mass transfer coefficient can then be used to calculate the CO 2 stripping efficiency for any water type (i. e. temperature, alkalinity, salinity and influent CO 2 concentration).
