40|$|Abstract – A simple, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method {{has been proposed}} for the determination of Vanadium (IV). The method {{is based on the}} catalytic effect of V (IV) on the oxidation of <b>Alkali</b> <b>Blue</b> by potassium bromate at pH 4. The rate of decrease in the absorbance of <b>Alkali</b> <b>Blue</b> (at 572 nm) was proportional to the concentration of V (IV) in the range of 100 - 6000 ng ml- 1. The detection limit was 40 ng ml- 1. The proposed method shows a good selectivity for V (IV) over a wide variety of interference species. It is also valuable in that the presence of a 400 fold excess of V (V) can be tolerable, contrary to many methods for the determination of V (IV) which suffer from severe interference of V (V). This method was successfully applied to the determination of V (IV) in river water, alloy samples and several synthetic samples...|$|E

For this purpose I made use of the following dyes; phenolsulphone phthalein, rohodamin patent blue sup. patent blue V, chrysoidin, safranin, methylviolet, pironin, methylen blue, lithione carmin kongored, indulin, <b>alkali</b> <b>blue.</b> They were injected into the arterial circulation the blood being supplied by 0. 56 Ringer' ssolution through the liver of toads (Bufo japonicus), and them the amount eliminated in the bile duct was measured. Summary. 1) 1 Phenol-sulphone phthalein, 2 rhodamin, 3 patent blue sup., 4 chrysoidin, 5 safranin, 6 methylviolet, 7 pironin, are eliminated from the liver and the amount eliminated is in the order indicated. 2) Hethylen blue, lithion carmin, kongored and indulin are eliminated from the liver only in small quantities or not at all. 3 Patent blue V. and <b>alkali</b> <b>blue</b> {{are not at all}} eriminated from the liver. 4) Elimination of the dyes from the liver is influenced by the poisoning with cyanic acid and stop. Accordingly, I have summalized as follows. The elimination of dyes I used, is not always in proportion with the degree of diffusion measured by gelation and agar-method, and it is always accompanied with oxydation...|$|E
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{functionalised}} carbonaceous adsorbents were prepared {{by means of}} oxidation and nitrogenation of commercially available activated carbon and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The effect of nitrogen and oxygen incorporation on the textural, surface, thermal and sorption properties of the adsorbents prepared was tested. The materials were characterized by elemental analysis, low-temperature nitrogen sorption, thermogravimetric study and determination of the surface oxygen groups content. Sorptive properties of the materials obtained were characterized by the adsorption of methylene and <b>alkali</b> <b>blue</b> 6 B as well as copper(II) ions. The final products were nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched mesoporous adsorbents of medium-developed surface area, showing highly diverse N and O-heteroatom contents and acidic-basic character of the surface. The results obtained in our study have proved that through a suitable choice of the modification procedure of commercial adsorbents {{it is possible to}} produce materials with high sorption capacity towards organic dyes as well as copper(II) ions...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the many {{investigations}} regarding {{the elimination of the}} several dyes from the blood from the kidneys, since Heidenhain, there is as far as I know still a lack of systhematic investigation in relation to the diffusibity of dyes. Hoping to fill up this gap I made the following experiments on toads (Bufo japonicus). Method. For my purpose I used the following dyes; Phenol-sulphone phthalein, picric acid, chrysoidin, bismarckbrown, auranin, pyronin, eosin, methylen blue, safranin, patent blue V., rhodamin, extra B., methylviolet, fuchsin, neutralred, <b>alkali</b> <b>blue,</b> indulin, kongored, indigocarmin, carmin extra B,. As a preminary experiment I measured the rate of diffusion of these dyes on the gelatin and agar. The following list is arranged in the descending order of the diffusion rate of the dyes. 1. phenol-sulphone phtalein, 2. picric acid, 3. rhodamin, 4. patent blue V., 5. chrysoidin, 6. pyronin, 7. safranin, 8. eosin, 9. fuchsin, 10. bismarckbrown, 11. methylen blue, 12. methylviolet B., 13. carmin, 14. neutralred, 15. kongored, 16. alkaliblue, 17. indulin. Summary. 1) 1. picric acid, 2. phenol-sulphone phthalein, 3. rhodamin, 4. patent blue V., 5. chrysoidin, 6. pyronin, 7. safranin, 8. eosin, 9. fuchsin, 10. bismarckblown, 11. methylen blue, 12. methylviolet, 13. carmin,. The above mentioned dyes are very easily eliminaten from the glomerular capsules but from the tubles the elimination is less in amount and the order is the one indicated above. 2) Neutralred, indulin, <b>alkali</b> <b>blue</b> and kongored are eliminated from the glomerular capsules, but not from the tubles. 3) The more elimination of dyes from the tubles abounds the greater is the diffusion. 4) When perfused from the renal portal vein only, the dyes were eliminated in the lumen, but there was either no elimination of water at all or it had been absorbed by the epithelium of the convoluted tubles. 5) The elimination of the dyes from the glomerular capsules is influenced neither by the supply of oxygen in the fluid-flow nor by poisoning with cyanic acid. The elimination of dyes is not always accompanied by oxydation. 6) The elimination of the dyes from the tubles is influenced both by th supply of oxygen in the fluid-flow, and by poisoning with cyanic acid, and elimination of the dyes is accompanied by oxydation. Accordingly, I summarize as follows. The glomerural capsules allow the diffusion into them of all the dyes, which were made use of in the experiments; and regarding the elimination of dyes from the tubles there can hardly be found an explanation in terms of physical chemistory...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the action of <b>alkali</b> on methylene <b>blue</b> (C. I.

In 0. 1 M aq <b>alkali</b> solution, methylene <b>blue</b> forms a highly coloured, lipophilic species that is mainly Bernthsen's methylene violet i. e. a hydrolysis decomposition product, this being contrary to the report of a red N-hydroxy methylene blue adduct. The nature of the heterocyclic nitrogen atom in C. I. Basic Blue 9 is discussed and it is concluded there is no basis for the proposal of nucleophile addition at this site of the dye. In contrast, other thiazine dyes are deprotonated by alkali to form their neutral, highly coloured, lipophilic conjugate base forms...|$|R

30|$|Our {{observations}} {{showed that}} the gilding decorations are performed on a <b>blue</b> <b>alkali</b> glaze. Plant ash was suggested {{to be the source}} of alkali and cobalt was identified as the colouring agent of the glaze. Moreover, trace amounts of arsenic in the composition of the blue glaze was interpreted {{to be associated with the}} colouring agent of the glaze; i.e., cobalt. Furthermore, the gilding decorations were suggested to be achieved by firing gold powder on the pre-fired blue substrate glaze. AFM, SEM and optical microscopy proved that the gold flakes partially penetrated the pre-fired blue substrate glaze.|$|R

Observations are consistent with previous uggestions that levels of alkali feldspar microporosity and levels of fluid alteration (as determined by cathodoluminescence of alkali feldspars) are related phenomena. Oxygen isotope ratios suggest hat the fluid is largely juvenile in origin, with, perhaps, some meteoric (low 6180) component...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. A new {{analysis}} of the violet amphibole from the original ocality where winchite came from agrees with another recent analysis in differing substantially from the original winchite composi-tion and is (K 0. 17 Na 2. 10 Ca 0. 28) (A 10. 19 Ti 0. 00 Fe]. 2 rFe~. 01 Mn 0. 07 Mga. z 4) Sis. 0102 ~. 05 (OH) l. 95. It is essentially a magnesio-arfvedsonite. Al hough {{it is possible that}} the original analysis was unreliable, evidence is given to support he alternative view that there is a wide range of <b>blue</b> <b>alkali</b> and soda calcic amphi-bole compositions atKajlidongri and the name winchite should be restricted to compositions between ferri-winchite CaNaMgsFes+SisO 22 (OH,F, C 1) ~and alumino-winchite CaNaMgsA 1 S. ~sO 22 (OH,F,C 1) 2.

30|$|As {{far as the}} {{chemical}} composition of the blue glaze is concerned, it was an alkali glaze in which cobalt had yielded a dark blue colour (Table  1). On the other hand, 4.29  wt% and 0.37  wt% of potassium and magnesium respectively showed {{that the source of}} <b>alkali</b> in the <b>blue</b> glaze was most probably plant ash. Plant ash has been reported to be the most common fluxing agent used in Persian archaeological vitreous materials [12, 13]. More interestingly, {{the chemical}} composition of the blue glaze was interestingly associated with arsenic (Table  1). As it is generally well-known, the cobalt ores of Qamsar, near Kashsn in central Iran, have always been noted to be the source of supplying cobalt for achieving deep blue colours in glassy materials. These ores have been reported to be cobaltite (CoAsS) and erythrite (Co 3 (AsO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O), which are As-bearing cobalt ores [7, 14]. Thus, the detected arsenic in the composition of the blue glaze can be derived from these sources showing a Persian provenance for the blue colouring agent of the glaze. On the other hand, the absence of bismuth in the composition of the blue glaze can be considered as another evidence of the local provenance as bismuth is reported {{to be associated with the}} blue Co-bearing pigments found in Europe and India [15].|$|R
50|$|The {{total alkali}} content in {{analyzed}} samples of Egyptian blue {{is greater than}} 1%, suggesting the alkali was introduced deliberately into the mixture and not as an impurity from other components. Sources of alkali could either have been natron from areas such as Wadi Natroun and El-Kab, or plant ash. By measuring the amounts of potash and magnesia in the samples of Egyptian blue, it is generally possible to identify which source of alkali had been used, since the plant ash contains higher amounts of potash and magnesia than the natron. However, due to the low concentration of <b>alkali</b> in Egyptian <b>blue,</b> which is a mere 4% or less, compared to glass, for example, which is at 10-20%, identifying the source is not always easy. The alkali source likely was natron, although {{the reasons for this}} assumption are unclear. However, analysis by Jaksch et al. of various samples of Egyptian blue identified variable amounts of phosphorus (up to 2 wt %), suggesting the alkali source used was in actuality plant ash and not natron. Since the glass industry during the Late Bronze Age used plant ash as its source of alkali, there might have possibly been a link in terms of the alkali used for Egyptian blue before and after the introduction of the glass industry.|$|R
40|$|The pH 6 antigen (Psa) of Yersinia pestis {{consists}} of fimbriae with adhesive properties of potential {{importance for the}} pathogenesis of plague, including pneumonic plague. The Psa fimbriae mediate bacterial binding to human alveolar epithelial cells. The Psa fimbriae bound mostly to one component present in the total lipid extract from type II alveolar epithelial cells of the cell line A 549 separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The Psa receptor was identified as phosphatidylcholine (PC) by TLC using <b>alkali</b> treatment, molybdenum <b>blue</b> staining, and Psa overlays. The Psa fimbriae bound to PC in a dose-dependent manner, and binding was inhibited by phosphorylcholine (ChoP) and choline. Binding inhibition was dose dependent, although only high concentrations of ChoP completely blocked Psa binding to PC. In contrast, less than 1 μM of a ChoP-polylysine polymer inhibited specifically the adhesion of Psa-fimbriated Escherichia coli to PC, and type I (WI- 26 VA 4) and type II alveolar epithelial cells. These {{results indicated that the}} homopolymeric Psa fimbriae are multimeric adhesins. Psa also bound to pulmonary surfactant, which covers the alveolar surface as a product of type II alveolar epithelial cells and includes PC as the major component. The observed dose-dependent interaction of Psa with pulmonary surfactant was blocked by ChoP. Interestingly, surfactant did not inhibit Psa-mediated bacterial binding to alveolar cells, suggesting that both surfactant and cell membrane PC retain Psa-fimbriated bacteria on the alveolar surface. Altogether, the results indicate that Psa uses the ChoP moiety of PC as a receptor to mediate bacterial binding to pulmonary surfactant and alveolar epithelial cells...|$|R
