25|$|Pelargonidin-3-glucoside is {{the major}} {{anthocyanin}} in strawberries and cyanidin-3-glucoside is found in smaller proportions. Although glucose {{seems to be the}} most common substituting sugar in strawberry anthocyanins, rutinose, <b>arabinose,</b> and rhamnose conjugates have been found in some strawberry cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Other sugars are not {{fermentable}} at all. After {{consumption by}} the yeast, {{the ratio of}} non-fermentable sugars (the ones that are not consumed by yeast: <b>arabinose</b> and xylose) is between 0.5 and 1.7 grams per litre. Sugars exercise a control over the taste – they balance the spiciness of the acidity and the burning of the alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as <b>arabinose)</b> which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of <b>arabinose</b> (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and <b>arabinose</b> at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{strain of}} E. coli Lenski {{chose to use}} in the {{long-term}} evolution experiment was derived from [...] "strain Bc251", as described in a 1966 paper by Seymour Lederberg, via Bruce Levin, who had used it in a bacterial ecology experiment in 1972. The defining genetics traits of this strain were: T6r, Strr, r−m−, Ara− (unable to grow on <b>arabinose).</b> Lenski designated the original founding strain as REL606. Before the beginning of the experiment, Lenski isolated an Ara+ variant [...] of the strain in which a point mutation in the ara operon had restored growth on <b>arabinose,</b> which he designated as strain REL607. When beginning the long-term evolution experiment, Lenski founded six populations with six individual Ara− colonies of REL606. These populations are referred to as Ara-1 through Ara-6. Lenski also founded six more populations from six individual Ara+ colonies of REL607. These are referred to as populations Ara+1 through Ara+6. The marker differences permit strains to be differentiated on Tetrazolium <b>Arabinose</b> plates, on which Ara− colonies appear red, while Ara+ colonies appear white to pink. Over the course of the experiment, each population has accumulated a large number of distinct mutations, which permit further means of identifying strains by their population of origin.|$|E
2500|$|The enriched motifs {{have been}} {{proposed}} to follow convergent evolution, suggesting they are [...] "optimal designs" [...] for certain regulatory purposes. For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors. The galactose utilization system of E. coli contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization operon galETK, potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted. The feed-forward loop in the <b>arabinose</b> utilization systems of E.coli delays the activation of <b>arabinose</b> catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways. Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of Xenopus, the feed-forward loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, {{in the level of}} β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels. Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an adaptation for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.|$|E
2500|$|Halostagnicola larsenii is a halophilic, neutrophilic, chemo-organotroph {{and uses}} oxygen as its {{terminal}} electron acceptor. H. larsenii can utilize {{a variety of}} carbohydrates such as fructose, glycerol, lactose, glucose, <b>arabinose,</b> acetate, ribose, starch, maltose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glutamate, and propionate as substrates for growth. Growth substrates were determined {{through the use of}} the isolation medium, which contained the substrate being tested along with yeast extract. [...] Additionally, H. larsenii undergoes assimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite to ammonia. This process differs from nitrate reduction because it occurs aerobically and uses ferrodoxin as an electron donor.|$|E
2500|$|Experimental {{fields of}} Salicornia have been planted in Ras al-Zawr (Saudi Arabia), Eritrea (northeast Africa) and Sonora (northwest Mexico) {{aimed at the}} {{production}} of biodiesel. The company responsible for the Sonora trials (...) claims [...] between 225 and 250 gallons of BQ-9000 biodiesel can be produced per hectare (approximately 2.5 acres) of salicornia, and is promoting a $35 million scheme to create a [...] salicornia farm in Bahia de Kino. Stems and roots of Salicornia brachiata plants had high cellulose contents (ca. 30%), whereas tender stem tips contents low cellulose content (9.2%). Salicornia brachiata revealed the dominance of rhamnose, <b>arabinose,</b> mannose, galactose, and glucose, with meager presence of ribose and xylose in their structural polysaccharide.|$|E
2500|$|Transformed oligonucleotides are {{incorporated}} into the cellular DNA through λ-red- and Cas9 endonuclease-mediated homologous recombination. [...] λ-red is activated when <b>arabinose</b> binds to expressed AraC, inducing dimerization of the AraC protein and subsequent DNA binding to activate the promoter [...] prior to oligonucleotide transfection. This step is followed by induced expression of the Cas9 nuclease and the sgRNA through binding of anhydrotetracycline to the PTET promoter. Cas9, with {{the guidance of the}} transformed sgRNA, identifies the E. coli complement target sequence and initiates a double strand break. One crucial aspect is that the target gene must be in close proximity upstream of the PAM sequence. Fortunately, the PAM NGG sequence occurs at 424,651 instances on both strands of the E. coli chromosome, so this method is not limited in its targeted specificity.|$|E
2500|$|Cultures {{typically}} become {{positive in}} 24 to 48 hours (this rapid growth rate differentiates the organism from B. mallei, which typically takes {{a minimum of}} 72 hours to grow). Colonies are wrinkled, have a metallic appearance, and possess an earthy odour. [...] On Gram staining, the organism is a Gram-negative rod with a characteristic [...] "safety pin" [...] appearance (bipolar staining). [...] On sensitivity testing, the organism appears highly resistant (it is innately resistant to {{a large number of}} antibiotics including colistin and gentamicin) and that again differentiates it from B. mallei, which is in contrast, exquisitely sensitive to a large number of antibiotics. [...] For environmental specimens only, differentiation from the nonpathogenic B. thailandensis using an <b>arabinose</b> test is necessary (B. thailandensis is never isolated from clinical specimens). The laboratory identification of B. pseudomallei has been described in the literature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{source for}} these {{nutrients}} is {{often found in}} the grape must itself, though MLF inoculations that run concurrent with alcoholic fermentation risk the yeast outcompeting the bacteria for these nutrients. Towards the end of fermentation, {{while most of the}} original grape must resources have been consumed, the lysis of dead yeast cells (the [...] "lees") can be a source for some nutrients, particularly amino acids. Plus, even [...] "dry" [...] wines that have been fermented to dryness still have unfermentable pentose sugars (such as <b>arabinose,</b> ribose and xylose) left behind that can be used by both positive and spoilage bacteria. As with wine yeast, manufacturers of cultured LAB inoculum usually offer specially prepared nutritional additives that be used as a supplement. However, unlike wine yeast, lactic acid bacteria can not use the supplement diammonium phosphate as a nitrogen source.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, <b>arabinose,</b> galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax [...] "recalcitrant" [...] cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of [...] "mechanochemistry" [...] has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E
50|$|When <b>arabinose</b> is present, <b>arabinose</b> binds AraC and {{prevents}} AraC from interacting. This breaks the DNA loop. The two AraC-arabinose complexesbind to the araI1 and araI2 sites which promotes transcription. When <b>arabinose</b> is present, AraC {{acts as an}} activator.|$|E
5000|$|Originally commercialized as a sweetener, <b>arabinose</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of sucrase, {{the enzyme}} that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose {{in the small}} intestine. [...] This inhibitory effect has been validated both in rodents and humans. [...] Therefore, <b>arabinose</b> {{could be used in}} foods to attenuate the peak of glycemic response (see: glycemic index) after the consumption of sucrose. The long-term effects of <b>arabinose</b> consumption on blood glucose parameters such as HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels are unknown. Foods that contain <b>arabinose</b> are usually designed for prediabetic and diabetic patients. These foods are especially popular in Japan and China, where <b>arabinose</b> is legally used as a food additive.|$|E
50|$|The L-arabinose operon, {{also known}} as the araBAD operon, {{has been the subject of}} much biomolecular research. The operon directs the {{catabolism}} of <b>arabinose</b> in E. coli, and it is dynamically activated in the presence of <b>arabinose</b> and the absence of glucose.|$|E
50|$|In the ara operon, <b>arabinose</b> is the inducer.|$|E
50|$|If <b>arabinose</b> is present, {{it builds}} a complex: AraC + arabinoseThis complex {{is needed for}} RNA {{polymerase}} to bind to the promoter and transcribe the ara operon.Also for activation the binding of another structure to araI is needed: CRP (formerly known as CAP) + cyclic AMPSo the activation depends {{on the presence of}} <b>arabinose</b> and cAMP.|$|E
5000|$|Ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase {{is found}} on the well studied L-arabinose operon. This operon {{consists}} of eight genes araA-araH with the gene for Ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase called araD. The <b>arabinose</b> system enables the take up the pentose L-arabinose, and then the conversion of intracellular <b>arabinose</b> in three steps catalyzed by {{the products of the}} araB, araA, araD genes to D-xylulose-5-phosphate.|$|E

50|$|In E. coli, <b>arabinose</b> is {{converted}} to xylulose 5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arabinose</b> is an {{aldopentose}} - a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms, {{and including}} an aldehyde (CHO) functional group.|$|E
50|$|Deoxyribose, or more {{precisely}} 2-deoxyribose, is a monosaccharide with idealized formula H−(C=O)−(CH2)−(CHOH)3−H. Its name indicates {{that it is a}} deoxy sugar, meaning that it is derived from the sugar ribose by loss of an oxygen atom. Since the pentose sugars <b>arabinose</b> and ribose only differ by the stereochemistry at C2′, 2-deoxyribose and 2-deoxyarabinose are equivalent, although the latter term is rarely used because ribose, not <b>arabinose,</b> is the precursor to deoxyribose.|$|E

50|$|Several {{scientists}} have determined {{the composition of}} plant root mucilage using monosaccharide analysis and linkage analysis, showing that Maize (Zea mays) root mucilage contains high levels of galactose, xylose, <b>arabinose,</b> rhamnose, and glucose, {{and lower levels of}} uronic acid, mannose, fucose, and glucuronic acid. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) root mucilage also contains high levels of xylose, <b>arabinose,</b> galactose, glucose, and lower levels of rhamnose, glucuronic acid and mannose. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) also contains high levels of <b>arabinose,</b> galactose, glucose, fucose, and xylose, and lower levels of rhamnose, mannose, and glucuronic acid. Many other plants have had their root mucilage composition determined using monosaccharide analysis and monosaccharide linkage analysis. With the following monosaccharides determined as well as their linkages, {{scientists have}} determined the presence of pectin, arabinogalactan proteins, xyloglucan, arabinan, and xylan, which are plant-specific polysaccharides within the root mucilage of plants.|$|E
5000|$|Transcription {{initiation}} at the PBAD promoter {{occurs in}} the presence of high <b>arabinose</b> and low glucose concentrations. Upon <b>arabinose</b> binding to AraC, the N-terminal arm of AraC is released from its DNA binding domain via a “light switch” mechanism. This allows AraC to dimerize and bind the I1 and I2 operators. The AraC-arabinose dimer at this site contributes to activation of the PBAD promoter. Additionally, CAP binds to two CAP binding sites upstream of the I1 and I2 operators and helps activate the PBAD promoter. In the presence of both high <b>arabinose</b> and high glucose concentrations however, low cAMP levels prevent CAP from activating the PBAD promoter. [...] It is hypothesized that PBAD promoter activation by CAP and AraC is mediated through contacts between the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNA polymerase and the CAP and AraC proteins.|$|E
