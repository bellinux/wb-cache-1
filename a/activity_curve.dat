40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) allows quantitative functional imaging of physiological parameters in terms, for instance, of receptor binding, fractional metabolic uptake, volume of distribution, and blood flow. In fact, the radioactivity concentration measured with PET {{can be related}} to the underlying physiological processes using appropriate tracer kinetic modelling techniques. This chapter presents a review of the basic methods for quantitative PET, including the most used compartmental models, as well as the graphical methods of Patlak and Logan, and the single-input/single-output model called spectral analysis. The physiological information can be computed for the time <b>activity</b> <b>curve</b> of an anatomical region of interest (ROI) or for the time <b>activity</b> <b>curve</b> of every voxel, the latter approach resulting in images of parameter estimates called parametric maps...|$|E
