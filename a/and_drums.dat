Heinrich departed from Decapitated after the recording in order to concentrate on Vesania, and Carnival Is Forever was released on July 12, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The girls {{found the}} school's {{distinctive}} Beret difficult to wear, {{so it was}} phased out in 1995. It {{was replaced by the}} current Panama hat, but the Beret was reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the Pipes <b>and</b> <b>Drums</b> uniform.|$|E

5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar <b>and</b> <b>drums)</b> are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E
5|$|Bowie shelved his solo {{career in}} 1989, {{retreating}} {{to the relative}} anonymity of band membership {{for the first time}} since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass <b>and</b> <b>drums</b> respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust For Life.|$|E

5|$|Cheap at Half the Price was {{recorded}} by Frith {{at his home}} in New York City on a 4-track machine. He played all the instruments himself, with the exception of bass guitar on two tracks, <b>and</b> <b>drums,</b> for which he used tapes and samples previously recorded by other drummers. The record differed from Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted largely of pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards <b>and</b> <b>drums,</b> who played skiffle.|$|E
5|$|Like most of McLachlan's albums, Surfacing was {{recorded}} at Marchand's Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Marchand, who produced, engineered and mixed the album, recorded {{it on an}} Otari RADAR recorder and a Neumann 149 microphone. McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass and a drum machine {{as well as providing}} background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, Yves Desrosiers on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar and slide bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion <b>and</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|E

50|$|A fanfare band, fanfare corps, fanfare battery, horn <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> corps, bugle band, <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bugle corps, or trumpet <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> band (including the German fanfarenzug, fanfarenkorps and regimentsblaserkorps, the Dutch tamboerkorps, trompetterkorps and jachthoornkorps, and the French batterie-fanfare and fanfare de cavalerie) is a {{military}} or civilian musical ensemble composed of percussion instruments, bugles, natural horns and natural trumpets (and sometimes even brass instruments). Fanfare bands are {{the descendants of the}} old medieval trumpet <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> teams that sounded fanfares on important occasions and are related to <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bugle corps internationally.|$|R
5|$|Orchestras {{continued}} to use noise {{in the form of}} a percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of timpani. However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, <b>and</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|E
5|$|The eldest {{child in}} a family of three boys and five girls, Zubir Said was born on 22 July 1907 in Bukittinggi (formerly known as Fort De Kock) in the Minangkabau {{highlands}} of West Sumatra, Indonesia. His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, he learned to play the guitar <b>and</b> <b>drums</b> from fellow students and the keroncong group he was involved in.|$|E
5|$|The style {{began in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups {{recording}} on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka, and the psychoacoustic environments recordings of Irv Teibel. In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes <b>and</b> <b>drums,</b> singing bowls, Australian didgeredoos and world music sounds to spiritual chanting from other cultures.|$|E
50|$|Fife <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> blues is an American {{folk music}} form derived from country blues, martial music tradition, and African rhythms. It is {{performed}} typically with one lead fife {{player and a}} troop of drummers. Unlike a drum corps, the drum troop is loosely structured. As such, a fife <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> band may have a variable number of snare, tom, <b>and</b> bass <b>drum</b> players. A large military-style bass drum is preferred. Fife <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> performances are often family affairs held at reunions, summer community picnics, and on holidays.|$|R

5|$|Arjona's primary musical {{style is}} Latin pop. He usually sings {{without the help}} of {{featured}} or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden Déjame Decir Que Te Amo, on the following two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. Animal Nocturno intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, <b>and</b> <b>drums.</b> On Historias, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings. On Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up <b>and</b> <b>drums</b> in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) <b>and</b> <b>drums</b> and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
50|$|Alan Lomax first {{recorded}} black fife <b>and</b> <b>drum</b> music in 1942.
