25|$|Shalhoub {{demonstrated}} his dramatic {{range in}} the 1998 big-budget thriller The Siege, where he co-starred alongside Denzel Washington, <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening,</b> and Bruce Willis. His character, FBI Special Agent Frank Haddad, also a Lebanese American, suffered discrimination after terrorist attacks in New York City. He returned to series television in 1999, this time in a lead role on Stark Raving Mad, opposite Neil Patrick Harris. The show failed to attract an audience and NBC cancelled the series in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Susan Sarandon was {{originally}} set to play Barbara Land before <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> was cast. Bening modeled the character after Ann-Margret's performance in Viva Las Vegas (1964). Hugh Grant {{was the first}} choice for Professor Donald Kessler, which eventually went to Pierce Brosnan. Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Stockard Channing were considered for First Lady Marsha Dale, but Glenn Close won the role. In addition to Nicholson, other actors who reunited with Burton on Mars Attacks! include Sylvia Sidney from Beetlejuice (1988), O-Lan Jones from Edward Scissorhands (1990), and Danny DeVito from Batman Returns (1992), continuing Burton's trend of recasting actors several times from his previous works.

500|$|Anthony Pratt and Celia Bobak were {{nominated}} for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as was John Mathieson for Cinematography. However, both categories were awarded to The Aviator.

The song was also {{nominated for the}} Golden Globe but it lost to Alfie's [...] "Old Habits Die Hard". In the same ceremony, Emmy Rossum was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, losing to <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> in Being Julia.

500|$|Hepburn's final {{appearance}} in a theatrically released film, {{and her first}} since Grace Quigley ten years earlier, was Love Affair (1994). At 87 years old, she played a supporting role alongside <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> and Warren Beatty. It was the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo {{appearance in}} Stage Door Canteen, in which she did not play a leading role. Roger Ebert noted {{that it was the}} first time she had looked frail, but that the [...] "magnificent spirit" [...] was still there and said her scenes [...] "steal the show". The New York Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress's final big-screen appearance, stating that [...] "if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been". Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie One Christmas (1994), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old.|$|E
500|$|Moore next starred with <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> in the {{independent}} film The Kids Are All Right (2010), a comedy–drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer–director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film's sexual content. The actress {{was drawn to the}} film's [...] "universal" [...] depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. The Kids Are All Right was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore's performance of Jules, who she called an [...] "existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty", writing, [...] "There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera—sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally... and Moore plays every note perfectly." [...] The Kids Are All Right earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|After a short hiatus {{from acting}} {{following}} {{the birth of}} her two children, Watts returned to acting in 2009, starring alongside Clive Owen in the political thriller The International. She played a Manhattan assistant district attorney who partners with an Interpol agent to take down a merchant bank. The picture was well received by critics, and grossed over US$60million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) worldwide. The same year, she appeared in the drama Mother and Child, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. She portrayed the role of Elizabeth, a lawyer who never knew her biological mother. Watts co-starred the film along with <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening,</b> Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. Mother and Child received mainly favourable reviews, with ViewLondon remarking that Watts [...] "is terrific as Elizabeth, delivering a powerful performance that [...] isn't afraid to be unsympathetic". She was nominated for the Best Actress award at the Australian Film Institute Awards and was also nominated for an Independent Spirit Award in the category of Best Supporting Female.|$|E
500|$|A normal {{woman who}} becomes a {{criminal}} after being almost killed by her boss Max Shreck, who later decides to try everything to kill her. She is held as a femme fatale in {{the most of the}} film. According to Michelle Pfeiffer, who was previously considered to play Vicki Vale in the previous film, she felt devastated after <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> was cast as Catwoman. However, Bening became pregnant, allowing Pfeiffer to get the role. Pfeiffer's $3 million salary was $2 million more than was offered to Bening. To prepare for the role, Pfeiffer attended kickboxing classes and practised handling a whip (during which she accidentally cut her teacher's chin). Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep (who was considered [...] "too old" [...] by Burton), Brooke Shields (who Burton considered [...] "not bankable"), Demi Moore, Nicole Kidman (who ended up playing Dr. Chase Meridian in Batman Forever), Jodie Foster, Geena Davis, Sigourney Weaver, Lena Olin, singer Madonna, Raquel Welch, Cher, Ellen Barkin, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lorraine Bracco, Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Beals were also considered for the role, but they lost out to Pfeiffer.|$|E
500|$|Michael Keaton {{returned}} after {{a significant increase}} in his salary to $10 million. <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> was cast as Catwoman after Burton saw her performance in The Grifters, but she dropped out due to her pregnancy. Raquel Welch, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Madonna, Ellen Barkin, Cher, Bridget Fonda, Lorraine Bracco, Jennifer Beals and Susan Sarandon were then in competition for the role. Sean Young, who was originally chosen for Vicki Vale in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition. Burton was unfamiliar with Michelle Pfeiffer's work, but was convinced to cast her after one meeting. Pfeiffer received a $3 million salary, $2 million more than Bening, and a percentage of the box office. The actress undertook kickboxing lessons for the role. Kathy Long served as Pfeiffer's body double. On Danny DeVito's casting, Waters explained, [...] "I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin. We didn't really officially cast it, but for a short nasty little guy, it's a short list. I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, he {{appeared}} in the independent crime drama Winged Creatures (released as Fragments on DVD) alongside Dakota Fanning as they portrayed two teenage friends who survive a massacre, and in Journey to the Center of the Earth, a 3D film adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} where he portrayed a teen who travels to Iceland with an uncle he hardly knows, played by Brendan Fraser. Over the next two years, {{he appeared}} as a boy named Steve [...] "Leopard" [...] Leonard who visits a freak show with his friends in the vampire fiction [...] of the book Cirque du Freak and had a supporting role in the critically acclaimed The Kids Are All Right, portraying the son of a lesbian couple, played by <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> and Julianne Moore. According to Kaleem Aftab of The Independent, his role in the film was a pivotal point in his career and one of vital importance to continuing his career into adulthood. Hutcherson expressed gratitude at being cast in the film, displaying satisfaction with the intimacy and creative freedom that independent films provide over studio films. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy in 2010, and was a nominee for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards. Gregory Ellwood of entertainment site HitFix stated: [...] "Hutcherson's charismatic wit and natural instincts shine and it's arguably the first film where he proves he's more than just another sharp-looking teen actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite her agency's {{disapproval of}} the film (and fear that the actress might have forever {{tarnished}} her career), she continued on with various projects. Sevigny had a major supporting role as a Manhattanite in Woody Allen's two-sided tragicomedy, Melinda and Melinda (2004), which Sevigny referred to as being a [...] "pleasing" [...] experience. She subsequently guest-starred on the popular television show Will & Grace, {{and a string of}} film roles followed, including a small role in Lars von Trier's sequel to Dogville, titled Manderlay (2005), as well as a bit part alongside Bill Murray in Broken Flowers (2005). Sevigny also played one of several lovers of New York doctor Herman Tarnower in the HBO television film Mrs. Harris (2005) alongside <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> and Ben Kingsley. Sevigny then had a major role as a Catholic nun visiting Africa in one of three stories in 3 Needles (2005), an anthology dealing with the prevalence of AIDS {{in various parts of the}} world. Sevigny's performance in the film was praised; Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance in the film [...] "convincing", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times also referred to Sevigny as [...] "ever-daring and shrewd". Shortly after 3 Needles, Sevigny played the lead character in the experimental indie-film Lying (2006) with Jena Malone and Leelee Sobieski, playing a pathological liar who gathers three female acquaintances for a weekend at her upstate New York country house; the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006. She also had a leading part in Douglas Buck's 2006 remake of the Brian De Palma horror film Sisters (1973).|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{went on to}} host {{a series}} of {{specials}} for CNBC. The network followed up by signing her to host a weekly talk show of politics and culture titled Topic [...] With Tina Brown, which debuted on 4 May 2003. The program welcomed guests ranging from political figures, such as the then Prime Minister of the UK, Tony Blair, and Senator John McCain, to celebrities, such as George Clooney and <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening.</b> Topic A struggled to find an audience on Sunday nights airing {{after a day of}} infomercials. It averaged 75,000 viewers in 2005, about the same as The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch (79,000) and John McEnroe's McEnroe (75,000.) On being offered a lucrative deal with tight deadlines {{to write a book about}} Princess Diana, Brown resigned, airing her last Topic A interviews on 29 May 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan's last film of 2008 was The Women, {{a remake}} of the 1939 production. The all-female cast {{comprises}} <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening,</b> Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Written, produced and directed by Diane English, the film centers {{on a group of}} four female Manhattan socialites whose primary interest is idle gossip, with Ryan portraying a wealthy woman whose husband is cheating on her with a shop girl, played by Eva Mendes. Ryan was the first actress to join the long-delayed production, which struggled to find financing since the early 1990s, resulting in an independent production budgeted at $18million. Upon its release, The Women received a disastrous response from critics, with Richard Schickel of Time calling it [...] "one of the worst movies I've ever seen". The film was a financial success, however, becoming Ryan's most successful film since 2001's Kate & Leopold with a worldwide gross of $50million.|$|E
2500|$|Midler debuted her Vegas show titled [...] at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on February 20, 2008. It {{comprised}} The Staggering Harlettes, 20 female dancers called The Caesar Salad Girls and a 13-piece band. The show played {{its final}} performance on January 31, 2010, and {{was nominated for}} a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special in 2011. Also in 2008, another compilation album by Midler, , was released. It reached number 66 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and number six in the United Kingdom, where it was certified platinum for sales of over 300,000 copies. As her only film appearance that year, Midler had a small role in Diane English's comedy film The Women, starring Meg Ryan, <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> and Eva Mendes among others. An updated version of the George Cukor-directed 1939 film of the same name based on a 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce, the film was widely panned by critics, who found it [...] "...a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, she starred {{opposite}} Kevin Costner in {{the sports}} drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: [...] "It's {{not much of a}} role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice." [...] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: [...] "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled." [...] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: [...] "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption." [...] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card. In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening,</b> Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she [...] "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Loncraine's 1995 filmic {{adaptation}} of Richard Eyre's 1990 stage production of Richard III features considerably less material from 3 Henry VI than had Olivier's film. Starring Ian McKellen as Richard (reprising his role {{from the stage}} production), John Wood as Edward, Nigel Hawthorne as George and <b>Annette</b> <b>Bening</b> as Queen Elizabeth, the film begins prior to the Battle of Tewkesbury, with Henry VI (portrayed by Edward Jewesbury) still in power. The opening scene depicts Henry and his son Edward (played by Christopher Bowen) preparing for the forthcoming battle. However, a surprise attack is launched on their headquarters by Richard, and both are killed. This scene is without dialogue. The last line of 3 Henry VI is also used in the film; Edward's [...] "For here I hope begins our lasting joy" [...] appears as a subtitle after the coronation of Edward and is altered to read [...] "And now, they hope, begins their lasting joy", with [...] "they" [...] referring to the House of York. The film then moves on to the coronation of Edward IV (again without dialogue), before Richard delivers the opening speech of Richard III as an after-dinner toast to the new king. Like Olivier's film, Loncraine includes several characters in the coronation scene who are not present {{in the text of}} 3 Henry VI; Buckingham (played by Jim Broadbent), Richmond (played by Dominic West) and Elizabeth Plantagenet (played by Kate Steavenson-Payne). Richmond will later go on to be Henry VII, and Elizabeth (King Edward's daughter) will become his queen. As with Jane Shore, Elizabeth is mentioned several times in Richard III, although she never appears in the text. Loncraine's film also used a line from 3 Henry VI in its poster campaign – [...] "I can smile and murder whiles I smile" [...] (3.2.182), although [...] "whiles" [...] was changed to [...] "while." [...] This line is also included in the film – after Richard concludes his opening speech to Edward, he enters the men's room and continues in soliloquy form to line twenty-seven of Richard III before then referring back to the earlier play [...] "Why, I can smile and murder while I smile/And wet my cheeks with artificial tears/And frame my face to all occasions" [...] (ll. 182-185). The film then moves on to the arrest of George.|$|E
