5000|$|An <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference,</b> when {{opposed to}} cataphora, refers to {{something}} within a text {{that has been}} previously identified. For example, in [...] "Susan dropped the plate. It shattered loudly" [...] the word [...] "it" [...] refers to the phrase [...] "the plate".|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I will analyse <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references</b> in German texts and their transaltion into Portuguese. I will take as main corpus Heinrich Böll's novel Haus ohne Hüter and its {{translation}} into Portuguese by Jorge Rosa {{with the title}} Casa Indefesa. I will concentrate {{on the use of}} personal pronouns and possessives in references to both people and objects in source text and target text and I will present patterns of symmetries and asymmetries. I will claim that asymmetries in the translation of such <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references</b> can be accounted for mainly by differences in the pronominal systems and verbal systems of both languages and by differences in the way each language marks theme/topic continuity/discontinuity in discourse. Issues related to style and the translation of anaphors will also be addressed. I will finally raise some questions related to ambiguous references which can not be solved within the scope of syntax or semantics, thus requiring pragmatic interpretation based on cultural knowledge/world knowledge...|$|R
50|$|The word nga {{functions}} as a pronoun with specific use. It is a third person pronoun, but lacks specification for number, and is {{used to refer to}} both singular and plural referents. It typically is an <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> to a previously mentioned referent.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{traditional}} analysis, English personal pronouns (e.g. his, her, their) are typically used to refer backward (or forward) within a sentence to a noun phrase (which may be a simple noun). This reference is called an <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference,</b> and the referring pronoun is termed an anaphor.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{framework}} of government and binding theory of syntax, the term null subject refers to an empty category. The empty category in question is thought to behave like an ordinary pronoun with respect to <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> and other grammatical behavior. Hence it is most {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "pro".|$|E
50|$|Coreference {{resolution}} identifies equivalent entities, {{which were}} recognized by NER, within a text. There are two relevant kinds of equivalence relationship. The first one {{relates to the}} relationship between two different represented entities (e.g. IBM Europe and IBM) and the second one {{to the relationship between}} an entity and their <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references</b> (e.g. it and IBM). Both kinds can be recognized by coreference resolution.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss intercultural {{communication}} using the notions of high-context and low-context cultures. Using examples from English and Finnish conversations, we exemplify dialogue strategies and relative speaker and hearer responsibilities via three conversational aspects: <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references,</b> topic introduction, and disjunctive questions. The examples show different interpretations depending on the cultural presuppositions, and we can conclude that the Finnish communication style falls into that typical of high-context cultures. 1...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> {{occurs when}} the writer refers back to someone or {{something}} that has been previously identified, to avoid repetition.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{describes}} an unusual system of <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> tracking in Lavukaleve, a Papuan language of the Solomon Islands. Lavukaleve has two demonstrative pronouns which {{can be used to make}} <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> in narratives. One of these demonstrative pronouns is used to make <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> to a semi-activated participant, and the other to an activated participant. The second part of the paper situates Lavukaleve's activation-based system of reference tracking in a general typology of reference tracking. Other languages which have reference tracking systems based on the cognitive status of the referent are discussed, and the close connection between these and obviation systems is pointed out...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} a {{corpus of}} spoken dialogues to identify {{cases in which}} {{it appears that the}} addressee of an utterance containing an anaphoric pronoun does not have enough evidence to resolve that pronoun. Based on these cases, we propose two conditions under which such 'sloppy' <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references</b> are innocuous. We ran preliminary experiments indicating that subjects find anaphoric pronouns occurring in ambiguous contexts fulfilling these conditions significantly easier to process than pronouns occurring in minimally different contexts in which they are not...|$|R

The system was tested on the corpus of US patents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} and tested a reusable Robot Operating System (ROS) module that supports engagement between a human and a humanoid robot by generating ap-propriate directed gaze, mutual facial gaze, adjacency pair and backchannel connection events. The module implements policies for adding gaze and pointing gestures to referring phrases (including deictic and <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references),</b> performing end-of-turn gazes, responding to human-initiated connection events and maintaining engagement.

30|$|Co-reference {{resolution}} The coreference or <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference</b> {{resolution is}} {{the replacement of}} anaphoric references with their corresponding antecedent. For example, the text: “By use of Glucophage I felt stomach pain. It’s severe and also my ankles are swelling badly.” Contains <b>anaphoric</b> <b>reference.</b> After anaphora resolution, we g,” “By use of Glucophage I felt stomach pain. <Stomach pain> is severe and also my ankles are swelling badly”. We used JavaRAP (Qiu et al. 2004) for coreference resolution, which replaces anaphoric references with their corresponding antecedent and thus anaphora free text is obtained.|$|E

40|$|Anaphora {{resolution}} for dialogues is {{a difficult}} problem because of the several kinds of complex <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references</b> generally present in dialogic discourses. It is nevertheless a critical {{first step in the}} processing of any such discourse. In this paper, we describe a system for anaphora resolution in multi-person dialogues. This system aims to bring together a wide array syntactic, semantic and world knowledge based techniques used for anaphora resolution. In this system, the performance of the heuristics is optimized for specific dialogues using genetic algorithms, which relieves the programmer of hand-crafting the weights of these heuristics. In our system, we propose a new technique based on the use of anaphora chains to enable resolution of a large variety of anaphors, including plural anaphora and cataphora. ...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{automatic}} generation of referring expressions has extended algorithms for {{the generation of}} full definite NPs to deal with <b>anaphoric</b> <b>references.</b> However, there has been relatively little work on the specific problems raised by plural anaphora. In particular, since plurals involve {{a reference to a}} set rather than an individual, one of the interesting questions concerns the extent to which elements of the set introduced by a plurality are salient, as compared to the plurality itself. This paper offers a preliminary exploration of these questions through a study of a small, richly annotated corpus. We discuss the implications of some of the findings for automatic referring expression generation, and also identify some fruitful avenues for future work. peer-reviewe...|$|R
