25|$|As {{they entered}} their {{game against the}} Marion Military Institute, many of the Alabama {{supporters}} viewed the game against the Cadets as just a practice game before their anticipated match-up against Sewanee. On <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Alabama defeated the Cadets 61–0 at Tuscaloosa for their fourth consecutive shutout to open the season. Touchdowns in the game were scored three times by J. H. Emmett, twice each by Charles Bartlett and Mullie Lenoir, and one apiece by Walter E. Hovater and Morgan. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Marion to 6–0.|$|E
25|$|A mistake, however, {{prevented}} {{the move to}} the club: when the contract had been agreed, Dalglish realised {{they did not have}} the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and the office had been locked up for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on the Saturday and signed for Manchester United for £3.75million, a British transfer record at the time.|$|E

25|$|In {{their only}} home {{game of the}} season, the Baby Tide ran for 359 yards and six touchdowns {{en route to a}} 41–7 win over Vanderbilt on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The next week, Alabama rallied from a 15-point deficit and {{defeated}} Tulane 23–22 at New Orleans. After Danny Ridgeway gave the Baby Tide an early 7–0 lead, Tulane responded with the next 22 points and opened a 22–7 lead. Green Wave points were scored on a 43-yard Steve Foley touchdown pass to Robert Johnson, a one-yard Foley touchdown run, a 50-yard John Washington punt return and on a 31-yard David Falgue field goal. Alabama then rallied for the 23–22 victory behind a pair of Bob Holmes touchdown runs and a pair of Ralph Stokes two-point conversions in the fourth quarter.|$|E
500|$|For many years, Lutz {{attracted}} {{a mixture of}} working-class men and Reed College students. The Portland Mercury said the bar served [...] "cheap swill to blue-collar folks and Reed kids that didn't mind walking those extra few blocks." [...] Barisich recalled that [...] "at one time, it was a favorite of concrete workers, city crews and the like. You couldn't keep the floor clean on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Every muddy workboot in the city was here." [...] It served beer only, accepted cash only, and offered the [...] "bare minimum of food that the OLCC required".|$|E
500|$|During {{filming of}} the pilot episode, Whedon was still arguing with Fox that the show should be {{displayed}} in widescreen format. Consequently, he purposely filmed scenes with actors on the extreme edge of both sides {{so that they could}} only be shown in widescreen. This led to a few scenes on the DVD (and later Blu-ray) where objects or setups that were not visible in the original 4:3 broadcasts were now displayed—such as the scene in the pilot where Wash mimes controlling the ship with a non-existent yoke. However, the pilot was rejected by the Fox executives, who felt that it lacked action and that the captain was too [...] "dour". They also disliked a scene in which the crew backed down to a crime boss, since the scene implied the crew was [...] "being nothing". Thus, Fox told Whedon on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> that he had to submit a new pilot script on Monday morning or the show would not be picked up. Whedon and Tim Minear closeted themselves for the weekend to write what became the new pilot, [...] "The Train Job". At the direction of Fox, they added [...] "larger than life" [...] characters such as the henchman [...] "Crow", and the [...] "hands of blue" [...] men, who also introduced an X-Files-type ending.|$|E

60|$|We {{will now}} follow its {{fortunes}} {{for a short}} while, and explain how it was that Mary received no answer for a week; a week, {{it may well be}} imagined, of terrible suspense to her. When she took it to the post-office, she doubtless thought that the baker's wife had nothing to do but to send it up to the house at Greshamsbury, and that Frank would receive it that evening, or, at latest, early on the following morning. But this was by no means so. The epistle was posted on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and it behoved the baker's wife to send it into Silverbridge--Silverbridge being the post-town--so that all due formalities, as ordered by the Queen's Government, might there be perfected. Now, unfortunately, the post-boy had taken his departure before Mary reached the shop, and it was not, therefore, dispatched till Saturday. Sunday was always a dies non with the Greshamsbury Mercury, and, consequently, Frank's letter was not delivered at the house till Monday morning; at which time Mary had for two long days been waiting with weary heart for the expected answer.|$|E

40|$|Workflow, loosely defined, is {{the set of}} tasks—grouped {{chronologically}} into processes—and the set {{of people}} or resources needed for those tasks, {{that are necessary to}} accomplish a given goal. An organization’s workflow is comprised of the set of processes it needs to accomplish, the set of people or other resources available to perform those processes, and the interactions among them. Consider the following scenario: On <b>a</b> slow <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> in the emergency room, as one nurse prepares to go off shift, the clerk looks up from the desk and asks, “By the way, since you’re passing by housekeeping on your way out, would you remind them that room 12 still needs to be cleaned?” “No problem, ” replies the nurse, and indeed, on <b>a</b> slow <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> it is no problem. The informal methods and processes that the hospital has developed over the years to keep the enterprise humming work well, in general, and can work very well in optimal times. It’s no trouble to remind housekeeping to come up; it’s no trouble to run a special specimen down to the lab, and certainly no trouble to catch the attending physician during rounds to get a quick signature...|$|R
