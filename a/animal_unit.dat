25|$|While the BLM rates horses by <b>animal</b> <b>unit</b> (AUM) to eat {{the same}} amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round is not good for the range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E

50|$|This {{simple method}} is {{sometimes}} used for cattle. The number of <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> represented {{by one or}} more head of cattle may be calculated by dividing their total body mass in kg by 454 (or dividing their weight in pounds by 1000).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} optimum size of rangeland properties, range management units within Margha River area, Izeh, were selected and rangeland parts were separated from other types of land use as the study area. Different ecological and socio-economic criteria were used for calculations. Ecological criteria were adopted from range management plans, including forage production, grazing capacity and rangeland condition and trend. Socio-economic criteria were studied conducting a questionnaire-based survey by 62 questionnaires. Also some data about consumptive costs of households {{were obtained from the}} data center of Iran Statistics Center. Relative poverty line was calculated in two situations with /without considering the costs and revenues outside the rangeland. Ignoring the costs and incomes related to non-rangeland sources resulted in the optimal size of utilization units to be 146 <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> of sheep or 186 <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> of goats or 62 and 106 <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> of sheep and goats, respectively. Considering all the costs and incomes resulted in the optimal units to be 140 <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> of sheep or 178 goats or 70 and 89 <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> of sheep and goats, respectively. These results could be utilized for range management plans and policies within similar areas...|$|R

5000|$|In this method, {{which has}} been {{suggested}} for cattle, the number of <b>animal</b> <b>units</b> represented by an animal can be calculated as the ratio of that individual's body mass (in kg) to the 0.75 power, divided by 454 to the 0.75 power.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of animal abuse {{continues to rise}} in communities across this nation. The range of animal abuse crimes includes starvation and neglect, dog fighting, sexual abuse to malicious killing. Research indicates that crime against or involving animals often leads to crime against humans, interpersonal violence. Many animal abuse crimes go unreported, and the human victims involved are unidentified. Overburdened with crimes against humans, many police departments {{do not have the}} resources available to focus on animal abuse. To address this issue, <b>animal</b> crimes <b>units</b> are being initiated in police departments in some major cities. The purpose ofthis research study is to determine if the development of an <b>animal</b> crimes <b>unit</b> would be beneficial to the community to break the cycle of violence that often starts with crimes against or involving animals.

50|$|The {{concept of}} an <b>animal</b> <b>unit</b> (AU) has {{traditionally}} been used in North America to facilitate planning, analysis and administration of forage use by grazing livestock, but the term has also had other applications (in relation to odor control regulation, feedlot size, manure management, etc.).

Consequently, when using or interpreting the term, care is needed {{to ensure that a}} definition appropriate for the purpose is being used.
