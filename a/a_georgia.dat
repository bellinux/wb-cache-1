5|$|After Van Leer's death, Paul Weber {{served as}} acting {{president}} from January 1956 to August 1957, while {{still holding the}} title of Dean of Faculties; {{it was difficult to}} find a permanent replacement due to discriminatory state laws and the looming issue of integration, along with a salary gap between Georgia Tech and comparable institutions. Weber's short tenure as acting president saw significantly increased enrollment standards, efforts by the Georgia Tech Foundation to increase faculty salaries, and further campus expansion including the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, which was completed and dedicated on October 27, 1956. Weber left larger organizational changes and integration for his eventual successor. After the selection of a replacement in the University of Toledo's Dean of Engineering, Edwin D.

5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} success than either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by <b>a</b> <b>Georgia</b> onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E

Alabama responded on their next possession with a four-play, 77-yard drive that was capped by a 10-yard T. J.
