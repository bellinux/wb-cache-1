Due to the greater variety and increased complexity of much state-of-the-art hardware and software, the cost and cycle time for development and startup of a modern engineering laboratory can be excessive.

30|$|The {{use of a}} transition-sensitive {{approach}} has both design challenges as well as performance concerns during simulation. The first {{concern is that the}} construction of these tables is time-consuming. Unfortunately, the size of this table grows exponentially with the size of the inputs. The table construction problem can be addressed by partitioning and clustering mechanisms. The second concern is the performance cost of the table lookup for each component access in a cycle. In order to overcome this cost, simulators such as SoftWatt [17] and Wattch [18] utilize a simple fixed-activity model for the functional <b>unit.</b> These <b>simulators</b> only track the number of accesses to a specific component and utilize an average capacity value to estimate the power consumed. Even the same simulator can employ different types of power models for different components. For example, SimplePower estimates the power consumed in the memories utilizing analytical models [19]. In contrast to the datapath components that utilize a transition-sensitive approach, these models estimate the power consumed per access and do not accommodate the power differences found in sequences of accesses. One of the most widely used microarchitectural power simulators is Wattch [18]. Wattch is a power simulator for superscalar, out-of-order, processors. It has been developed with aid of the infrastructure offered by SimpleScaler [20]. The power estimation engine of Wattch is based on the SimpleScaler architecture, but in addition, it supports detailed cycle-accurate information for all models, including datapath elements, memory, control logic, and clock distribution network [21].|$|R
