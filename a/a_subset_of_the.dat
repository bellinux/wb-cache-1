Morgan sees that historical discussion as <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies. Nuptial flight begins in spring, with males mating {{with one or two}} females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. However, they can also be beneficial to humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum.

5|$|L.A. Noire {{is notable}} for using Depth Analysis's newly {{developed}} technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology {{is central to}} the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly five million copies combined. L.A.

5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production {{of artistic objects}} and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None {{of the founding fathers}} of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform {{than that of a}} pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (<b>a</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
