Landa details one of these rituals, destined for making young boys and girls marriable (caput sihil 'second birth'). The Yucatec Maya {{continue}} the ritual (hetz mek) which marks a child's movement from cradling or carrying to the mother's hip. It is performed at about three months and has godparents of the ceremony. The child is offered implements appropriate to its gender, tools for boys and cloth or thread for girls. If the children grasp them, this is considered a foretelling. <b>All</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> offered pencils and paper.|$|E

He is the patron of the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, the successor organisation of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In this role he presents the annual South African Reconciliation Award. In 2006, Tutu launched a global campaign, organised by Plan, to ensure that <b>all</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> registered at birth, as an unregistered child did not officially exist and was vulnerable to traffickers and during disasters.

25|$|The Lagos State Government {{operates}} state schools. The {{education system}} is the 6-3-3-4 system, which is practised throughout the country (as well as by many {{other members of the}} Economic Community of West African States). The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. <b>All</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamnu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.|$|E
25|$|Many synagogues, schools, {{charities}} and social groups {{care for the}} environment. A majority of Jews living in Antwerp are multilingual and communicate {{in a variety of}} languages. Yiddish, French, Hebrew, English and German are all widely spoken among members of the community, as well as Dutch. The Jewish community of Antwerp did not immediately adopt the locally spoken Dutch language as their common spoken language. Instead, in line with the people they worked with in the diamond trade, they spoke French, the language of commerce in Antwerp until after World War II. In recent years English has taken over as the common language of choice, while stricter enforcement of local language regulations ensure that <b>all</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> fluent in Dutch. The use of language in Antwerp's Jewish community is a complex issue: while community members possess fair knowledge of different languages, {{there is a lack of}} uniformity when it comes to effective communication and discussion in a common language.|$|E

500|$|In Malawi, primary {{education}} is compulsory (Revised Education Act 2012). In 1994, free {{primary education}} for all children was established by the government, which increased attendance rates. Dropout rates are higher for girls than boys, attributed to security problems during the long travel to school, as girls face a higher prevalence of gender-based violence. However, attendance rates for <b>all</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> improving, with enrollment rates for primary schools increased from 58% in 1992 to 75% in 2007, {{while the number of}} students who begin in standard one and complete standard five has increased from 64% in 1992 to 86% in 2006. However attendance in secondary school falls to approximately 25%, with attendance rates being slightly higher for males. [...] Youth literacy has also increased, moving from 68% in 2000 to 82% in 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to improved learning materials in schools, better infrastructure and feeding programs that have been implemented throughout the school system.|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after <b>all,</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E

2500|$|The Victorian era {{is famous}} for the Victorian {{standards}} of personal morality. [...] Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards (and usually followed them), but have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births. [...] However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low—under 5%—for the working class and the poor. By contrast in 21st century Britain, nearly half of <b>all</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> born outside marriage, and nine in ten newlyweds have been cohabitating.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the age of}} one, {{children}} can be admitted to pre-school (...)

The vast majority of schools in Sweden are municipally run, {{but there are also}} autonomous and publicly funded schools, known as [...] "independent schools".

6000|$|George Sand, {{speaking}} of Rousseau's [...] "Confessions," [...] says that an autobiographer always makes himself {{the hero of}} his own novel, and cannot help idealizing, even if he would. But the weak point of all sentimentalists is that they always have been, and always continue under every conceivable circumstance to be, their own ideals, whether they are writing their own lives or no. Rousseau opens his book with the statement: [...] "I am not made like any of those I have seen; I venture to believe myself unlike any that exists. If I am not worth more, at least I am different." [...] O exquisite cunning of self-flattery! It is this very imagined difference that makes us worth more in our own foolish sight. For while all men are apt to think, or to persuade themselves that they think, all other men their accomplices in vice or weakness, they are not difficult of belief that they are singular in any quality or talent on which they hug themselves. More than this; people who are truly original are the last to find it out, for the moment we become conscious of a virtue it has left us or {{is getting ready to}} go. Originality does not consist in a fidgety assertion of selfhood, but in the faculty of getting rid of it altogether, that the truer genius of the man, which commerces with universal nature and with other souls through a common sympathy with that, may take all his powers wholly to itself,--and the truly original man could no more be jealous of his peculiar gift, than the grass could take credit to itself for being green. What is the reason that <b>all</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> geniuses, (though they contrive so soon to outgrow that dangerous quality,) except that they never cross-examine themselves on the subject? The moment that process begins, their speech loses its gift of unexpectedness, and they become as tediously impertinent as the rest of us.|$|E
