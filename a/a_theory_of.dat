5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: {{it does not include}} the effects of quantum physics. The quest for a quantum version of general relativity addresses one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime singularities. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such singularities must exist within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E

5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} <b>A</b> <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} <b>A</b> <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> Justice.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{of a middle}} course between interpretative legal formalism and interpretative legal scepticism {{is one of the}} main characteristics of the contemporary debate on legal interpretation.
