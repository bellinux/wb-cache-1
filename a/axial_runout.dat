30|$|Micro milling is a {{flexible}} and economical method to fabricate micro components with three-dimensional geometry features {{over a wide}} range of engineering materials. But the surface roughness and micro topography always limit the performance of the machined micro components. This paper presents a surface generation simulation in micro end milling considering both axial and radial tool runout. Firstly, a surface generation model is established based on the geometry of micro milling cutter. Secondly, the influence of the runout in axial and radial directions on the surface generation are investigated and the surface roughness prediction is realized. It is found that the <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> has a significant influence on the surface topography generation. Furthermore, the influence of <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> on the surface micro topography was studied quantitatively, and a critical <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> is given for variable feed per tooth to generate specific surface topography. Finally, the proposed model is validated by means of experiments and a good correlation is obtained. The proposed surface generation model offers a basis for designing and optimizing surface parameters of functional machined surfaces.|$|E

Three typical surface topography generation cases of the machined surface in micro milling are presented by considering tool runout, and the emergence conditions for each surface generation cases are investigated quantitatively.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{deformation of}} the outer diameter of a shaft due to the hub press-fitting and disk clamping processes associated with a 2. 5 ″ hard disk drive. We propose a new robust shaft design to minimize the effect of deformation on the outer diameter of the shaft. We numerically show the effect of deformation on the shaft due to the pressure, stiffness, and damping coefficients of fluid dynamic bearings (FDBs), and the critical mass and excitation response of the rotor-bearing system. We also experimentally measured the <b>axial</b> non-repeatable <b>runout</b> and the amplitude at the half speed whirl frequency of FDBs with both conventional and proposed designs. Through these tests we confirm that the proposed design improves the static and dynamic performance of the FDBs and rotor-bearing system.

30|$|It can {{be found}} {{that in this case}} a slight <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> (r_axial > f_z^ 2 / 2 r_ε) will cause the {{emergence}} of single-tooth cutting, which increases surface roughness significantly, i.e., almost 4 times larger than the ideal roughness as shown in Eq. (2). Considering that the magnitude of inevitable <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> is comparable to feed per tooth, in this case the ideal roughness as shown in Figure  3 (a) is difficult to achieve. This explains the reason why in micro milling actual surface roughness deviates substantially from theoretical surface roughness in most of the machining system and merely reducing feedrate cannot improve surface roughness.|$|E
30|$|From the {{judgment}} map as Figure  9, {{it can be}} found that for <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> of 1  μm, when the feed per tooth less than 24  μm per tooth, the machined surface generation falls into the third case; and when the feed per tooth larger than 24  μm per tooth, the machined surface generation falls into the second case.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} uncertainty evaluation for axi-symmetric measurement machines which is compliant with GUM and PUMA methodologies. Specialized measuring machines for the inspection of axisymmetric components enable the measurement of properties such as roundness (radial runout), <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> and coning. These machines typically consist of a rotary table {{and a number of}} contact measurement probes located on slideways. Sources of uncertainty include the probe calibration process, probe repeatability, probe alignment, geometric errors in the rotary table, the dimensional stability of the structure holding the probes and form errors in the reference hemisphere which is used to calibrate the system. The generic method is described and an evaluation of an industrial machine is described as a worked example. Type A uncertainties were obtained from a repeatability study of the probe calibration process, a repeatability study of the actual measurement process, a system stability test and an elastic deformation test. Type B uncertainties were obtained from calibration certificates and estimates. Expanded uncertainties, at 95 % confidence, were then calculated for the measurement of; radial runout (1. 2 µm with a plunger probe or 1. 7 µm with a lever probe); <b>axial</b> <b>runout</b> (1. 2 µm with a plunger probe or 1. 5 µm with a lever probe); and coning/swash (0. 44 arc seconds with a plunger probe or 0. 60 arc seconds with a lever probe) ...|$|E
40|$|LiDAR {{data were}} used to {{quantify}} and analyse a rockfall event which occurred in 2003 in the Western Dolomites (Italian Alps). In addition to previously existing Airborne Laserscanning (ALS) data, high resolution Terrestrial Laserscanning (TLS) data were collected. By using the original point clouds, the volume, <b>axial</b> ratio and <b>runout</b> length of single boulders {{as well as the}} surface roughness in the runout zone of the rockfall were derived. The total volume of the rockfall event of approximately 10, 000 [*]m³ was estimated by a reconstruction of the pre-event surface at the detachment zone. The analysis of the laser scanning data of the accumulation zone revealed a power law scaling for boulder volumes larger than 8 [*]m³. The dependence of runout length on boulder volume is complex; it is moderated by particle sphericity. In addition, we used ALS and TLS data to derive the spatial distribution of surface roughness on the talus cone. TLS allow for more accurate roughness mapping than ALS data, but for most applications the point density of ALS data seems to be sufficiently high to derive measures of roughness. Different sampling approaches for plane fitting on the scale of 5 [*]m did not show significant effects besides the computational time. The results of our analyses provide important perspectives for rockfall modelling and process understanding with potential applications in both ‘applied’ (natural hazards) and ‘pure’ geomorphological research...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 132 Two similar large steam {{turbines}} in an ethylene plant are profiled. One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, disks, seals, and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize <b>axial</b> disk <b>runout</b> and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end journal diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor. Both turbines are now operating very smoothly at the capacity of the production facility...|$|R

Acceptable leakage rates and operation without rubbing contact was predicted for engine conditions that included sealed pressures to 500 psi, sliding speeds to 600 ft/sec, and sealed gas temperatures to 1200 F. In the experimental evaluation, measured gas leakage rates were, in general, close to that predicted and sometimes lower.
