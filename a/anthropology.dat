5|$|Once {{undergraduate}} education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical <b>anthropology</b> and have completed coursework in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking {{to pursue a}} forensic <b>anthropology</b> profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists. Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic <b>anthropology</b> society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic <b>Anthropology</b> Society of Europe or the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic <b>Anthropology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Social <b>anthropology</b> is {{the branch}} of <b>anthropology</b> that studies how {{contemporary}} living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social <b>anthropology,</b> like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social <b>anthropology</b> has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

5|$|The use of <b>anthropology</b> in the {{forensic}} investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition of <b>anthropology</b> as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical <b>anthropology.</b> The field of <b>anthropology</b> began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical <b>anthropology</b> and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical <b>anthropology</b> during the early 20th century. In addition to physical <b>anthropology,</b> Hooton was a proponent of criminal <b>anthropology.</b> Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal <b>anthropology</b> to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist {{in the investigation of}} war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible. Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide. Organizations such as the Forensic <b>Anthropology</b> Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic <b>Anthropology,</b> and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic <b>anthropology</b> and the development of standards within the discipline.|$|E

5|$|The professionalization of {{the field}} began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the {{replacement}} of coroners with medical examiners in many locations around the country. It was during this time that the field of forensic <b>anthropology</b> gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the first forensic <b>anthropology</b> research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass. Public attention and interest in forensic <b>anthropology</b> began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases.

It suggests that not-animal <b>anthropologies</b> exhibit poor theological methodology, are based on inaccurate depictions of both humans and other animals, and result in problematic construals {{of what it means to}} be human. Instead, the article concludes, we require theological <b>anthropologies</b> that take as a starting point the relationship between humanity and God and recognise the animal and creaturely context of human existence...|$|R

5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600 anthropoid skulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons. Todd's contributions to the field of <b>anthropology</b> remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of <b>anthropology,</b> {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic <b>anthropology</b> gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E
