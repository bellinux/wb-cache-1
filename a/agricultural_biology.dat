50|$|There is a {{high level}} of {{competition}} for admission to veterinary schools; there are currently only twenty eight veterinary schools in the United States which meet the accreditation standards set by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and five in Canada. Entrance requirements vary among veterinary schools, and various pre-professional degree programs have been developed to assist undergraduates in meeting these requirements. Such “pre-vet” programs are thus similar in concept to “pre-med” programs, and are often housed in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Biology,</b> Animal Science, or Biological Science programs.|$|E
50|$|The Faculty of Agriculture {{consists}} of six departments: <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Biology,</b> Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Chemistry, Agricultural Engineering, Animal Sciences and Crop Science. The faculty {{has established a}} Centre for Sustainable Agriculture and Resource Management (CENSARM). The faculty has well-established crop and livestock farms, about 15 acres in extent for teaching purposes and for the issue of seed and planting materials and breeding stock of farm animals to the public. Arrangements are being made to expand these activities in another 10-acre farm taken over from the Research Training and Farm Complex of the Department of Agriculture at Karadianaru. Equipment and laboratory facilities for teaching and research are available in each Department of study.|$|E
50|$|The {{collection}} and cultivation of {{endangered plant species}} is considered as a main task of the garden (there are 400 endangered plant species in Armenia). Of particular interest here are Taxus baccata, Hedera helix, Juniperus sabina, Zelkova carpinifolia, Rhododendron caucasicum. Another goal is the environmental education. Scientists around the botanical garden in the past had always appeared {{in the media and}} wrote articles about the problems of environmental protection in Armenia. They also offer advice on educational institutions, industry and private plant seeders. Field trips for school children are carried out constantly, many students in <b>agricultural</b> <b>biology</b> make this their field studies. There have also been previously unexplored irregularities; some bushes and trees grew in certain areas unnaturally fast. A large number of local and introduced plants were tested on their growth conditions and later successfully planted around the Lake Sevan.|$|E
5000|$|The pre-medical {{coursework}} {{is offered}} at many American colleges and universities; however, {{it is considered}} to be a [...] "track" [...] that follows a certain curriculum. Most pre-medical students major in the natural and applied sciences, such as <b>agricultural</b> science, <b>biology,</b> chemistry, or physics, though this is not a requirement. Some pre-professional degree programs in agriculture prepare students for direct entry into the workforce in fields in high demand, while also meeting requirements for medical or veterinary schools. [...] The latter curriculum model is meant to enhance employability of graduates awaiting admission or choosing not to attend professional or graduate school.|$|R
500|$|The {{degree program}} {{was the first}} of its kind to {{implement}} a multi-disciplinary approach to farm animal production science. [...] It combined elements of agronomy, biochemistry, physiology, veterinary science, soil and agricultural ecology (<b>agricultural</b> science), <b>biology,</b> economics, social sciences, and animal nutrition and husbandry to teach students how all these elements interacted to create a productive agricultural ecosystem. [...] Graduates from the new program were more generalists than specialists in order to help them find and implement original solutions to varied problems with Australia's livestock production, then still struggling with output and sustainability issues. [...] The impact of the resulting improvements in Australia's livestock production was seen in Australians becoming among the world's biggest per capita meat consumers.|$|R
40|$|The {{statistics}} course most engineers took in college—seldom {{more than}} one—introduced {{them to a}} particular species of statistics, which, regrettably, is of limited use in geotechnical practice: frequentist sampling theory. That species of statistical thinking arose to address problems of <b>agricultural</b> experimentation, <b>biology,</b> and economics. It is mostly applicable to narrow domains in medical trials, political polls, and the like, where carefully planned experiments lead to large databases and p-value tests of hypotheses. These are not the problems facing the geotechnical engineer. He or she faces extremely limited numbers of observations (maybe only one), measurements of differing types and quality, a blend of qualitative and quantitative information, and a need to make sequential decisions as data arrive...|$|R
5000|$|Blandy Experimental Farm Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located adjacent to The Tuleyries at Boyce, Clarke County, Virginia. It encompasses 15 contributing buildings, 1 contributing site, and 1 contributing structure. They include a large, two-story, brick slave's quarters built about 1825; a stone and brick stables that was later converted into a dwelling; a turn-of-the-20th-century farmhouse and its associated agricultural and domestic related outbuildings; a late-19th century vernacularhall-parlor-plan house; two historic dwelling sites; as well as orchards and fields of improved pasture.Graham F. Blandy bequeathed 700 acres of his approximately 900 acre estate to the University of Virginia, which accepted it {{after his death in}} 1926. The University began its program of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biology</b> at Blandy in 1927, and converted part of the landscape into an arboretum, now known as the Orland E. White Research Arboretum. The slaves quarter's, referred to as the Quarters, was converted into laboratories and student and faculty housing. In 1941, the Quarters building was greatly enlarged with the addition of three Colonial Revival wings. This addition created a [...] "U"-shaped building with the original Quarters section as the east wing. A research greenhouse was built at the same time.|$|E
50|$|In 1946-1948 {{he worked}} as a docent for Kharkov University and {{obtained}} his Doktor nauk degree (1947). In August 1948, after the infamous VASKhNIL session there Lysenkoists destroyed scientific genetics Efroimson was stripped from his degree. In 1948 Efroimson writes his report On the Criminal Activities by Trofim Lysenko with an elaborate analysis of activities by influential pseudo-science figure Trofim Lysenko. In 1949 Efroimson was sentenced for his Libel against the Red Army to seven years in Gulag. The formal reason for his arrest was his February 1945 report about the violence against German civilians although the real reason was probably his criticism of Lysenko. In 1956 after freeing from the camps he wrote reports to the Prosecutor General of the USSR On undermining of the agriculture in the Soviet Union and the international authority of Soviet science and On the losses caused by pseudo-innovations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>biology.</b> In 1956-1961 {{he worked as}} a librarian in the Library of Foreign Literature, Moscow (1961); since 1961 he worked for Mechnikov Institute of Vaccines and Serums. In 1962 his doctoral degree was returned to him. In 1965 he received prestigious Mendel medal. In 1968 Efroimson became the head of the Genetics Department of Moscow Institute for Psychiatry. In 1976-1989 he was a consultant for the Institute of Development Biology of the USSR Academy of Sciences.|$|E
40|$|Recognizing {{the vital}} role that a {{herbarium}} plays in instruction, research, and public service, the Cebu State College of Science and Technology College of Agriculture (CSCSTCA) in Lahug, Cebu City, the Philippines, founded a herbarium in June 1987. It {{is a very}} humble scientific project of the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Biology</b> Laboratory of the College, {{and it is the}} second in the entire region, the USC Herbarium being the first (Seidenschwarz, 1990). The 4 year old CSCST-CA Herbarium started with very few specimens collected by the author from Cabra Islet, Lubang Island, Occidental Mindoro, which he had made as part of his M. Sc. degree at the University of the Philippines at Los Baños (UPLB) (see also Buot, 1988).
