40|$|Aim: To explain Q methodology, an untraditional {{approach}} to nursing research, by exploring the various stages {{involved in it}} and using two studies. Background: Q has some <b>of</b> the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative, <b>methodologies.</b> A defining principle of Q is its assumption that subjective viewpoints are amenable to systematic analysis. Q aims to identify shared views across a population. The orientation of the uncovered perspectives differs significantly from qualitative research {{and there is no}} researcher bias. Data Sources: Studies on living with chronic pain and the therapeutic relationship in mental health nursing. Review Methods: A review <b>of</b> the <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages <b>of</b> Q. Discussion: In areas where there are many contradictions and contrasting views, for example nursing practice, such a methodology could bring clarity in identifying subjective views of different groups. This article will first present the methodology followed by two examples of studies that have been carried out. Conclusion: This article demonstrates that Q has much to offer nurse researchers, because the identification of patients' viewpoints in a reliable way has the potential to help nurses to deliver evidence-based practice in response to patients' needs. Implications for Research/Practice: Q methodology has much to offer nursing research because the identification of patients' viewpoints has the potential to enhance nurses' abilities to deliver responsive evidence-based practice...|$|R
40|$|We aim {{to address}} the main {{similarities}} and differences in pregnancy, delivery and postnatal experiences of Portuguese mothers. In order to accomplish this purpose, 8 focus groups were composed, each one with 4 to 6 participants. The sample, {{with a total of}} 35 subjects, is quite heterogeneous regarding several social and demographic characteristics. However, the majority of the mothers had their first (45. 7 %) or the second child (45. 7 %), about six months prior to the study. The focus groups were held in Medical Centres and the mothers were invited to participate by the nurses responsible for the vaccination in those centres. Most mothers agreed to participate. Those sessions occurred in the presence of two researchers and were audio-taped. Some questions were presented for discussion in the group, in order to focus the participants in their pregnancy and postnatal experiences. Mothers contributions were then transcribed and categorised using the IN-VIVO program. The categorisation of themes resulting from mothers participation, as well as some examples of their contributions, which had been categorised in each one of the themes, are presented. Similarities and differences found in pregnancy, delivery and postnatal experiences in this Portuguese sample, along with the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> using a <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodology</b> when conducting a study with this kind of purpose, are discussed. In relation to observations in others countries, results show the great importance {{of the quality of the}} relationship and support from extended family and husband to the happiness of Portuguese women during pregnancy and postpartum; nevertheless the mothers complain of the intrusiveness of the family after delivery. Also, as far as postnatal depression is concerned, and regarding to the causes, almost all the mothers conveyed that overwork and lack of support from husband and from mother might lead to depression after delivery...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a chapter}} from the book, Evaluation of Human Work, {{published}} by CRC Press [© Taylor & Francis Group]. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>methodology</b> is increasingly used to lead and support Ergonomics and Human Factors (E/HF) studies {{in a range}} of contexts. This chapter provides an insight into the practical use <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodology</b> in E/HF and outlines the theory and principles which underpin the use of such methodologies. We present an overview <b>of</b> the main <b>qualitative</b> approaches and provide guidance on undertaking a qualitative project; to support this we describe the use of thematic analysis, including examples of computer-aided analysis, discuss validity, reliability and critical appraisal in relation to research design and analysis and introduce a qualitative data management software package (NVivo). A review of the use <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> in E/HF (Hignett, 2001) found early examples of methodological exploration including Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA, Sanderson and Fisher, 1997 : 1472). ESDA was described as ‘any empirical undertaking seeking to analyse systems, environmental and/or behavioural data (usually recorded) in which the sequential integrity of events has been preserved’ and was used as an umbrella term to group established techniques rather than proposing new ones. Sanderson and Fisher suggested three E/HF traditions supporting the exploration <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> (ESDA) : (1) the behavioural tradition using directly observable laboratory-based experimentation, (2) the cognitive tradition to model indirectly observed or symbolic behaviour, for example in human computer interaction, and (3) the social or naturalistic tradition of social sciences as a more recent development. The use <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> in E/HF has increased considerably since this chapter was first written in 2005, for example in inclusive design (Fisk et al, 2009), participatory ergonomics (Dixon and Theberge, 2011), organisational ergonomics (Berlin, 2011) and workplace analysis (Lundh et al, 2011). This reflects the maturation <b>of</b> the <b>qualitative</b> – quantitative debate and the appreciation of alternative epistemological (ways of knowing) perspectives giving new and critical insights for accepted practices (Symon and Cassell, 2004). One worrying trend has been the use <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> without a clear statement (and understanding) of the underpinning philosophy. Although projects can be carried out to a satisfactory level without reference to the relevant theory (ontology and epistemology) this can lead to problems with the quality of the project. Silverman (2006) views this as a failure in analysis with, for example, an emphasis on the exploration of a problem and very limited testing of the findings (explanation) or proof that contrary evidence has been sought. This will be further discussed in this chapter to set out both a generic process for qualitative projects and mechanisms to ensure that reliability and validity are considered and addressed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– This paper aims {{to offer}} an insight into the {{emergent}} qualitative methodological profile and its distinctive contribution to accounting and management scholarship, particularly reflecting upon the contribution <b>of</b> <b>Qualitative</b> Research in Accounting &# 38; Management (QRAM). Design/methodology/approach– It examines the range <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> employed in the research published across the ten years of QRAM and analyses the methodological discourse and its contribution to the armoury available to qualitative researchers. In association with these methodological developments, the paper offers {{a critique of the}} articulated role of theory in contemporary accounting and management qualitative research. Findings– A wide range <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> are found to be in evidence, with considerable scope for further adoption and development of some. Methodological exposition papers are found to be a significant contribution in the past decade and include methodological framework building, methodological applications, methodological critiques, and methodological development exemplars. Alongside methodology, the dual role of theory as either informing or reflecting methodology is presented. Originality/value– The paper provides a critical analysis and consideration <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> methodological literature development {{in the last ten years}} of accounting and management research literature, particularly reflected in QRAM.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{experience}} of parenting with severe mental illness, using <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies.</b> It is presented in three parts: a literature review, {{a report of the}} empirical research, and a critical reflection of the process undertaken. The literature review provides both a systematic review <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> studies exploring {{the experience of}} parenting with a severe mental illness (SMI), and a meta-synthesis of the findings from the included studies. The findings demonstrated six overarching themes that were central to the parents' experience. The themes were interlinked and often conflictual in nature and a model {{of the relationship between the}} themes is provided. The synthesis revealed how the additional and conflicting pressures faced by parents with SMI can interact with their symptoms to affect parenting behaviours and decisions about engagement with services. The model of themes elicited by the synthesis provides a broad conceptual framework in which parenting with SMI can be considered across the age range of children, parental symptoms and parenting roles. The empirical research provides a specific focus on the views and experiences of parents with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to explore the lived experience of parenting with BD, to provide insight into the parents' perspective and the influence that this may have on outcomes for parents as well as their children. The analysis resulted in six overarching themes, each of which consisted of a number of sub-themes. There were important interactions between the themes and these are illustrated for the reader. It was found that the parents identified a number of challenges in being a parent with BD and experienced feelings of inadequacy, guilt and worry relating to the impact that their illness had on their children and family. Strategies for managing these feelings and limiting the impact of BD could have an inadvertent negative effect on their own well-being, and that of their child. Learning to accept their diagnosis and developing strategies for managing their symptoms were crucial for positive parenting, although the changing needs of their children often presented new challenges. Contextual factors, including the stigma associated with mental illness, could also either mediate or exacerbate the challenge of parenting with BD. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. The critical reflection provides a consideration <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies</b> and a personal reflection on the qualitative process in relation to the empirical research. It details the critical debates around <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodology,</b> the application <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodologies,</b> and the challenges this presented for the researcher. The report was written on completion of the investigation and reflects the process by which, as a novice, the author was able to develop an understanding <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>methodology</b> and carry out an insightful piece of research.
