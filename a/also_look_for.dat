Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals.

Examiners can <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E

25|$|Norrie {{disease and}} other NDP related {{diseases}} are {{diagnosed with the}} combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 85% of affected males. Clinical diagnoses rely on ocular findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> progression of the disease from three months through 8–10 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris atrophy, shallowing of anterior chamber, and shrinking of the globe. By this point, people with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all.|$|E
25|$|Items must be {{collected}} and moved round the screen or {{placed in the}} inventory box to complete cases. Characters will either offer the player objects, or the player must seek out items that can be taken. Collectible items can be kept for later use by dragging the object into the Inventory box. Players must <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> scraps of the Carmen Notes, which describe where each thief will hide. These notes have each been torn into three pieces {{to make them more}} difficult to find. The player must click on the scraps of paper to assemble them into a whole note. Once all the pieces of the Carmen note are found, the ACME handcuffs (known as Time Cuffs) activate and the player can decode Carmen's message to deduce her henchmen's location. Using the Time Cuffs on the relevant object reveals the thief, whom the Good Guide then arrests. After capturing each crook (with Dee Cryption captured once and the others captured twice), the player pursues Carmen herself.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 as Teilifís Éireann {{got ready}} to begin {{broadcasting}} it appointed Hilton Edwards as head of Drama, he was heavily involved in Irish theatre at the time. At this early stage they produced many international and local plays for television audiences such as Antigone, The Wild Duck, The Fire Raisers, The Government Inspector, The Physicists, Martine, The Well of the Saints, Candida, The Man of Destiny, In the Shadow of the Glen, Church Street, The Field, The Plough and the Stars, The Shadow of a Gunman and The Hostage. Both of Edwards' successors Jim Fitzgerald and Chloe Gibson would continue with stage play adaptations but would <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> original dramas for television. Hugh Leonard adapted James Joyce's Dubliners under the title Dublin and in 1966 he wrote Insurrection an 8-part real-time series which depicted {{the events of the}} 1916 Easter Rising which was broadcast on Easter Week on the 50th anniversary of the rising, it was RTÉ biggest drama production of the 1960s, involving on location filming and the Army. In its first ten years on the air RTÉ produced 103 plays of which 66% were Irish and 50% began life as stage plays. Half of the drama produced came from serials such as the Dublin based urban soap Tolka Row which began broadcasting in 1964 and finished in 1968. In terms of population RTÉ was one of Europe's biggest producers of television drama.|$|E

2500|$|Responses to mate guarding, {{specifically}} female {{resistance to}} it, {{have also been}} observed in both humans and other animals. [...] Responses to mate guarding by males has not been extensively studied. Resistance to mate guarding has been suggested to provide some benefits to partners who do so. In animals, particularly crustaceans, {{it is argued that}} resistance allows females {{to reduce the amount of}} time the male guards her, giving her more control over mating, as the benefits of mate guarding by males are not worth the costs of trying to overcome resistance from the female. It is therefore suggested that resistance to mate guarding in animals could be a mate choice strategy for female animals. Seen as mate guarding serves to reduce mate choice, resistance may allow females to ensure they have access to resources from one mate and <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> higher genetic quality extra pair mates to ensure her children are more likely to survive and reproduce themselves. This is known as the female dual mating strategy theory and relates to sexual selection.|$|E

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} in the last section, men and women, when dating, have goals and expectations. They are looking for certain qualities and characteristics. Eventually, both are {{looking for someone to}} spend the rest of their lives with. But in the meantime they are looking for different qualities and characteristics in a person that they wish to have as their immediate companion. According to the study done by Alice Eagly, a professor in Psychology at Northwestern University and Wendy Wood, also a professor in the same department, about sex differences in human behavior, they give the idea that both men and women are looking for certain attractiveness that fits their taste and style. The study states “the value of attractiveness stems from its perceived association with the ability to provide sexual pleasure.” This means that attractiveness suggests information about “sexual warmth” or sexual arousal. The study then proceeds to say that if this is true, then men will seek sexiness in a partner. In addition they will <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> characteristics such as domestic skills. However, Wood and Eagly go on to say “given that the female gender role contains sexual restraint and lacks sexual autonomy, women place less importance on sexiness in a partner.” ...|$|E

60|$|There {{cannot be}} {{a doubt that}} some animals possess an instinctive {{knowledge}} of their enemies--or, at all events, {{of some of their}} enemies--though I do not believe that this faculty is so common as many naturalists imagine. The most striking example I am acquainted with is seen in gnats or mosquitoes, and in the minute South American sandflies (Simulia), when a dragon-fly appears in a place where they are holding their aerial pastimes. The sudden appearance of a ghost among human revellers could not produce a greater panic. I have spoken in the last chapter of periodical storms or waves of dragon-flies in the Plata region, and mentioned incidentally that the appearance of these insects is most welcome in oppressively hot weather, since they are known to come just in advance of a rush of cool wind. In La Plata we <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the dragon-fly, and rejoice at its coming, for another reason. We know that the presence of this noble insect will cause the clouds of stinging gnats and flies, which make life a burden, to vanish like smoke.|$|E
