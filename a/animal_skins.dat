5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} {{parts of the body}} was {{normally}} achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals, plants, and fats. These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry, either in the sun or through smoking. Finally, the deceased was wrapped in <b>animal</b> <b>skins</b> and laid to rest. The number of <b>animal</b> <b>skins</b> used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.|$|E
5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves.

5|$|Hunters of game {{have long}} {{made use of}} {{camouflage}} {{in the form of}} materials such as <b>animal</b> <b>skins,</b> mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals. Field sports such as driven grouse shooting conceal hunters in hides (also called blinds or shooting butts). Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.|$|E

40|$|Moral {{debate over}} vegetarianism forms the {{backdrop}} to a preliminary {{consideration of the}} questions: Is it ethical to produce, sell and eat faux meat? Is it ethical to produce, sell and wear fake <b>animal</b> <b>skin?</b> Is it ethical to sell or wear secondhand or thriftshop genuine <b>animal</b> <b>skin?</b> If vegetarianism is morally required, the question of just what uses of nonhuman animals are ethical or unethical and on what grounds is always on tap. In this piece, I examine the above questions in light of deontological then utilitarian reasons for vegetarianism. I conclude deontological or animal rights grounds entail the moral condemnation of faux meat and fake and secondhand <b>animal</b> <b>skin.</b> I conclude utilitarian or animal welfare grounds entail, with some qualification, the moral acceptability of faux meat and fake <b>animal</b> <b>skin</b> but the clear moral unacceptability of secondhand <b>animal</b> <b>skin...</b>|$|R
50|$|The tanning {{process begins}} with obtaining an <b>animal</b> <b>skin.</b> When an <b>animal</b> <b>skin</b> {{is to be}} tanned, the animal is killed and skinned before the body heat leaves the tissues.

5|$|The {{date and}} {{origin of the}} first device {{considered}} a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute, dates {{back as far as}} 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from <b>animal</b> <b>skins,</b> bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.|$|E
5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or <b>animal</b> <b>skins.</b> Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.|$|E
40|$|DE 102009018232 A 1 UPAB: 20101112 NOVELTY - Tanning an <b>animal</b> <b>skin,</b> comprises: (a) {{staining}} {{and picking}} the <b>animal</b> <b>skin</b> {{in an aqueous}} solution; (b) reducing the liquid content of the animal skin; (c) replacing {{at least part of}} the liquid content removed in the above step from the <b>animal</b> <b>skin</b> with a tanning solution; and (d) treating the tanning solution containing the <b>animal</b> <b>skin</b> with a compressed gas in a pressure container for a period of at least 15 minutes. USE - The method is useful for tanning an <b>animal</b> <b>skin.</b> ADVANTAGE - The method: produces less waste water and effluent; has short treatment duration with a high quality tanned leather or fur; avoids destruction of the skin structure by acid swelling since the compressed gas containing carbon dioxide increases pH to 3. 3 and prevents the acid swelling without adding an alkali and thus saves the chemicals and reduces the environmental pollution; makes the treated <b>animal</b> <b>skin</b> to absorb the full amount of the tanning agent, so there is no surplus tanning solution in the container, thus avoiding a large amount of the unused tanning agent to be reprocessed; increases the skin's absorption capacity for chromium which allows a convenient overdose (10 - 20 %) of chromium; and produces the tanned leather with a chromium oxide content of at least 4 %...|$|R

5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in <b>animal</b> <b>skins,</b> posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, <b>animal</b> <b>skins</b> (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear <b>animal</b> <b>skins</b> like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E

A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating and washing <b>animal</b> <b>skins.</b> Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies ("geese street") and rue des Veaux ("calf street"), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} hosts {{a maximum}} of 16 players. The game features three standard game modes along with modes exclusive to each system: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Sabotage (exclusive to Xbox and PC), The Hunt (exclusive to PC, PS2 and GameCube), and Power-Up (exclusive to PC and PS2). Depending on the platform, players in online and offline modes (against bots) range from 4 to 16. The GameCube version {{does not have any}} online modes, while the PC version excludes the multi-screen modes but includes a map editor. There are 13 maps on Deathmatch plus one additional on Team Deathmatch, while 5 on Capture the Flag and 3 on Sabotage. The player can choose from among 10 different character appearances, but 99 more are available in unofficial skin packs for PC players, the most recent being 2.0. Four additional <b>animal</b> <b>skins</b> (shark, duck, bat, dog, seagull) may be downloaded. As their bodies are not realistically proportioned, new or inexperienced players may face difficulty in distinguishing the skin's exact body. Cheating in both multiplayer and singleplayer is possible, as the software does not include any anti-cheat protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{scientific}} context by Charles Lyell in the third edition (1851) of his book Elements of Geology in relation to missing parts of the geological column, but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance on page xi of his book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man of 1863. By {{that time it was}} generally thought {{that the end of the}} last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings in his Antiquity of Man to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing <b>animal</b> <b>skins</b> and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E

5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and <b>animal</b> <b>skins.</b> The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
