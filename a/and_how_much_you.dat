To obtain the gold from a mine an abundance of labour is required, besides machinery for crushing quartz and separating the gold from it. In the bed of a river, if it is rich and abounding in nuggets, three or four men, with rough machinery, could wash out a large quantity of gold in a short time, and a place of that sort would be far better than a rich mine, {{which could not be}} worked without a large amount of capital." ...|$|E

50|$|To Ricardo, value {{had much}} to do with the cost of production, which {{included}} wages and profit (St. Clair 27) <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> paid a worker affected the price you put on the item. He also believed the value of a product was related to the quality of labor necessary for the production (Principles of Political 5). An example of this would be paying a slightly higher price for an item that is handmade, rather than being manufactured. Though this is true, Ricardo also thought the labor or machine itself should be considered when selling an item and that a little of every item should be priced to include this factor of labor (St. Claire 24).|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, Anne Husick (guitar) and Mark Lonergan (guitar) {{replaced}} the two former guitarists, thus creating the band's [...] "classic lineup". In {{an interview with}} The Chicago Tribune, who considered the line-up to [...] "so successfully subsume their individual abilities to the group aesthetic," [...] Poss said [...] "it's hard {{to find people who}} are both talented and restrained. The guitar ethos is this male, masturbatory thing in that if you play guitar and you're good the first {{thing you want to do}} is show people how good you are <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> know.

[...] The band signed to independent label Restless Records and began work on their third album at the start of the same year. The album was recorded at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City in May and June 1990 with engineer Oz Fritz. As with the band's prior albums, Poss was the sole producer of the album. Chris Gerhinger mastered the album at The Hit Factory, a New York recording studio famous for its clientele.|$|E
