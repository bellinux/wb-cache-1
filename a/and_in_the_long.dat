25|$|The {{extended}} {{argument on}} the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley's career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists {{than was the}} debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen's decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists.|$|E
25|$|Danish {{authorities}} therefore {{asked the}} three scheduled carries, SAS, Maersk and Cimber, to negotiate {{to see if}} they could reach an agreement. Consensus was reached in November 1971, whereby the company Danair was established. SAS held a 51-percent share of the company, while Maersk received 34 percent and Cimber 15 percent. Initially it was to organize domestic flights <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run the owners intended it to develop into a separate operator, although the latter never took place. Danair bought services from the three airlines, who retained flights to their respective destinations. Then Danair would set prices and sell tickets on the flights and the profits were paid out in relation to the ownership shares. The airlines were paid a fixed price, irrespective of their actual operating costs. Maersk fared better than SAS, as their regional airliners were more economical than SAS' Douglas DC-9 jetliners.|$|E

25|$|Alternative {{theories}} proposed include FBI incompetence, that Syria or Iraq {{directed the}} attacks, or that similar to some 9/11 conspiracy theories the U.S. government knew {{in advance that}} the attacks would occur. Senator Patrick Leahy who is Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and who had received an anthrax-tainted letter, said the FBI has not produced convincing evidence in the case. The Washington Post called for an independent investigation in the case saying that reporters and scientists were poking holes in the case. Had both attacks on the senators succeeded in killing their targets, the result {{would have been a}} Republican majority in the Senate, in the immediate future because of the loss of two Democrats, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term, as the governors of the targets' states would have been likely to name Republican replacements.

25|$|The Buxa {{range of}} Indo-Bhutan {{is also a}} part of the ancient rocks of the Himalayas. The ancient folds, running mainly along an east-west axis, were worn down during a long period of {{denudation}} lasting into cretaceous times, possibly over a hundred million years. During this time the carboniferous and permian rocks disappeared from the surface, except in its north near Hatisar in Bhutan <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> trench extending from Jaldhaka River to Torsa River, where limestone and coal deposits are preserved in discontinuous basins. Limestone deposits also appear in Bhutan on the southern flanks of the Lower Himalayas. The rocks of the highlands are mainly sandstones of the Devonian age, with limestones and shales of the same period in places. The core of the mountain is exposed across the center, where Paleozoic rocks, mainly Cambrian and Silurian slates and Takhstasang gneiss outcrops are visible in the northwest and northeast, the latter extending to western Arunachal Pradesh in India.|$|E
25|$|In {{skin wound}} healing, CYR61 is highly {{expressed}} in the granulation tissue by myofibroblasts, which proliferate and rapidly synthesize ECM to maintain tissue integrity and to promote regeneration of parenchymal cells. However, excessive matrix deposition can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of tissue function. In skin wounds, CYR61 accumulates in the granulation tissue as myofibroblasts proliferate, and eventually reaches a sufficiently high level to drive the myofibroblasts themselves into senescence, whereupon these cells cease to proliferate and express matrix-degrading enzymes. Thus, CYR61 limits synthesis and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts, {{reducing the risk of}} fibrosis during wound healing. In addition to skin wound healing, CYR61 expression is elevated in remodeling cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, in vascular injury, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> bones during fracture repair. Blockade of CYR61 by antibodies inhibits bone fracture healing in mice. In the kidney, CYR61 is expressed in podocytes in normal adult and embryonic glomeruli, but expression is decreased in IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy, particularly in diseased kidneys with severe mesangial expansion.|$|E

500|$|... x.The leftist in the 1960s {{democratic}} opposition regrouped in the 1970s {{in a different}} form, giving up in process much of its leftist moral affiliation. Defeated in 1968 by the regime which {{took advantage of the}} opposition's social isolation, the opposition activists opted for an alliance with the Polish Catholic Church. The alliance ended the opposition's isolation and legitimated the movement in popular perception. However, the cost for the Left was a surrender of its fundamental value system (the mainstream opposition could thus no longer be considered leftist) <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run, granting the Right the upper hand in the ability to mobilize mass political support. The opposition's alliance with the Church (before 1989 and after, when it became the ruling establishment) is also responsible, according to the cultural philosopher Andrzej Leder, for the marginalization of the Left and its social concept in the political spectrum of democratic Poland.|$|E
500|$|The 2005 World Summit on Social Development {{identified}} {{sustainable development}} goals, such as economic development, social development and environmental protection.

In fact, the three pillars are interdependent, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run none can exist without the others. The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years, in particular in the food industry. Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade and UTZ Certified. Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability, or a quadruple bottom line. One such pillar is future generations, which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability. [...] There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability.|$|E
500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier {{here with my}} work than I could be outside.

[...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E

500|$|Harald {{also wanted}} to re-establish Magnus's rule over Denmark, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term {{probably}} sought to restore Cnut the Great's [...] "North Sea Empire" [...] in its entirety. While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through, the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn, from 1048 almost yearly until 1064. Similar to his campaigns (then together with Sweyn) against Magnus's rule in Denmark, most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts. In 1048, he plundered Jutland, and in 1049 he pillaged and burned Hedeby, {{at the time the}} most important Danish trade center, {{and one of the best}} protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia. Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald's destruction, and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by Slavic tribes in 1066. One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year, but according to Saxo Grammaticus, Sweyn's smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape; most drowned. Although Harald was victorious in most of the engagements, he was never successful in occupying Denmark.|$|E
