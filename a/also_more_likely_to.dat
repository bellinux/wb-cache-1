5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims were <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E

30|$|Recurrent tubal ectopics: Patients with {{recurrent}} EP were <b>also</b> significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> present early than {{patients with}} a primary EP. Of all the risk factors examined, previous pelvic surgery and previous tubal surgery were the only risk factors {{found to be significantly}} associated with recurrent EP.|$|R
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 488 college {{students}} regarding ambivalent sexism towards men, researchers {{found that women who}} did not identify as feminists {{were more likely to be}} hostile towards men than self-identified feminists, but <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> hold benevolent views towards men.|$|E
50|$|Emotional items <b>also</b> appear <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{processed}} when attention is limited, suggesting a facilitated or prioritized processing of emotional information.

25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to the fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression. Older and more affluent patients are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive ECT. The use of ECT is not as common in ethnic minorities.|$|E
40|$|Freshmen in a "learning community" at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, NY, {{moved more}} quickly through {{developmental}} English requirements, took and passed more courses, and earned more credits {{in their first}} semester than students in a control group.

25|$|Older {{people have}} {{different}} requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> vote, {{and in many}} countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.|$|E
50|$|When the {{detecting}} {{system is}} a human being experience, expectations, physiological state (e.g., fatigue) and other factors can affect the threshold applied. For instance, a sentry in wartime might be <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> detect fainter stimuli than the same sentry in peacetime due to a lower criterion, however they might <b>also</b> be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> treat innocuous stimuli as a threat.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rural}} environments {{there are two}} types of crop orientations, {{subsistence}} and export. Female-headed households are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be subsistence orientated, which are often poorer. Export farmers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have substantial land endowments and to be male-headed. After structural adjustments export farmers became more vulnerable to price shocks, and women within this category more so. Female-headed households <b>also</b> became <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> change from high value export crops to subsistence.|$|R
40|$|Each {{region of}} the United States {{displays}} a distinctive pattern of religious affiliation. For example, the Northeast has more Catholics (37 %), and the fewest number of people affiliated with evangelical Protestant churches (13 %), than any other region in the U. S.

25|$|While {{agreeable}} {{individuals are}} habitually likely to help others, disagreeable {{people may be}} more likely to cause harm. Researchers have found that low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents, as well as poor social adjustment. People low in agreeableness are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be prejudiced against stigmatized groups such as the overweight.|$|E
25|$|Men {{are more}} likely to binge drink (up to 81 percent of alcohol binges are done by men) than women and men are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop alcohol {{dependence}} than women. People who are homozygous for the ALDH2 gene are less likely to binge-drink due to severe adverse effects that occur even with moderate amounts of alcohol consumption.|$|E
25|$|While {{teenagers}} {{are more likely}} to feel lonely or unhappy when not around others, they are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a more enjoyable experience with others if they have had time alone first. However, teenagers who frequently spend time alone don’t have as good a global adjustment as those who balance their time of solitude with their social time.|$|E
40|$|This {{bulletin}} presents {{results from}} the 2010 National Prisoner Health Census, and focuses on the associations between mental health {{and a range of}} characteristics and behaviours reported by prison entrants. Generally, prison entrants with mental health issues have relatively poor socioeconomic and health characteristics and are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in risky health behaviours. They <b>also</b> are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use prison health services and use them more frequently...|$|R
50|$|An American {{study found}} that Waldorf-educated {{students}} {{scored significantly higher on}} a test of moral reasoning than students in public high schools and students in a religiously affiliated high school.

30|$|Distinguishing by firms’ size, we {{find that}} despite being the ones more {{concerned}} about labor regulations, 19 large firms are only slightly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> provide training as EPL become stricter, while small firms are very much affected and much <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> provide training. This {{is not the case}} for the use of temporary work, where no statistically significant difference can be found across firms of different sizes, although small firms <b>also</b> become <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use temporary workers.|$|R
25|$|Between 40% and 50% of all {{children}} who develop cerebral palsy were born prematurely. Most of these cases (75-90%) {{are believed to be}} due to issues that occur around the time of birth, often just after birth. Multiple-birth infants are also more likely than single-birth infants to have CP. They are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be born with a low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|Teens from non-white, low-income {{families}} {{are more likely}} to receive abstinence-only sex education, according to the National Survey of Family and Growth. Teens with intact families are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive comprehensive sex education than those living with a single parent. Disadvantaged youth are the shown to be the least likely social strata to benefit from formal sex education programs.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1930s most legal {{immigrants}} were male. By the 1990s women accounted for {{just over half}} of all {{legal immigrants}}. Contemporary immigrants tend to be younger than the native population of the United States, with people {{between the ages of}} 15 and 34 substantially overrepresented. Immigrants are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be married and less likely to be divorced than native-born Americans of the same age.|$|E
30|$|Motivation is a {{psychological}} construct that {{is fundamental to}} students’ academic success [45]. Motivation {{can be defined as}} “the processes that energize, direct, and sustain behavior” [44, pp. 414]. Highly motivated students may be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in behaviors that enhance academic performance [15, 16, 31, 54], including effective goal-setting, focusing effort, and persisting in academic challenges [35, 51]. Highly motivated students <b>also</b> are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> view academic tasks as valuable and important [27, 56].|$|R
40|$|Gender {{is rarely}} {{used as a}} {{differentiating}} lens by which to understand more fully the various experiences and ramifications of the social protection agenda.

50|$|Many {{graduate}} programs and professional schools require undergraduate research. For example, admissions boards for medical schools look for research experience when admitting students. Therefore, {{not only will}} pre-medical students benefit from learning how to apply hypothesis-based research, but they will <b>also</b> be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be accepted to medical school if they have participated in undergraduate research. This holds true for {{graduate programs}} {{in a variety of}} subjects.|$|R
