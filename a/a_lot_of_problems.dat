5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De la Hoya {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his nose was also bleeding. Trinidad was having <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> finding De La Hoya and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking and basically disengaged. De La Hoya gassed out and had remained on his toes {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Dickinson {{recommended}} Lowe {{to lead the}} Greater Dallas Council of Churches, and the leadership accepted him. The Council of Churches became a legitimate agency of the churches through which they could work “for justice and {{what is best for}} the City of Dallas” rather than a way of mobilizing area churches to support the policies of the Dallas Citizens Council. Lowe remained president for three years. He successfully increased the budget, and two programs were begun: one a city-wide counseling service staffed by ministers, and the other a permanent ministry at the county jail. A third program and by far the most controversial was Block Partnership, a plan to help solve problems in minority neighborhoods and to improve race relations by linking them with comparatively affluent white church groups. More than fifty partnerships were established between black and white neighborhoods, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> were solved.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka: RAW started {{training}} the LTTE {{to keep a}} check on Sri Lanka, which had helped Pakistan in the Indo-Pak War by allowing Pakistani ships to refuel at Sri Lankan ports. However, the LTTE created <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> and complications and the then Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi was forced to send the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region. The disastrous mission of the IPKF was blamed by many {{on the lack of}} co-ordination between the IPKF and RAW. Its most disastrous manifestation was the Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ in the Jaffna University campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The site was chosen without any consultation with the RAW. The dropping paratroopers became easy targets for the LTTE. A number of soldiers were killed. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi is also blamed as a fallout of the failed RAW operation in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the show {{featured}} the lucha libre unique Mini-Estrellas division, a division {{that is not the}} same as midget professional wrestling, in the fact that it is not restricted to people with dwarfism but also wrestlers who are generally short in stature. IWRG does not have a regular Mini-Estrella division, which meant that this special attraction match featured workers from AAA and the Mexican Independent circuit, some who may work in the regular division elsewhere. The match was originally announced as Mini Espiritu teaming with Mini Psicosis and Piratita Morgan, Jr., but he was replaced by Mini Ozz on the night with no explanation given for the substitution. Mini Psicosis was the reigning AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion, Mini Ozz is a smaller version of Dark Ozz from AAA and Piratita Morgan, Jr. is the latest wrestler to use the name and ring character of a smaller version of Pirata Morgan, or perhaps in this case Morgan's sons Hijo de Pirata Morgan/Pirata Morgan, Jr. The trio took on and defeated the tecnico trio of Mini Batista, Mini Rey Cometa, Mini Super Astro. Mini Batista works as a comedy mini version of former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Batista, Mini Rey Cometa as a smaller version of Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) worker Rey Cometa and Mini Super Astro as mini of Super Astro, who himself is close to the Mini-Estrella height limit. The second match of the evening featured six IWRG regulars as the team of Alan Extreme, Carta Brava, Jr. and Eita defeated Avisman, Cerebro Negro and Dinamic Black. The third match of the night and the first match with a background to it saw the clash of Los Oficiales, represented by Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro and the splinter faction Los Comandos Élite, represented by Rayan and Spartan. On the night Comandos Élite defeated Los Oficiales, adding another chapter to the feud between the two factions. In the fourth match Los Traumas showed that they had not forgotten El Ángel's actions the last time they teamed up together and the trio did not get along at all. While neither side actually turned on each other or came to blows there was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> for the team. The problems lead to Bestia 666, Canis Lupus and Damián 666 taking advantage of it to win the match. Following the match Los Traumas challenged their tag team partner to put his mask on the line.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{timetable}} set by the RCAF, Avro decided that Arrow program would adopt the Cook-Craigie plan. Normally a small number of prototypes of an aircraft were hand built and flown to find problems, and when solutions were found these changes would be worked into the design and then the production line would be set up. In a Cook-Craigie system, the production line was set up first and a small number of aircraft were built as production models. Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued, with full production starting when the test program was complete. As Jim Floyd noted at the time, this was a risky approach, however: [...] "...it was decided to take the technical risks involved to save time on the programme... I will not pretend that this philosophy of production type build from the outset did not cause us <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> in Engineering.

Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> with it and the group continued trying to fix it up.

500|$|During development, {{the team}} faced <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> when {{designing}} the game {{so it would}} be both familiar for series fans and fresh to old and new players. The pieces of gameplay experimentation meant that the development was [...] "a more fundamental ground-up process" [...] than earlier titles such as The Wind Waker. Their earlier titles had involved lifting elements from earlier games and pasting them into a new entry, but for Skyward Sword the developers wanted to add a new play structure to avoid fans seeing it as more of the same. The original concept for gameplay using the Wii MotionPlus was proposed by Fujibayashi at a point when the team were already developing the gameplay around the console's standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk control scheme. When first proposed, Aonuma was highly enthusiastic, and his wish to change to Wii MotionPlus meant that work on the game needed to begin all over again. The use of Wii MotionPlus proved challenging for the developers to implement, to the point where at one point Aonuma seriously considered dropping it from the game entirely. After the release of Wii Sports Resort, the team saw how motion controls could be used for swordplay: after talking with the development team, they were able to borrow the technology and used it to create the motion-driven swordplay. The implementation of Wii MotionPlus meant that the enemy artificial intelligence needed to be able to counter it, adjusting their stances depending on the position of Link's sword.|$|E

I think in retrospect {{we made a mistake}} in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity."
