We demonstrate an endocrine modulation of the deleterious effects of gp 120 in primary hippocampal and cortical cultures. Specifically, we observe that gp 120 -induced calcium mobilization and neurotoxicity are exacerbated by glucocorticoids, the adrenal steroids secreted during stress. Importantly, this deleterious synergy can occur between gp 120 and synthetic glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) that are used clinically in high concentrations to treat severe cases of the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia typical of HIV infection.

50|$|Gliosis is the {{universal}} {{response of the}} CNS to tissue injury and {{occurs as a result}} of many acute conditions such as trauma, ischemia, and stroke.

In every case, gliosis involves some degree of hypertrophy or proliferation of glial cells, but the extent and nature of the gliosis response vary widely based on the triggering insult. Gliosis in any form entails an alteration in cellular activity that has the potential to create widespread effects on neurons as well as other non-neural cells, causing either a loss of normal functions or a gain of detrimental ones.

The pathogenesis of <b>dementia</b> <b>complex</b> is poorly understood and effective treatments have not been developed, {{in part because of}} the lack of an appropriate animal model. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (scid mice), which accept xenografts without rejection, were intracerebrally inoculated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HIV. One to 4 weeks after inoculation, the brains of these mice contained human macrophages (some of which were HIV p 24 antigen positive), occasional multinucleated cells, and striking gliosis by immunocytochemical staining. Human macrophages also were frequently positive for tumor necrosis factor type alpha and occasionally for interleukin 1 and VLA- 4. Cultures of these brains for HIV were positive. Generally, human macrophages were not present in the brains of control mice, nor was significant gliosis, and HIV was not recovered from mice that received HIV only intracerebrally. Pathologically, this model of HIV encephalitis in scid mice resembles HIV encephalitis in humans and the data suggest that the activation of macrophages by infection with HIV results in their accumulation and persistence in brain and in the development of gliosis.

RESULTS: Ten patients had HIV associated <b>dementia</b> <b>complex,</b> six had cryptococcal meningitis, two had primary CNS lymphoma and nine had miscellaneous conditions including herpes simplex virus encephalitis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and mononeuritis multiplex.

40|$|Infection {{by human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is often complicated {{by a variety of}} neurological abnormalities. The most common clinical syndrome, termed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (<b>AIDS)</b> <b>dementia</b> <b>complex,</b> presents as a subcortical dementia with cognitive, motor, and behavioral disturbances and is unique to HIV- 1 infection. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is poorly understood but is believed to involve interactions among virally infected macrophages/microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. In this study, we show that exposure of primary rat and human astrocytes to heat-activated HIV- 1 virions, or to eukaryotically expressed HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 envelope glycoproteins (gp 120) stimulates amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport, potassium conductance, and glutamate efflux. These effects are blocked specifically by amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiport and by the selective removal of gp 120 with immobilized monoclonal antibody. As a result of modulation of astrocytic function by gp 120, the ensuing neuronal depolarization and glutamate exposure could activate both voltage-gated and N-methyl-D-aspartate-regulated Ca 2 + channels, leading to increases in intraneuronal Ca 2 + and neuronal death.
