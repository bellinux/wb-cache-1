5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} {{history of}} the Uranian atmosphere is long and full of error and frustration. Uranus is a relatively faint object, and its visible angular diameter is smaller than 4″. The first spectra of Uranus were observed through a prism in 1869 and 1871 by Angelo Secchi and William Huggins, who found a number of broad dark bands, which {{they were unable to}} identify. They also failed to detect any solar Fraunhofer lines—the fact later interpreted by Norman Lockyer as indicating that Uranus emitted its own light as opposed to reflecting light from the Sun. In 1889 however, astronomers observed solar Fraunhofer lines in photographic ultraviolet spectra of the planet, proving once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> Uranus was shining by reflected light. The nature of the broad dark bands in its visible spectrum remained unknown until the fourth decade of the twentieth century.|$|E

Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> we [...] cannot carry {{on with our lives}} within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state.

And we never will stop, lest we vanquish or perish." ...|$|E
500|$|The attack {{started at}} 21:00, 11 November 1940, {{when the first}} of two waves of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers took off from Illustrious, {{followed}} by the second wave an hour later. The attack was a [...] great success: the Italian fleet lost half its strength in one night. The [...] "fleet-in-being" [...] diminished in importance and the threat to the Royal Navy's control of the Mediterranean had been considerably reduced. Cunningham said of the victory: [...] "Taranto, and the night of 11–12 November 1940, should be remembered for ever as having shown once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> in the Fleet Air Arm the Navy has its most devastating weapon." [...] The Royal Navy had launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier. This, and other aspects of the raid, were important facts in the planning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941: the Japanese planning staff were thought to have studied it intensively.|$|E

500|$|In Britain, the {{reception}} was highly favourable. In their joint review for Record Mirror, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album [...] "full of musical ingenuity" [...] yet [...] "controversial", and added: [...] "There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle." [...] Allen Evans of the NME highlighted the album's [...] "electronic effects", McCartney's [...] "penchant for the classics" [...] and Harrison's [...] "stunning {{use of the}} sitar" [...] as diverse elements that distinguished it as a group effort, such that the four band members' [...] "individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear". Evans concluded: [...] "this is a brilliant album which underlines once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of {{what we used to}} call pop." [...] Having found Rubber Soul [...] "almost monotonous" [...] at times, Melody Maker lauded the new release as a work that would [...] "change the direction of pop music". Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for Gramophone magazine, described it as [...] "an astonishing collection" [...] that defied easy categorisation since much of the album had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: [...] "if there's anything wrong with the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps {{compared}} the video {{with the music}} video of [...] "November Rain". The scenes of the dead models were described as stomach turning while he complimented the video for [...] "brimming with cinematic style [...] that it's hard to take your eyes off it, though it will likely be labeled as a little self-indulgent." [...] He also commented on the leaking of the video saying that it [...] "warranted {{more than just a}} simple leak; it deserved a red carpet." [...] Anna Pickard from The Guardian complimented the video saying that [...] "quite a lot of work has gone into it". However, she opined that the video was too long. Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the video, saying it [...] "gives us even more of the next-level cuckoo we've come to expect from the girl born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta." [...] The paparazzi theme of the video was compared to Britney Spears's 2004 music video, [...] "Everytime". MTV News called the video a [...] "1940s romantic-epic-style video" [...] that [...] "proves once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> Gaga is a true original with a unique vision." [...] The video was nominated for five VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Special Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with four other nominations for [...] "Poker Face", she and Beyoncé were tied for most nominations that year. The video won the award for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects.

2500|$|The {{defendants}} {{in each of}} the five cases urged the Court to go further than it had in Furman by holding once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> capital punishment was cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment. However the Court responded that [...] "The most marked indication of society's endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to Furman." [...] Both Congress and 35 states had complied with the Court's dictates in Furman by either specifying factors to be weighed and procedures to be followed when imposing a death sentence, or dictating that the death penalty would be mandatory for specific crimes. Furthermore, a referendum in California had overturned the California Supreme Court's earlier decision (California v. Anderson) holding that the death penalty violated the California constitution. The fact that juries remained willing to impose the death penalty also contributed to the Court's conclusion that American society did not believe in 1976 that the death penalty was unconstitutional.|$|E

On the subject of cost, Mallender said: [...] "Every £1m of cost involves a payment £5 per household in Corby on average, per year, for the next 20 years.

2500|$|In 1749, Richardson's female friends {{started asking}} him to create a male figure as virtuous as his heroines [...] "Pamela" [...] and [...] "Clarissa" [...] in order to [...] "give the world his {{idea of a good}} man and fine gentleman combined". Although he did not at first agree, he {{eventually}} complied, starting work on a book in this vein in June 1750. Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel The History of Sir Charles Grandison to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalized in the middle of 1752. When the novel was being printed in 1753, Richardson discovered that Irish printers were trying to pirate the work. He immediately fired those he suspected of giving the printers advanced copies of Grandison and relied on multiple London printing firms to help him produce an authentic edition before the pirated version was sold. The first four volumes were published on 13 November 1753, and in December the next two would follow. The remaining volume was published in March to complete a seven volume series while a six volume set was simultaneously published, and these met success. In Grandison, Richardson was unwilling to risk having a negative response to any [...] "rakish" [...] characteristics that Lovelace embodied and denigrated the immoral characters [...] "to show those mischievous young admirers of Lovelace once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> the rake should be avoided".|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rapid}} {{deterioration}} of the China front after Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, Stilwell saw {{this as an opportunity}} to gain full command of all Chinese armed forces. Operation Ichi-Go was the largest Japanese offensive of World War II designed to [...] "liquidate the China affair" [...] by knocking China out of the war once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> saw some half-million men and 800 tanks, supplied by 70 to 100, 000 horses dragging wagons and 12, 000 to 15, 000 vehicles committed to an operation that overran huge areas of China. Stillwell clashed with Chiang over the question of the city of Guilin, which was besieged by the Japanese. Chiang wanted Guilin defended to the last men while Stillwell claimed Guilin was a lost cause. In his diary, Stillwell wrote: [...] "What they ought to do is to shoot the G-mo [...] and Ho [...] and the rest of the gang". Stillwell ordered the American troops to pull out of Guilin, and was able to persuade Chiang to reluctantly accept the loss of Guilin. The clash over Guilin was only a prelude to another clash, where Chiang demanded the return of the Y Force from Burma to defend Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, which was also threatened by the Japanese advance. After meeting Chiang, Stilwell wrote in his diary that Chiang was a [...] "crazy little bastard with that hickory nut he uses for a head...
