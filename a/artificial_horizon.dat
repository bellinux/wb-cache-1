5|$|From 2003, A320's feature {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) units in the flight deck of its A318, A319, A320, and A321 flight decks instead of the {{original}} cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include the main displays and the backup <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon,</b> which was an analog display prior to this.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Peterson, who {{had failed}} an {{instrument}} checkride nine {{months before the}} accident, had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> as source of aircraft attitude information, while N3794N was equipped with an older-type Sperry F3 attitude gyroscope. Crucially, {{the two types of}} instruments display the same aircraft pitch attitude information in graphically opposite ways.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon,</b> compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was on initial climb-out following take-off; as it entered clouds both <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> failed, so {{the crew had}} no visual reference. The aircraft banked to the left, dived and crashed into a house 7 km from Vnukovo International Airport.|$|R
5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon,</b> to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E

50|$|An Air Accident Investigation Branch {{report found}} that one or both <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> in the {{aircraft}} failed, leading to loss of control by the pilots and the plane entering a spiral dive exceeding operating parameters and leading to partial break-up before impact.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Leeds Bradford {{airport at}} 16:47 hours UTC departure from runway 14, and was observed immediately to veer off the ATC instructed flight path; {{one minute and}} 50 second into the fight, the first officer reported problems with the <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> in the plane and asked to return to Leeds Bradford.|$|R
25|$|The F-102 {{received}} several major modifications during its operational lifetime, with most airframes being retrofitted with infrared search/tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> and {{improvements to the}} fire control system.

25|$|As {{the plane}} descended through clouds, the captain's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} the <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> which displayed excessive bank and pitch. Because such an attitude is highly irregular, the captain incorrectly assumed the indicators to be faulty. Without any visual references (due to the clouds) and having rejected the information from the ADIs, the captain and first officer became spatially disoriented.|$|E
25|$|The {{cantilever}} gulled wings followed {{normal practice}} with a plywood-covered torsion box leading edge, mainspar, ribs and false rear spar {{to support the}} full-span flaps and ailerons. DFS-style airbrakes were fitted {{at the rear of}} the mainspar with the upper plates hinging forwards and the lower plates hinging rearwards. A comprehensive instrument panel was fitted in the cockpit which included:-A large plaque on the instrument panel; AirSpeed Indicator (8), Vertical Speed Indicator to 5m/s, Vertical Speed Indicator to 15m/s, an <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> with slip ball, altimeter, longitudinal clinometer, stopwatch, compass and oxygen pressure gauge (oxygen equipment was housed behind the pilots seat).|$|E
25|$|This testing also {{demonstrated}} two unexpected and ultimately very useful {{features of the}} spiral scan system. The first was that since the scanning pattern crossed the ground when the antenna was pointed down, the ground returns produced a series of curved stripes along the lower portion of the display. This formed an analogue of an <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon,</b> one that radar operators found extremely useful in combat because they could immediately see if the pilot was responding correctly to their commands. Various {{members of the team}} record having been surprised by this outcome, noting that the effect was obvious in retrospect and should have been predicted.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding equipment, the Air Corps had in its {{inventory}} 274 Directional gyros and 460 <b>Artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> {{but very}} few of these were mounted in aircraft.

25|$|Briggs was {{detailed}} by an Executive Order to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Standards in 1917 due to mobilization {{pressures of}} World War I. There he developed an <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> device for naval vessels with John Hayford which established a stable zenith {{independent of the}} roll of the vessel for the aiming of naval guns. This allowed for the roll of the ship to be observed, so that the firing of the guns could be timed with the roll of the ship. The device was so successful it {{found its way into}} the control rooms of most naval vessels. A confidential report called the Hayford–Briggs report was given to the Navy, but never published.|$|E
25|$|The other effect {{occurred}} when the dish was pointed towards the ground, causing a strong return that produced a sharp return on the display. Due to the circular scanning pattern, the dish would be pointed to the sides when the beam first struck the ground, continuing to strike the ground while the scanner continued rotating until it is pointed down, and then back up until the beam no longer intersects the ground again. Since the beam strikes the ground at a point closer to the aircraft when it is pointed straight down, the returns during this period are closest to the zero ring. When the reflector rotated further to the sides the beam would strike the ground further away and produce blips further from the zero line. Conveniently, the geometry of the situation causes the returns to form a series of straight lines, producing an effect similar to an <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

50|$|Given that Elton's {{quadrant}} {{was roughly}} {{as complex as}} an octant in construction, there would not likely be a significant advantage in price. The octant was an easier instrument to use and Hadley had supported the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> on the octant {{in the form of}} spirit levels. This would have given no advantage to Elton's instrument. In addition, there were many other instruments competing for the attention of navigators in this period. In the end, the Hadley octant and later sextant took precedence as instruments for navigators.|$|R
50|$|On 31 March 1991, a Vickers Viscount (registration HK-1708) of Intercontinental de Aviación made an {{emergency}} landing at the airport after experiencing an instrument failure during a cargo flight from El Dorado International Airport in Bogota to Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport on the Caribbean island of San Andrés. While cruising at 16000 ft both <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> failed during turbulence {{and control of the}} aircraft was only regained at 4000 ft.

5000|$|Butler and Knight {{contend that}} henges, which exist only in Britain, {{would have been}} the world's first star observatories.

500|$|Eaton {{was posted}} to Britain {{following}} {{the end of}} World WarII, and attended RAF Staff College the next year. [...] In September 1947, he was appointed Officer Commanding No.81 (Fighter) Wing in Japan, as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). The Australian contingent initially comprised three combat units, Nos.76, 77 and 82 Squadrons, as well as No.381 (Base) Squadron, No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron, No.111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and No.5 Airfield Construction Squadron. By mid-1949, it had been reduced to No.77 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton served as [...] "RAAF Component" [...] commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan. As well as surveillance patrols, training and inter-service exercises, the Australian airmen took part in ceremonial flypasts. On one such occasion, over Tokyo, Eaton led his formation of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a faulty <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> in his plane, with the result that he and his comrades, who were following his lead, became badly disorientated and were fortunate to avoid collision; RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered this a not-atypical example of the casual attitude to flying safety exhibited at the time by the veteran pilots of World WarII.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft sextants are {{now out of}} production, but {{had special}} features. Most had <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons</b> to permit taking a sight through a flush {{overhead}} window. Some also had mechanical averagers to make hundreds of measurements per sight for compensation of random accelerations in the artificial horizon's fluid. Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one's lap. More modern aircraft sextants were periscopic with only a small projection above the fuselage. With these, the navigator pre-computed his sight and then noted the difference in observed versus predicted height {{of the body to}} determine his position.|$|R

All 12 occupants were killed. The probable cause of the accident was the failure of one or both <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> instruments. There was no standby <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon</b> installed (as there was no airworthiness requirement for one on this aircraft) and the accident report concluded that this left the crew without a single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed.

2500|$|The State Supervisory Commission for Flight Safety board cited {{among the}} causes of the crash {{included}} failure of the <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon,</b> poor visibility from the cockpit, and lack of warnings indicating the failure of the <b>artificial</b> <b>horizon.</b> [...] Due to the damage to the aircraft caused by the crash, it was impossible to determine if the ailerons were functioning correctly at the time. [...] The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorders were both missing the last six seconds of data, presumably as result of the damage in the post-crash fire. [...] The board concluded that the crew demonstrated excellent calm in the emergency in their efforts to fly with incorrect data from the aircraft; weather was not determined to be a primary cause of the crash.

40|$|Abstract Background Working {{while exposed}} to motions, {{physically}} and psychologically affects a person. Traditionally, motion sickness symptom reduction has implied use of medication, {{which can lead}} to detrimental effects on performance. Non-pharmaceutical strategies, in turn, often require cognitive and perceptual attention. Hence, for people working in high demand environments where it is impossible to reallocate focus of attention, other strategies are called upon. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate possible impact of a mitigation strategy on perceived motion sickness and psychophysiological responses, based on an <b>artificial</b> sound <b>horizon</b> compared with a non-positioned sound source. Methods Twenty-three healthy subjects were seated on a motion platform in an <b>artificial</b> sound <b>horizon</b> or in non-positioned sound, in random order with one week interval between the trials. Perceived motion sickness (Mal), maximum duration of exposure (ST), skin conductance, blood volume pulse, temperature, respiration rate, eye movements and heart rate were measured continuously throughout the trials. Results Mal scores increased over time in both sound conditions, but the <b>artificial</b> sound <b>horizon,</b> applied as a mitigation strategy for perceived motion sickness, showed no significant effect on Mal scores or ST. The number of fixations increased with time in the non-positioned sound condition. Moreover, fixation time was longer in the non-positioned sound condition compared with sound horizon, indicating that the subjects used more time to fixate and, hence, assumingly made fewer saccades. Conclusion A subliminally presented <b>artificial</b> sound <b>horizon</b> did not significantly affect perceived motion sickness, psychophysiological variables or the time the subjects endured the motion sickness triggering stimuli. The number of fixations and fixation times increased over time in the non-positioned sound condition. </p...|$|R

The aircraft was designed with side-by-side seating to facilitate pilot training, a popular concept in the 1950s (also used with the American Cessna T-37, British Hawker Hunter T.7 and English Electric Lightning T.4, among others). This required a redesign of the cockpit and nose incorporating a set of vortex generators {{on the top of}} the cockpit to prevent flow separation under certain circumstances, and repositioning of the intake ducts. Despite the many changes, the aircraft was combat-capable, although this variant was predictably slower, reaching only subsonic speeds in level flight.|$|R
5000|$|Latitude was {{measured}} in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the [...] "noon sight"), or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of Polaris, the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which {{it is not in}} the Southern Hemisphere). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the celestial north pole. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the zenith, is not normally possible. When haze obscures the <b>horizon,</b> navigators use <b>artificial</b> <b>horizons,</b> which are horizontal mirrors of pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury historically. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.|$|R
