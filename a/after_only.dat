5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} slowly and marched into Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army left {{at the end of}} the summer <b>after</b> <b>only</b> a brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E

5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS.

A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected.
