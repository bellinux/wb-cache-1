5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task</b> for Tubman.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for {{a new type of}} submarine to replace the Oberon class of diesel-electric submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the need to start considering a replacement for the ageing Oberons. The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task</b> because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought it could be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E

In 2003, Cioculescu edited another volume of his friend's selected works, titled after Plantația de cuie. While periodic exhumations in Sfânta Vineri have made tracking down Tonegaru's remains <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task,</b> he is honored by the Museum of Romanian Literature with a bust in his likeness, and, on the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2009, {{was the subject of a}} special exhibit in his native Galaţi.|$|E

Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.|$|E

25|$|Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón (September 7, 1839 – September 30, 1917) was {{a career}} Spanish naval officer who {{commanded}} the restored Kingdom of Spain's Pacific Squadron {{based in the}} Philippines during the Spanish–American War. Considered {{to have been a}} man of high ability and experience, he was given what was regarded as <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task</b> of defending the Spanish Philippines with antiquated ships and low supplies against the more formidable U.S. Asiatic Squadron. Montojo became known for his defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay (1 May 1898) by U.S. Navy Admiral George Dewey, being a decisive naval battle of the war. After the conflict, the rear admiral was held accountable for the defeat and was court-martialed, but that was later overturned, though Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.|$|E
25|$|Although bite mark {{analysis}} {{has been used}} in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore and Barbenel and Evans have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to have a number of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in exactly the same position it was in when the bite occurred which can be a difficult if not <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task</b> to accomplish. Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion. Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be {{due to the fact that}} such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Sidebottom dug {{out the top}} four, {{ending with}} four for 41, and Andrew Harris got exactly the same figures (but from half the overs), as Warwickshire crashed to 156 at Trent Bridge after winning the toss and opting to bat first. And from then on, it only got worse for the {{visitors}} from the Midlands. Only Dougie Brown's 34 not out took them past 150, and he then took two wickets as Nottinghamshire looked to go the same way - being 45 for 3. However, David Hussey and Chris Read batted well together, seeing Nottinghamshire to stumps and making fifties. Their 148-run partnership gave Nottinghamshire a healthy lead, but Hussey did not stop there. He made a career-best 232 not out - eventually running out of partners as Nottinghamshire finished on 514, to secure a first-innings lead of 358. Brown took five for 128, but despite bowling the most overs of all he could not stop the rampant Hussey. Nick Knight was injured and could not bat, so with ten men Warwickshire had to score 358 to make Nottinghamshire bat again. It was <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task</b> - Alex Loudon and Neil Carter both made scores in the forties, but the team succumbed to 207 and their third innings defeat of the season. Warwickshire were later deducted 0.5 points for a slow over rate on day two.|$|E

25|$|In the club's {{first season}} of league football, Wigan Athletic {{finished}} in sixth place, just six points off promotion and playing {{in front of}} an average crowd of 6,701. Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980–81 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager Ian McNeill shortly {{before the end of the}} season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former Liverpool player Larry Lloyd in 1981–82, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football's third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd's sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by Harry McNally. Under McNally's management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984–85 season cost him his job, with Tranmere manager Bryan Hamilton stepping into the breach. Under Hamilton's management, the club's performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the Freight Rover Trophy. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by Bolton Wanderers. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>task</b> earlier that season.|$|E
