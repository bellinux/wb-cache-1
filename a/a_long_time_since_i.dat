5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It has been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> spoke {{to you in a}} bathroom, ripping you up, fuckin' and chokin' you". He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses [...] "I can't love you this much".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{arriving}} in Phoenix, the 1991 McLaren chassis had had {{only had one}} brief test session, and the two race cars were completed about 4 am Friday, six hours before the first practice session. [...] Working to prepare the new car, Ayrton Senna claimed he had never gotten totally comfortable with the increasing complexity of the sport since helping Lotus introduce the first active suspension car in 1987, and he still {{found it hard to}} embrace the huge role of computers in achieving a proper setup. [...] "Friday, to understand and interpret things properly, I worked with the engineers into the evening," [...] Senna said. [...] "It has been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> did that. The engineers and I talked our way around the circuit, then we compared this with what the computer predicted. It was great because the computer confirmed almost everything, and it also showed where there was room for improvement." ...|$|E

Lisa returns to care for Louise after she is seriously injured, arriving at the hospital in the closing moments of the episode. McFadden will also return to the serial in the episodes following Lisa's return and a show insider commented, [...] "When that hospital door starts to open, [...] be on tenterhooks to see who has rushed to help Louise. When {{it turns out to be}} Lisa, rather than Phil, there will be gasps of shock. It’s such a brilliant surprise." [...] The show released no official confirmation on the reports, although Lisa returned in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017. It was subsequently confirmed that Lisa would be returning for a [...] "brief stint" [...] and would share scenes with Phil following his return. On her return, Benjamin commented, [...] "It was great to be back at EastEnders as it has been such <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had been there. I loved being back in Elstree for the few weeks I was there, seeing old friends again and working with really talented people. I loved every minute of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, {{came up with the}} idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Queensland Labor Premier, Anna Bligh, {{described}} Andrews' {{criticism of}} Sudanese as [...] "disturbing". She said: [...] "It has been <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have heard such a pure form of racism {{out of the}} mouth of any Australian politician." [...] Labor politician Tony Burke branded Andrews' decision as [...] "incompetent". [...] However, Andrew's actions were applauded by the former One Nation politician, Pauline Hanson. Andrews was accused of helping to fuel assaults of Sudanese. During the controversy one criticism was that Andrews justified his decision based on [...] "concerns raised by the community", however no official report or inquest has been tendered, leading {{to the conclusion that}} any 'concerns' were both unofficial, undocumented and most probably belonging to a racially intolerant minority. The Howard government had before used the race card in an election year to distract the voters from its other failures. This was most significant in the 2001 election with the infamous Tampa affair, in which the government was badly trailing in the polls before vilifying middle-eastern [...] "boat people". The strategy worked for the government by exploiting the underlying racist elements of Australian society. Andrews defended the system of having refugee quotas against the opinion expressed that intakes of refugees should be variated on the basis of global needs [...]" [...] In October 2007, Howard [...] "admitted breaking a promise to keep interest rates at record lows". During the 2004 campaign, Howard was also cited as giving the same promise, personally, on radio. Inflation figures released on 24 October indicated underlying inflation was higher than expected, which resulted in seven of eight financial companies believing there will be an interest rate rise when the reserve bank met in the middle of November, the first during an election campaign.|$|E
