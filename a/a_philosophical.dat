40|$|Recent work in {{philosophical}} methodology by experimental philosophers {{has brought}} to light {{a certain kind of}} skepticism about the role of intuitions in <b>a</b> priori <b>philosophical</b> inquiry. In this paper I turn attention away from <b>a</b> priori <b>philosophical</b> inquiry and on to the role of intuition in experimental design. I argue that even if we have reason to be skeptical about the role of intuition in <b>a</b> priori <b>philosophical</b> inquiry, we cannot remove intuition from inquiry altogether, because appeals to intuition are essential for experimental design...|$|R
5|$|Goldman {{was well}} known during her life, {{described}} as—among other things—"the most dangerous woman in America". After her death and through the middle part of the 20th century, her fame faded. Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist, but did not regard her as <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> or theoretical thinker on par with, for instance, Kropotkin.|$|E

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. It began as <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} years {{following}} Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories {{in which the}} author wished to make <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> point. Originally, Grant created Anarky as an anarchist with socialist and populist leanings. In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E

5|$|Chinese society {{during the}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was marked by}} {{political}} and legal reforms, <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> revival of Confucianism, {{and the development of}} cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and maritime commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry—a small, elite community of educated scholars and scholar-officials.|$|E
5|$|Chopsticks: The Han dynasty {{historian}} and writer Sima Qian (145–86 BC) {{wrote in the}} Records of the Grand Historian that King Zhou of Shang {{was the first to}} make chopsticks out of ivory in the 11th century BC; the most ancient archaeological find of a pair of chopsticks, made of bronze, comes from Shang Tomb 1005 at Houjiazhuang, Anyang, dated roughly 1200 BC. By 600 BC, the use of chopsticks had spread to Yunnan (Dapona in Dali), and Töv Province by the 1st century. The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the Han Feizi, <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> text written by writer and philosopher Han Fei (c. 280–233 BC) in the 3rd century BC.|$|E

5|$|Georges-Antoine Belcourt {{was born}} on April 22, 1803 at Baie-du-Febvre, Quebec to Antoine Belcourt and Josephte Lemire, who had married on February 23, 1802. His parents, devout Roman Catholics, brought their son {{up in the same}} faith, and the young Belcourt {{received}} his first Holy Communion in 1814. At age 13, Belcourt enrolled in Le Petit Séminaire de Québec to undertake <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> course of study, which he completed in 1823. Belcourt studied to become a priest, and on March 10, 1827, Bernard-Claude Panet, the Archbishop of Quebec, performed Belcourt's ordination in the chapel at the Seminary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the seventeenth century Bishop John Wilkins, the first {{secretary}} of the Royal Society in England, was asked by the society to devise a universal standard of measure. In 1668, in his book An Essay towards a Real Character and <b>a</b> <b>Philosophical</b> Language, on the possibility of an international language, he devoted a short section to physical measurement in which he proposed an integrated system of measurement based on a decimal system. While Wilkins did propose his system two years before Moulton, it was never promoted and lay undiscovered until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to <b>a</b> <b>Philosophical</b> Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E

5|$|The Greek philosopher Zeno {{considered}} {{the problem of}} summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility: the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, {{as it had been}} prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes's method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result. Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief and}} {{practices}} of the Hanzhong Celestial Masters had a profound legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a significant change from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first Celestial Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements, {{as well as the}} medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first Celestial Masters.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it <b>a</b> <b>philosophical</b> meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E
