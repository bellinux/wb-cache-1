40|$|Judicial {{expression}} of views prior to or during a hearing may provide useful guidance for lawyers in presenting a client 2 ̆ 7 s case, {{and can be}} a means of narrowing and focusing issues in dispute. Yet {{it is also possible}} for judicial {{expression of}} a preliminary view to give rise to claims of prejudgment and bias. Recently, the Full Court of the Family Court has <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> <b>approach</b> to judges expressing preliminary views. This article examines this in the context of other authority that has held that expression of a preliminary view is permissible and, indeed, perhaps even desirable...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{wireless}} access {{has become an}} essential part of modern society. Consequently, the demand for new wireless applications and services, as well as the number of wireless users, are gradually increasing. Given that this amount of expansion is eventually controlled by the available radio frequency spectrum, government regulatory agencies have recently <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> <b>approach</b> to the licensing of limited amounts of spectrum to different entities (e. g., public safety, military, service providers, unlicensed devices, and TV). All of them possess exclusive transmissions to their assigned frequency channels. A new study on spectrum efficiency revealed big geographic and temporal variations in spectrum utilisation, ranging from 15 - 85...|$|R

The author argues, first, that this new approach is hardly consistent with the Court’s jurisprudence and, second, that it excessively narrows the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction and may have a number of drawbacks...|$|R
50|$|Asian {{countries}} often <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> exam-oriented <b>approach</b> in teaching, {{which encourages}} rote memorization. Some {{argue that this}} approach encourages uniformity while eschewing creativity, questioning, student participation, self-determination, autonomy, diversity and critical or independent thinking. Tiger mothers often put children in tutorial classes {{as early as the}} preschool stage. Typically, throughout the child's academic career, the mother's attempts to help the child obtain outstanding results in exams to secure a seat in prestigious schools, with the end goal of entering a top-notch university in mind.|$|R
5000|$|Under Conring's leadership, {{the first}} Deaconess Institute was opened in Frederiksberg's Smallegade on 26 May 1863. Initially, {{there were four}} sisters (nurses) but the {{establishment}} grew quickly, accommodating 63 patients and 17 sisters over the first two years. In 1865, new premises were acquired and in 1873 today's Deaconess Institute building was opened. Conring <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>strict,</b> old-fashioned <b>approach</b> in running the institute, becoming especially difficult in handling male patients. Two of her male colleagues left in protest but she maintained the respect of her female colleagues and toned down her approach on Queen Louise's advice.|$|R
50|$|The Willi Hennig Society {{was founded}} on a {{philosophical}} division among systematic biologists in the late 1970s. A debate created the rift between pheneticists who advocated for statistical or numerical methods that grouped taxa by overall similarity in taxonomy and systematic biologists who <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> cladistic <b>approach</b> to taxonomy, recognizing groups by shared, derived characters alone. The last public clash occurred at the 13th Annual Numerical Taxonomy Conference at the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard University in October 1979. Twelve months later, the Willi Hennig Society was founded through invitation by Professor Edward O. Wiley and founding president James S. Farris. Seventy eight systematists from Great Britain, Sweden, Canada, and the United States gathered at the University of Kansas, to inaugurate the Willi Hennig Society. Membership doubled to over 150 by the second meeting.|$|R
40|$|Big {{banks are}} controversial. Their {{supporters}} maintain that they offer products, services and infrastructure that smaller banks simply cannot match and enjoy unprecedented {{economies of scale}} and scope. Detractors worry about the risks generated by big banks, their threats to financial stability, {{and the way they}} externalize costs of operation to the public. This article explains why there is no conclusive argument {{one way or the other}} and why simple measures for restricting the danger of big banks are neither plausible nor effective. The complex ecology of modern finance and the management and regulatory challenges generated by ultra-large banking, however, cast serious doubt on the proposition that the benefits of big banking outweigh its risks. Consequently, two general principles are proposed for further consideration. First, big banks should bear a greater degree of public accountability by reforming certain principles of corporate governance to require greater representation of public interests at the board and executive levels of big banks. Second, given the unproven promises of performance by big banks, their unimpressive actual record of performance, and the many hazards they inevitably generate or encounter, financial regulators should consciously <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> cautionary <b>approach.</b> Under this approach, big banks would bear a very heavy onus to demonstrate in concrete terms that their continued growth – and even the maintenance of their current scale – can be adequately managed and supervised...|$|R
500|$|In 1996, Alan Vittery {{raised the}} {{question}} of whether the level of detail required by the committee for a description to be acceptable was too high. Similar points were made by Keith Vinicombe and Mike Pennington in 2001. In the light of the rejection of a record of Blyth's reed warbler on Shetland in 1997, Vinicombe and Pennington wrote to British Birds to question the decision. They suggested that the committee was becoming too focussed on minutiae in assessing bird descriptions, ignoring more obvious evidence, Vinicombe saying that [...] "the Committee has prevaricated to the point where it 'cannot see the wood for the trees'". David Walker and Owen Leyshon, David Ferguson, and Andrew Duff have criticised the committee on similar grounds in relation to its approach to the assessment of rare seabirds, citing the Dungeness herald petrel claim as an example. Vittery, and Moss Taylor both expressed concern that BBRC was <b>adopting</b> too <b>strict</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> for records of birds seen only by their finder.|$|R

50|$|Both {{rules were}} more {{aggressive}} variants of similar rule changes later {{made in the}} AFL in 2016: the AFL limited interchanges to ninety per game, and <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>stricter</b> interpretation of deliberate out of bounds without automatically applying it to all untouched disposals out of bounds.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of a brewery, the {{employer}} will be justified in taking <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> disciplinary <b>approach</b> regarding intoxication and the use of alcohol during working hours. <b>A</b> less <b>strict</b> <b>approach</b> to intoxication may be expected from an employer whose employees do not deal directly with the public or who do not work with dangerous machinery.

For this reason, in the teaching process these kinds of lexical items require descriptions instead of providing their Hungarian “equivalents”.
