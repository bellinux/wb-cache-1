The game adjusts which frets are used depending on which Pro model guitar is used, because the Mustang, being only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> smaller than a real guitar, has fewer frets than the Squier real guitar. Some leeway is given on Pro Guitar such as by missing a chord by one offset string.|$|E

He was assumed to be heading for Paris whilst McNab and Mitchel were held prisoners in the Stirling Tolbooth. The court {{documents}} do not mention Shiels however. The crime had been discovered when the grave of Mary Wotherspoon, who had been buried a week before, had been observed to be <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> below the surface.

On his next race, the Tour de Suisse, Sagan sprinted to victory on the hilly stage 1 around Baar. It was a record-breaking 12th victory for the Slovak on the Swiss race. The very next day he won another stage after joining the late breakaway after attacking the reduced peloton at the end of a climb, and outsprinted the pair.|$|E

2500|$|Snails can be bred {{in boxes}} or cages stacked several units high. An {{automatic}} sprinkler {{system can be}} used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.) ...|$|E

The tourists were all agreed upon one thing--one must expect to be cheated at every turn by the Italians. I took an evening walk in Turin, and presently came across a little Punch and Judy show {{in one of the}} great squares. Twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience. This miniature theater was not much bigger than a man's coffin stood on end; the upper part was open and displayed a tinseled parlor--a good-sized handkerchief would have answered for a drop-curtain; the footlights consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> candle-ends <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> long; various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and made long speeches at each other, gesticulating a good deal, and they generally had a fight before they got through. They were worked by strings from above, and the illusion was not perfect, for one saw not only the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated them--and the actors and actresses all talked in the same voice, too. The audience {{stood in front of the}} theater, and seemed to enjoy the performance heartily.|$|R

Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being [...] "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.|$|E
