40|$|Abstract – The {{subthreshold}} {{leakage current}} characteristics of domino logic circuits is evaluated in this paper.

5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam {{investigated}} the periodicity of spore release in M.rotula {{and concluded that}} spore discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms, but rather was dependent on rain. <b>A</b> <b>threshold</b> of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider {{the case in}} which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel {{to the surface and}} an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at <b>a</b> <b>threshold</b> magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E
5|$|Combat is an {{important}} part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering <b>a</b> <b>threshold</b> amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.|$|E
