5|$|<b>An</b> <b>electric</b> current, in {{the form}} of either {{alternating}} current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> current through the tissues, and {{although}} the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>electric</b> field {{generally}} {{varies in}} space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} generates <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> {{field that}} exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Amp√®re-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

40|$|The {{derivation}} of the Maxwell equations is reproduced whereby {{magnetic charges}} are included. This ansatz yields following results: 1) Longitudinal Ampere {{forces in a}} differential magnetostatic force law are improbable. Otherwise <b>a</b> <b>electric</b> current would generate magnetic charges. 2) Simple magnetic and electric induced polarization phenomena are completely analogous and are described by a Laplace equation. 3) Permanent magnetic fields can be understood {{to be caused by}} magnetic charges. Consequently, a moving permanent magnet represents a magnetic current which generates <b>a</b> <b>electric</b> field. 4) The electromagnetic tensors of energy and momentum have some additional terms which are written down generally. 5) If the electric material parameters are influenced by non-electric variables (for instance temperature or pressure), the formalism of electrodynamics is not sufficient to describe the system and has to be completed by further differential equations from the other areas of physics. 6) Nonlinear electro-thermodynamic systems may violate the second law of thermodynamics.

40|$|Acoustic wave {{propagation}} in bulk GaN Semiconductor {{in the presence}} of a slowly changing <b>a.</b> c <b>electric</b> field and <b>a</b> constant <b>electric</b> field has been studied.

Also for <b>a</b> <b>a.</b> c <b>electric</b> field of 4 x 104 V/CM the acoustoelectric gain remains zero until the acoustic wave frequency is about 5. 8 x 1012 Hz then a resonant amplification peak appears.
