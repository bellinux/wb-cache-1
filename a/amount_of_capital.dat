5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued {{to have to pay}} high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E

50|$|The Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem, {{which is}} {{concluded}} from the Heckscher-Ohlin model of international trade, states: trade between countries is {{in proportion to}} their relative <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and labor. In countries with an abundance <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> wage rates tend to be high; therefore, labor-intensive products, e.g. textiles, simple electronics, etc., are more costly to produce internally. In contrast, capital-intensive products, e.g. automobiles, chemicals, etc., are less costly to produce internally. Countries with large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> will export capital-intensive products and import labor-intensive products with the proceeds. Countries with high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> labor will do the reverse.|$|R

If capital is scarce, it has {{a high rate of}} profit. If it is abundant, the profit rate is low. Here is a logical circle. Before the profit rate is determined, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is not measured. This logical difficulty was the subject of academic controversy many years ago—sometimes called the Cambridge Capital Controversies. The conclusion of the controversies was that the concept of homogeneous capital was untenable. Heckscher–Ohlin theorists ignore all these stories without providing any explanation how capital is measured theoretically.|$|E

In 1987, JCP marketed Starrcade as the NWA's answer to WrestleMania. However, the WWF promoted Survivor Series on the same day. The WWF informed cable companies that if they chose to carry Starrcade, they would not be allowed to carry future WWF events. The vast majority of companies showed Survivor Series (only five opted to remain loyal to their contract with Crockett, resulting in only an $80,000 profit after expenses).|$|E
25|$|Sraffa {{suggested}} an aggregation technique (stemming {{in part from}} Marxian economics) by which {{a measure of the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> could be produced: by reducing all machines to a sum of dated labor from different years. A machine produced in the year 2000 can then be treated as the labor and commodity inputs used to produce it in 1999 (multiplied by the rate of profit); and the commodity inputs in 1999 can be further reduced to the labor inputs that made them in 1998 plus the commodity inputs (multiplied by the rate of profit again); and so on until the non-labor component was reduced to a negligible (but non-zero) amount. Then you could add up the dated labor value of a truck to the dated labor value of a laser.|$|E

25|$|Slavery was a {{major cause}} of disunion. Although there were {{opposing}} views even in the Union States, most northern soldiers were largely indifferent on the subject of slavery, while Confederates fought the war, in large measure, to protect southern society, and slavery {{was an integral part of}} it. From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with republicanism. The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was containment—to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction. The slave-holding interests in the South denounced this strategy as infringing upon their Constitutional rights. Southern whites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the South's economy, due to the large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> invested in slaves and fears of integrating the ex-slave black population.|$|E
25|$|Most large {{derivatives}} exchanges operate their own clearing houses, {{allowing them to}} take revenues from post-trade processing as well as trading itself.

Of the big derivatives venues Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ICE and Eurex all clear trades themselves. There is sometimes a division of responsibility between provision of trading facility, and that of clearing and settlement of those trades. Derivative exchanges like the CBOE and LIFFE take responsibility for providing the trading environments, settlement of the resulting trades are usually handled by clearing houses that serve as central counterparties to trades done in the respective exchanges. The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and LCH.Clearnet (London Clearing House) respectively are the clearing corporations for CBOE and LIFFE, although LIFFE and parent NYSE Euronext has long stated its desire to develop its own clearing service.|$|E
25|$|The Medici bank's {{founding}} {{is usually}} dated to 1397, {{since it was}} this year that Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici separated his bank from his nephew Averardo's bank (which had effectively been acting as a branch in Rome), and moved his small bank from Rome to Florence. The branch in Rome was entrusted to Benedetto, and Giovanni took on Gentile di Baldassare Buoni (13711427) as a partner. They raised 10,000 gold florins and began operating in Florence, though Gentile soon left the firm. This move had certain advantages for a bank, inasmuch as the predominant large banks of the 14th century which were based in Florencethe Bardi, Acciaioli, Peruzzihad met with problems, and saw their places usurped by the Alberti, who were just large enough to capture the Catholic Church's business. But the Alberti firm split over internecine quarrels, and the clan was banished from Florence in 1382 (though they {{would be allowed to}} return in 1434), creating yet another void. Giovanni's choice proved to be prescient, especially since what Florence was lacking was a good port on the Mediterraneanwhich it would obtain in 1406 with the conquest of Pisa and its Porto Pisano. A further advantage was that it was much easier to invest a bank's capital in Florence than in Rome, and because of the Holy See's deposits (obtained through Giovanni's long contacts with them), the bank had a fair <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> to invest in other ventures.|$|E
