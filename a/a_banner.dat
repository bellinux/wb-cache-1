5|$|Gotland, {{as a free}} {{republic}} loosely {{associated with}} the Swedish crown, had already borne a ram with <b>a</b> <b>banner</b> (Agnus Dei) as a well-known city seal by 1280.

5|$|On August 8, 2009, a {{photograph}} was taken at a DPJ rally for the House of Representatives election showing <b>a</b> <b>banner</b> that was {{hanging from a}} ceiling.

In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E

5|$|When {{the grade}} of Knight Commander was {{established}} in 1815 the regulations specified that they too should have <b>a</b> <b>banner</b> and stall plate affixed in the chapel. This was never implemented (despite some of the KCBs paying the appropriate fees) primarily {{due to lack of}} space, although the 1847 statutes allow all three classes to request the erection of a plate in the chapel bearing the member's name, date of nomination, and (for the two higher classes) optionally the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days.

When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like <b>a</b> <b>banner).</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), <b>a</b> <b>banner</b> of the Commonwealth was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with {{the arms of the}} Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started to be used for the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes of red and white.|$|E

In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and <b>a</b> <b>banner.</b> She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
