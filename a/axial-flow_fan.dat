40|$|Attenuation of {{ducted fan}} noise remains a {{technical}} {{challenge in the}} low frequency range as traditional duct lining becomes ineffective. This study proposes a reactive method to suppress the sound radiation from an <b>axial-flow</b> <b>fan.</b> The method is particularly effective in the low frequency region and covers a broad band. Its effect is derived from two mechanisms. One is {{the reduction in the}} confining effects of duct walls when the duct radius is increased; the other is the acoustic interference between the direct radiation from the fan and reflections by the duct junctions. This interference is always destructive for axial dipoles when the frequency approaches zero. This performance differs from normal passive control methods, which become totally ineffective toward zero frequency. An approximate plane-wave theory explains the essential physics of the method, and its quantitative prediction is found to agree well with a full numerical simulation using a spectral method of Chebyshev collocation. The latter is validated by experiment using an <b>axial-flow</b> <b>fan</b> in a duct of finite length. Broadband noise reduction is achieved while the flow speed is kept unchanged.

The three-dimensional, unsteady flow field is calculated using FLUENT?, and the sound radiation predicted by acoustic analogy is compared with measurement data. Striking differences are found between the pressure oscillations {{in various parts of}} the structural surfaces during an interaction event. The suction surface of the blade experiences a sudden increase in pressure when the blade trailing edge sweeps past a strut, while the process of pressure decrease on the pressure side of the blade is rather gradual during the interaction. The contribution of the latter towards the total thrust force on the structure is cancelled out significantly by that on the strut. In terms of the acoustic contributions from the rotor and strut, the upstream rotor dominates and this feature differs from the usual rotor-stator interaction acoustics in which the downstream part is responsible for most of the noise.

The authors conducted an experimental study to investigate the inception patterns of rotating stall evolution at different rotor blade stagger-angle settings with the aim of speculating on stable operating margin.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel stall-detection methodology for low-speed <b>axial-flow</b> <b>fans.</b> Because aerodynamic stall is a major potential cause of mechanical failure in axial fans, effective stall-detection techniques have had wide application for many years. However, aerodynamic stall does not always result in mechanical failure. A subsonic fan can sometimes operate at low speeds in an aerodynamically stalled condition without incurring mechanical failure. To differentiate between aerodynamic stall conditions that constitute a mechanical risk and those that do not, the stall-detection methodology in the present study utilizes a symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) technique that is capable of differentiating between stall conditions. This paper describes a stall-detections criterion based on a SDP visual waveform analysis and develops a stall-warning methodology based on that analysis. This study presents an analysis of measured acoustic and structural data across nine aerodynamic operating conditions represented in a 3 X 3 matrix. The matrix is a combination of (i) three speeds (full-, half-, and quarter-speed) and (ii) three operational states (stable operation, incipient stall, and rotating stall). The matrix of SDPs and structural data are used to differentiate critical stall conditions (those that will lead to mechanical failure of the fan) from noncritical ones (those that will not result in mechanical failure), thus providing a basis for an intelligent stall-warning methodology...|$|R

To go further in the comparison, we also studied the wall pressure fluctuations at the casing wall in another normalized test bench, for two flow rates corresponding to the maximum efficiencies of the two fans. The total level of fluctuations is lower for the thick blades fan that for the thin blades fan, which is counter-intuitive.
