40|$|We {{develop the}} first steps towards an {{analysis}} of geometry on the quantum spacetime proposed in [1]. The homogeneous elements of the universal differential algebra are naturally identified with operators living in tensor powers of Quantum Spacetime; this allows us to compute their spectra. In particular, we consider operators that {{can be interpreted as}} distances, areas, 3 - and 4 -volumes. The Minkowski distance operator between two independent events is shown to have pure Lebesgue spectrum with infinite multiplicity. The Euclidean distance operator is shown to have spectrum bounded below by a constant of the order of the Planck length. The corresponding statement is proved also for both the space-space and space-time area operators, {{as well as for the}} Euclidean length of the vector representing the 3 -volume operators. However, the space 3 -volume operator (the time component of that vector) is shown to have spectrum equal to the whole complex plane. All these operators are normal, while the distance operators are also selfadjoint. The Lorentz invariant spacetime volume operator, representing the 4 - volume spanned by five independent events, is shown to be normal. Its spectrum is pure point with a finite distance (of the order of the fourth power of the Planck length) away from the origin. The mathematical formalism apt to these problems is developed and its relation to a general formulation of Gauge Theories on Quantum Spaces is outlined. As a byproduct, a Hodge Duality between the absolute dif- ferential and the Hochschild boundary is pointed out. Comment: 23 pages, one figure with colours, <b>active</b> <b>hyperlink...</b>|$|E

40|$|Pharmacological {{challenge}} imaging has mapped, {{but rarely}} quantified, {{the sensitivity of}} a biological system to a given drug. We describe a novel method called rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging. This method combines pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, repeated small doses of a challenge drug over a short time scale, and functional imaging to rapidly provide quantitative estimates of drug sensitivity including EC 50 (the concentration of drug that produces half the maximum possible effect). We first test the method with simulated data, assuming a typical sigmoidal dose-response curve and assuming imperfect imaging that includes artifactual baseline signal drift and random error. With these few assumptions, rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging reliably estimates EC 50 from the simulated data, except when noise overwhelms the drug effect or when the effect occurs only at high doses. In preliminary fMRI studies of primate brain using a dopamine agonist, the observed noise level is modest compared with observed drug effects, and a quantitative EC 50 {{can be obtained from}} some regional time-signal curves. Taken together, these results suggest that research and clinical applications for rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging are realistic. Comment: 26 pages total, 4 tables, 10 figures.

40|$|Whereas many {{applications}} of {{natural language processing}} for molecular biology focus on protein name tagging for the purpose high-level information extraction from large corpuses of scientific text, such as automatic identification of protein-protein interactions, high quality protein name tagging has a value in itself. The {{aim of this study}} was to design, implement, and evaluate a high-accuracy protein name tagger, and give proof-of-concept for some of the most basic applications of protein name tagging in an information retrieval setting, namely browsing support, active database cross linking, and enhanced query functionality. A combination of heuristics, dictionary look-up, syntactic analysis, and the application of a local dynamic dictionary were used to create a protein name tagger. This tagger outperforms a previously published similar system when benchmarked on a corpus of manually annotated Medline abstracts. In addition to evaluating the tagging performance, the implemented algorithm was used to add mark-up to a corpus of approximately 10000 Medline abstracts, which were indexed in a state-of-the-art information retrieval system. Indexing highlights many basic benets of adding named entity mark-up such as protein names. One obvious benet is that the search process is enhanced by the addition of a search eld. Furthermore, the mark-up can be used for providing <b>active</b> <b>hyperlinks</b> between protein entities in presented documents and protein sequence databases, such as SwissProt, when both databases are indexed in the same information retrieval system. Efficient links can also be constructed in the opposite direction providing high precision retrieval of documents relevant for protein entries. Fast and accurate cross linking can be obtained by using an efficient implementation of the eld based approximate cosine measure, which is a simple standard information retrieval technique for document similarity searching.
