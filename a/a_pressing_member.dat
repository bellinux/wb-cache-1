50|$|Parliamentary immunity, {{also known}} as {{legislative}} immunity, is {{a system in which}} members of the parliament or legislature are granted partial immunity from prosecution. Before prosecuting, it is necessary that the immunity be removed, usually by a superior court of justice or by the parliament itself. This reduces the possibility of <b>pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the parliament to change his or her vote by fear of prosecution.|$|R

30|$|Each {{sugarcane}} bagasse particle (containing both pith and rind) {{and recycled}} chip (mainly consisting of softwood) was screened by a sieving machine, and the remains between aperture sizes of 5.9 and 0.9 mm {{were used as}} materials. The particles were dried in an oven at 80  °C until the moisture content reached approximately 2 – 3  %. Materials were then hand-formed into homogeneous single-layer mats using a forming box. The mats were hot-pressed under <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> temperature of 200, 220, 240, 260, or 280  °C and <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> time of 10  min. The target density for the board was 0.8  g/cm 3, and the board dimensions were 300  ×  300  ×  9  mm. Bagasse particleboard and recycled chip particleboard {{with the addition of}} 8  wt% PMDI resin were manufactured as references under <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> temperature of 200  °C, <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> time of 10  min and a target density of 0.8  g/cm 3.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} confinement condition on the damage induced by a spherical impact, an experimental setup that can impact contact pressure to the specimen through <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> die was composed. The steel and the WC balls in 3 mm diameter impacted to the soda-lime glass specimen with dimension of 33 × 33 × 8 m in the impact velocity range of 30 m/s to 200 m/s. Three different conditions are given for the impact damage investigation, which are the case without <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> die and the cases of p= 0 MPa and p= 200 MPa with <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> die. The stress distribution in the glass specimen by impacting the particle was also evaluated using MARC s/w system. The particle impact produced various kinds of the damage such as the ring and the cone cracks, the radial cracks and the craters. The contact pressure applied to the specimen changed stress fields in the specimen. The damage zones of the specimen without <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> die increased as the impact velocity increased. The damage extents in the specimen with the contact pressure of 200 MPa were reduced as compared with the case of those without <b>a</b> <b>pressing</b> die...|$|R
