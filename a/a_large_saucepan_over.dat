60|$|The men who officiated as cooks--and who, by agreement, {{had been}} {{released}} from all night duty in consideration of their regularly undertaking that occupation--now brought in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> full of soup; and each man went up with his canteen, and received his portion, returning to his bed upon the straw to eat it.|$|R
50|$|Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 by 9 in baking pan. In <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>saucepan,</b> combine 1 {{cup white}} sugar, 2 cups {{firmly packed brown}} sugar, 2 cups water, 1 cup shortening, 4 cups {{seedless}} raisins, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 2 tsp salt. Boil together for 3 minutes, then cool.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} to local recipes for its preparation but basically {{the meat and}} rind are boiled with salt, then minced and mixed with finely ground green cabbage. Fresh blood is added together with breadcrumbs and the mixture is put into intestine casings. The sausages are then boiled for 15 minutes in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> until cooked.|$|R
50|$|The dish {{is a basic}} white stew {{made with}} a few simple {{ingredients}}: skirts, kidneys, onions, thyme, salt, white pepper, water, and potatoes. All the ingredients are placed in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> of boiling water and slowly simmered for about two hours. At the end of cooking, if necessary, a little cornflour (cornstarch) mixed as a slurry with a little water can be stirred in as thickening.|$|R

The name pinnekjøtt (literally: stick meat) is disputed. It may refer to the birch twigs of the cooking process, but the word 'pinne' is in dialectal Norwegian also used in reference to single ribs - akin to [...] "rib sticks", a dialectal expression in English.|$|R

60|$|Entering {{one morning}} after the {{delivery}} of a telegram which had cost him a pretty long walk, Phil proceeded to the boys' hall, and took his seat {{at the end of}} the row of boys who were awaiting their turn to be called for mercurial duty. Observing a very small telegraph-boy in a scullery off the hall, engaged in some mysterious operations with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>saucepan,</b> from which volumes of steam proceeded, he went towards him. By that time Phil had become pretty well acquainted with the faces of his comrades, but this boy he had not previously met with. The lad was stooping over a sink, and carefully holding in the contents of the pan with its lid, while he strained off the boiling water.|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen was}} full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob <b>a</b> <b>large</b> black <b>saucepan</b> steamed slowly.

60|$|At {{the hour}} I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the {{afternoon}} sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro {{in one of their}} most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view {{of the back of the}} tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority--my accomplishments and my function--in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch's broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out <b>a</b> <b>large</b> clean <b>saucepan.</b> This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.|$|R
6000|$|Behind {{the corps}} {{followed}} the cart; loaded with the stores of the corps, {{a considerable amount}} of ammunition, two or three cases of gun cotton for blowing up bridges, several small barrels of powder, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> quantity of fine iron wire, three or four crowbars, bags of coffee and rice, and a keg of brandy, four kettles and as many <b>large</b> <b>saucepans,</b> together with all sorts of odds and ends. By the side of the horse walked Tim Doyle; dressed in the uniform of the corps, but without the equipments, and with a long blouse worn over his tunic. He was, in fact, already enrolled as {{an active member of the}} corps. This was done, in the first place, at his own earnest request; and upon the plea that thus only could he escape the chance of being seized as a spy, whenever he might for a moment be separated from the corps; and also that, unless he had a uniform like the rest, how could he take any vacancy in the ranks, even when it should occur? ...|$|R
50|$|A bread-like dish {{similar to}} the calentita. Sharing its Italian origins, it is a {{descendant}} of the Genoese dish with the same name. Unlike calentita the ingredients are first simmered in a <b>saucepan</b> for <b>over</b> an hour, stirring constantly, to form a paste which is then left to set. When the polenta-like dough is set, it is cut into small strips and fried in olive oil.|$|R

60|$|Poor Charley, I {{wonder what}} could have {{made me think of}} him in {{connection}} with heroes; his lovableness, I suppose--certainly not his heroic qualities. I can recall his boyish face now (it was always a boyish face), the tears streaming down it as he sat in the schoolyard beside a bucket, in which he was drowning three white mice and a tame rat. I sat down opposite and cried too, while helping him to hold a <b>saucepan</b> lid <b>over</b> the poor little creatures, and thus there sprang up a friendship between us, which grew.|$|R
60|$|The men's {{weapons were}} {{fastened}} round {{one of the}} poles {{to keep them from}} the damp night air. Ostik had at once set to work on landing, leaving the Houssas to pitch the tent. A fire was soon blazing and a kettle and <b>saucepans</b> suspended <b>over</b> it. Rice was served out to the men, with the addition of some salt meat, of which sufficient had been purchased from the captain of the brig to last throughout the journey in the canoe. The men were all in high spirits at this addition to their fare, which was more than had been bargained for, and their songs rose merrily round the fire in the night air.|$|R
