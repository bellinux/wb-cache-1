5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited <b>another</b> <b>subject</b> chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} accommodation in {{the region}} of Třeboň and its cooperation with <b>another</b> <b>subjects</b> providing services in tourism. The theoretical part deals with the description of this region and accommodation services. It describes the division of accommodation and also the management of destination. The analytical part investigates the cooperation of subjects providing accommodation services with <b>another</b> <b>subjects</b> providing services for tourists and its influens on their effective business running. The results of this research confirm the impact of this cooperation. The aim of this thesis is to focus on problematical parts of the cooperation in tourism in this region and propose new possibilities of tourism and service development...|$|R

25|$|Christ taking {{leave of}} his Mother is <b>another</b> <b>subject</b> with similar origins in late medieval meditational literature.

50|$|In neuroimaging, spatial {{normalization}} is {{an image}} processing step, more specifically an image registration method.

25|$|Madhva {{differed}} significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to {{his concept of}} eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation (Mukti-yogyas), <b>another</b> <b>subject</b> to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hell or Andhatamas (Tamo-yogyas).|$|E
25|$|Many writers {{chose to}} write about the New Deal, and whether they were for or against it, and if it was helping the country out. Some of these writers were Ruth McKenney, Edmund Wilson, and Scott Fitzgerald. <b>Another</b> <b>subject</b> that was very popular for novelists was the {{condition}} of labor.

25|$|Invariant {{theory of}} {{infinite}} groups is inextricably {{linked with the}} development of linear algebra, especially, the theories of quadratic forms and determinants. <b>Another</b> <b>subject</b> with strong mutual influence is projective geometry, where invariant theory can be used to organize the subject, and during the 1960s, new life was breathed into the subject by David Mumford in the form of his geometric invariant theory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>subject</b> is {{the meeting}} of the infant Jesus with his cousin, the infant John the Baptist, who, {{according}} to legend was rescued from Bethlehem before the massacre by the Archangel Uriel, and joined the Holy Family in Egypt.

She said Waldron told her that those concerns were not shared, to which she responded that she would research that.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>subject</b> is almen studieforberedelse. The {{purpose of}} that subject is to {{introduce}} the student to a three main areas of study the gymnasium deals with: the humanities, social science and natural science. Furthermore, does it aim to give a student knowledge about different methodology used by different faculties. Lessons encompass a combination {{of two or more}} of the student's other subjects (e.g. Danish, history and physics). The student will learn to use the methodology theory it has learned to work with and solve complex problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>subject</b> given 4mg {{complained of}} “chest oppression” and that “a load is {{pressing}} {{down from above}} and my body feels heavy.” The subject also reported “numbness of the entire body” and “a pleasant Martini feeling-my body is taking charge of my mind”. The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, {{as if he were}} looking through a lens filter.|$|E

25|$|In the Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance (1959), the {{investigators}} Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith {{asked students to}} spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with <b>another</b> <b>subject</b> (an actor), and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. One group of subjects were paid twenty dollars ($20); a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and the control group were not asked {{to speak with the}} imposter-subject.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medical schools}} offer {{graduate}} entry programmes, which are four years long. The name {{refers to the}} fact that students on these courses already have a degree in <b>another</b> <b>subject</b> (i.e. they are graduates). Due to the shorter length of the course, the timetable of these degrees are more intense and the holidays are shorter, compared to students on the 5-year course. In terms of entrance requirements, the 4-year degree restricts entry to those who already hold a first degree, and have previously worked in an area of healthcare. The first degree doesn't necessarily have to be a BSc degree (this is the criteria for some of the medical schools), whereas other medical schools specify that the prior degree has to be in a science subject. Competition for this course is fierce, with students having to also sit an entrance exam prior to being considered for an interview.|$|E
25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with <b>another</b> <b>subject.</b> For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|We provide {{experimental}} evidence on how unequal access to performance enhancing education affects demand for redistribution. People earn {{money in a}} real effort experiment and can then decide how to distribute it among themselves and <b>another</b> <b>subjects.</b> We compare situations in which randomly chosen people get access to performance enhancing education with situations in which either only luck or only performance determines outcome. We find that unequal opportunities evoke a preference for redistribution that {{is comparable to the}} situation when luck alone determines the allocation. However, people with unequal access to education are more likely to disagree about the appropriate distribution. Distribution, Inequality of opportunities, Negotiation, Education, Experiment...|$|R
40|$|Mental files, in Recanati's framework, {{function}} as 'singular {{terms in the}} language of thought'; they serve to think about objects in the world (and to store information about them). But they have a derived, metarepresentational function : they serve to represent how other subjects think about objects in the world. To account for the metarepresentational use of files, Recanati introduces the notion of an 'indexed file', i. e. a vicarious file that stands, in the <b>subject's</b> mind, for <b>another</b> <b>subject's</b> file about an object. Using that notion, he argues, one can provide an analysis of attitude ascriptions and the conniving use of empty singular terms...|$|R
