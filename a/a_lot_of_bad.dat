IGN's Meghan Sullivan was also fairly negative, saying that Zero's character, interactions and motivation were badly let down by poor writing. USGamer's Kat Bailey was generally unenthusiastic about Zero's general attitude and portrayal, saying that she was [...] "characterized in large part by her apparent love of killing and her aggressive bitchiness toward her companion dragon". Roger Hargreaves for Metro agreed, finding Zero to be a [...] "thoroughly unpleasant and unlikeable main character." [...] Crunchyroll's Nate Ming was highly critical of Zero, calling her [...] "a ruthless, backstabbing, front-stabbing, cold-hearted bitch", and said that she would be the villain in any other game.|$|E
500|$|... "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V.

Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that it shared similar themes with the direction the series would take in its second season. Gibron described the episode as [...] "spooky and somewhat surreal", adding that [...] "the entire installment [...] crackles with possibilities". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] four stars out of five, describing it as being [...] "surprising, intriguing, moody and pretentious". Shearman compared the episode thematically to Mann's earlier script for [...] "The Judge", and noted that while the story [...] "doesn't make for an especially comprehensible yarn, it does produce an episode that is genuinely uneasy viewing".|$|E
500|$|In 1880, an Australian side captained by Billy Murdoch toured England. The {{tourists}} {{had difficulty}} finding good opponents; most county sides turned them down, although Yorkshire played two unofficial matches against them. There was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> will, {{exacerbated by the}} Australians' arrival in England at short notice, to some extent unexpectedly. [...] This was heightened by an English perception that the Australians came frequently to maximise their profits; at the time, professionalism was frowned upon. [...] In his autobiography Lord Harris wrote, [...] "They asked no-one's goodwill in the matter, and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements; {{and the result was}} they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised ... We felt we had to make a protest against too frequent visits". Harris initially shunned the team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them. An attempt to arrange a game against an English XI for the Cricketers' Fund was turned down, and public advertisements in the newspapers were shunned. W.G. Grace was sympathetic to the Australians and felt that they were not to blame for the riot. He attempted to arrange a game for them at Lord's, but was rebuffed by the Marylebone Cricket Club, who gave the excuse that the ground was not available.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, the {{ownership}} of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music for Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and Still Life was released on October 18, 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. Still Life was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called Still Life a [...] "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." [...] As explained by Åkerfeldt, Still Life is a concept album: [...] "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith {{as the rest of}} the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back... <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> things start happening." ...|$|E

She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1902–03, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with Lord Hawke's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand {{representative}} side, and in all matches scored 148 runs {{at an average of}} 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention. [...] In one game, Charles Bannerman, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: [...] "When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet is in it. He bowls <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets." [...] However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it {{looked as if he had}} bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: [...] "You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that." [...] Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.|$|E

The tone of the artwork for Ten Love Songs, as well as its singles, done by artist Grady McFerrin also did not match that of the actual music on the album, which Sundfør said [...] "brought an interesting element to the record" [...] by creating another [...] "world or dimension" [...] for it.|$|R
