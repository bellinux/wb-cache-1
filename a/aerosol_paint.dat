25|$|<b>Aerosol</b> <b>paint,</b> {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, <b>aerosol</b> <b>paint</b> leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented <b>aerosol</b> <b>paint,</b> which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|E

The review is an updated edition of one initially published by the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal and Tropical Health as Petrol Sniffing in Aboriginal Communities: a Review of Interventions (d’Abbs & MacLean, 2000). Whereas the earlier review was restricted in scope to petrol sniffing, the updated review covers other forms of VSM such as inhalation of <b>aerosol</b> <b>paints,</b> and other settings besides remote Indigenous communities...|$|R

50|$|A {{mixture of}} {{aliphatic}} and alicyclic C7 to C12 hydrocarbons, white spirit {{is used as}} an extraction solvent, as a cleaning solvent, as a degreasing solvent and as a solvent in <b>aerosols,</b> <b>paints,</b> wood preservatives, lacquers, varnishes, and asphalt products. In western Europe about 60% of the total white spirit consumption is used in paints, lacquers and varnishes. White spirit is {{the most widely used}} solvent in the paint industry. In households, white spirit is commonly used to clean paint brushes after use, to clean auto parts and tools, as a starter fluid for charcoal grills, to remove adhesive residue from non-porous surfaces, and many other common tasks.|$|R

5000|$|Glycol ethers {{are either}} [...] "e-series" [...] or [...] "p-series" [...] glycol ethers, {{depending}} on whether they are made from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, respectively. Typically, e-series glycol ethers are found in pharmaceuticals, sunscreens, cosmetics, inks, dyes and water based paints, while p-series glycol ethers are used in degreasers, cleaners, <b>aerosol</b> <b>paints</b> and adhesives. Both E-series glycol ethers and P-series glycol ethers {{can be used as}} intermediates that undergo further chemical reactions, producing glycol diethers and glycol ether acetates. P-series glycol ethers are marketed as having lower toxicity than the E-series. Most glycol ethers are water-soluble, biodegradable and only a few are considered toxic.|$|R
40|$|Spray {{painters}} {{are potentially}} exposed to aerosol containing Cr(VI) via inhalation of chromate-based paint spray. Two field studies were conducted at an aerospace facility {{to determine the}} size distribution and speciation of Cr(VI) in <b>paint</b> spray <b>aerosol.</b> Sampled <b>paint</b> products consisted of sparingly soluble strontium chromate in an epoxy resin matrix, a matrix generally known for its durability and toughness. Personal aerosol samples were collected using Sierra Marple personal cascade impactors and analyzed for Cr(VI) and total Cr. The size distribution of total Cr particles in the <b>paint</b> <b>aerosol</b> had a Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) of 7. 5 mm [Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD = 2. 7 mm) ] in both field studies. The MMAD of Cr(VI) particles was 8. 5 mm (GSD = 2. 2 mm). Particles> 2 mm constituted 90 % {{or more of the}} total Cr and the Cr(VI) mass, in all sampled <b>paint</b> <b>aerosols</b> and were lognormally distributed. The target site for respiratory deposition of Cr in the aerosol was estimated based on the mass distribution of Cr according to particle size. On an average, 62 % of the Cr and Cr(VI) mass in the <b>paint</b> <b>aerosol</b> consisted of particles> 10 mm. This study showed that 71. 8 % of Cr(VI) mass in <b>paint</b> spray <b>aerosol</b> potentially inhaled by a spray painter may deposit in the head airways region.

5000|$|In 1999 Soto took a {{break from}} all <b>aerosol</b> <b>painting,</b> citing health reasons, boredom with the {{limitations}} of the spray can and conflict among graffiti writers. Ten years later in London, Soto visited artists D*Face and Word To Mother. Seeing their work in person inspired Soto to begin painting on walls again. Since then, Soto has reconnected with his graffiti roots and painted murals in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Miami, London and Paris. In 2010 he participated in the Underbelly Project, an illegal art gallery beneath the city of New York. In 2011 he completed his largest wall painting to date- [...] "Les Chat Terrible" [...] in Lyon, France. Soto claims he is not a graffiti writer or street artist, rather he calls himself “a muralist with an occasional urge to do some graf”.|$|R

50|$|Unauthorized {{graffiti}} {{is considered}} to be vandalism in most jurisdictions mainly because the work or display is done without permission of the property owner. The term 'aerosol art' is commonly used for displaying art form 'with' permission of the property owner. The UK and many cities in the United States prohibit the sale of <b>aerosol</b> <b>paint</b> to minors as part of graffiti abatement programs. While major industrial and consumer <b>aerosol</b> <b>paint</b> companies like Krylon and Rust-Oleum actively participate in anti-graffiti programs, art-brand companies are often supportive of writers and graffiti culture, though most do not endorse illegal writing.|$|E

50|$|Methylene {{chloride}} can {{be found}} in adhesive removers and <b>aerosol</b> spray <b>paints.</b> In the human body, methylene chloride is metabolized to carbon monoxide. If a product that contains methylene chloride needs to be used the best way to protect human health is to use the product outdoors. If it must be used indoors, proper ventilation will help to keep exposure levels down. In the United States, methylene chloride is listed as exempt from VOC status.|$|R

50|$|Smrt's {{most notable}} {{invention}} is the upside-down <b>aerosol</b> spray <b>paint</b> can: {{a can of}} spray paint {{that can be applied}} while holding the can upside down (which is impossible with typical spray paint cans). This is widely used in municipal and highway applications for outlining parking lots, turn lanes, center lines, crosswalks, etc. They are also commonly used for painting hashmarks and lines on athletic fields. His patents date back to 1977 and include paint application devices, vacuum sealed packing materials, geodesic domes, and mechanical arms.|$|R

He was previously the owner of Fox Valley Systems, a company that marketed his spray paint applicators, however he sold the company to his sons in 2006 (the company closed in 2013 after an industrial accident and was subsequently bought out by competitor ARC Sporting Goods). He is also known for breeding rare Shire horses (helping to increase their overall population from just 50 horses when he began), and for opening the short-lived Shireland theme park.|$|R
