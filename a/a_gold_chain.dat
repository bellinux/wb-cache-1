In recognition of their bravery, on 26 July 1875, the Governor of South Australia, Sir Anthony Musgrave, presented passengers James Fitzgerald and John Cleland and crewman Robert Brazil with gold medals and a gold watch. The Gothenburg Relief Fund Committee also presented each of them with <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following Tiberius' {{death and}} the {{ascension}} of Agrippa's friend Caligula in 37, Agrippa was set free and made king of the territories of Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Batanaea, and Trachonitis, which his uncle Philip the Tetrarch had held, {{with the addition of}} Abila. Agrippa was also awarded the ornamenta praetoria and could use the title amicus caesaris ("friend of Caesar"). Caligula also presented him with <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> equal in weight to the iron one he had worn in prison, which Agrippa dedicated to the Temple of Jerusalem on his return to his ancestral homeland. In 39, Agrippa returned to Rome, and brought about the banishment of his uncle, Herod Antipas; he was then granted his uncle's tetrarchy, consisting of Galilee and Peraea. This created a Jewish kingdom which did not include Judea at its center.|$|E
25|$|St. Paul's Chapel in New York City {{has a large}} oil {{painting}} of the national coat of arms, believed installed sometime in 1786. It was commissioned on October 7, 1785, {{not long after the}} Congress of the Confederation began meeting in nearby Federal Hall. The painting hangs over Washington's pew, across the room from a painting of the arms of New York over the Governor's pew. The painting has many similarities to Trenchard's version (or vice versa depending on which came first), including the random placement of stars and details of the eagle. The clouds are in a full circle, though, instead of an arc, and the rays extend beyond them in all directions. The shield has <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> border with a badge at the bottom. This is the earliest known full-color version of the seal design, and the artist is unknown.|$|E

25|$|At Framlingham Castle the Duke kept two silver-gilt cups {{engraved}} with {{the arms of}} James IV, which he bequeathed to Cardinal Wolsey in 1524. The Duke's descendants presented the College of Arms with a sword, a dagger and a turquoise ring in 1681. The family tradition was either that these items belonged to James IV or were arms carried by Thomas Howard at Flodden. The sword blade is signed by the maker Maestre Domingo of Toledo. There is some doubt whether the weapons are of the correct period. The Earl of Arundel was painted by Philip Fruytiers, following Anthony van Dyck's 1639 composition, with his ancestor's sword, gauntlet and helm from Flodden. Thomas Lord Darcy retrieved a powder flask belonging to James IV {{and gave it to}} Henry VIII. A cross with rubies and sapphires with <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> worn by James and a hexagonal table-salt with the figure of St Andrews on the lid were given to Henry by James Stanley, Bishop of Ely.|$|E

He was also the host of Card Player's now defunct online video segment, [...] "The Mouthpiece."

While it was moderately successful in the United Kingdom, and reached number 12 on the UK Singles chart, it was a commercial disappointment in Australia and only managed to peak at number 69 on the singles chart. In the United States, the song peaked at {{number one on the}} Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The accompanying music video, directed by AlexandLiane, features Minogue, and a number of male models, performing various dance routines wearing <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> mini dress, a red silk mini trench and an LBD.|$|E

Shaftesbury had fallen hard for a 29-year-old French model named Nathalie Lions. In 2006, {{an article in}} the Guardian wrote of his relationship with Lions, with whom he would be found [...] "frolicking at Bellini's bar in Kensington, where he liberally wrote cheques and Lions spent them". He refused to listen to others who warned him that she was taking advantage of him. They toured the party spots of London, Barbados, and the Riviera until a tabloid exposé revealed Lions' past as a [...] "Penthouse Pet" [...] for Penthouse magazine and Shaftesbury called off the relationship. Rather than return to England, he remained on the French Riviera.|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{told that}} getting the cats to {{cooperate}} {{was a difficult}} step. She told MTV: [...] "They were definitely the most diva out of anybody. Those cats were mad. We had animal trainers, but you really can't train a cat." [...] To get the effect of Knowles riding the cat, Matsoukas used a large plastic cow covered in a black fur drape for Knowles to perform on. The video was originally going to be its own music video {{as seen in the}} behind the scenes of B'Day Anthology with Knowles wearing more outfits and shooting more scenes than shown. It begins with Knowles showing cat-like eyes with leopard print make-up and fashion on. In some parts of the clip, Knowles plays with an oversized ball of pink yarn and later plays with an oversized black cat. The clip ends with Knowles pulling the oversized cat on <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> off set and just immediately after that, the music video for [...] "Green Light" [...] begins. Rohin Guha of BlackBook magazine described the video as [...] "deplorable". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "pure camp". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number five on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, writing [...] "It's Beyoncé running aorund with a giant cat!

2500|$|The {{wearing of}} signet rings (from Latin [...] "signum" [...] meaning sign) {{goes back to}} ancient Egypt; the {{distinctive}} personal signature was not developed in antiquity and most documents needed a seal.

2500|$|As college {{students}} across America began demanding [...] "two, three, many Columbias," [...] Jacobs became a recognized national leader of SDS {{and looked to}} by those who saw violence {{as the only way}} to respond to the governing political and economic system of the day.

[...] The business was duly passed on to Alderman Francis Allen, a regicide and goldsmith. As before when in favour, Mackworth seems to have used the opportunity to extract more money for his hard-pressed garrison: the Council of State assured him it would honour a £100 bill for contingent expenses. Mackworth was quick {{to spend the money}} and it was ordered paid on 19 September. The Scots had moved on and were soundly defeated on 3 September by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Pharaoh told Joseph that {{in as much}} as God had shown him all this, there was none so {{discreet}} and wise as Joseph, and thus Pharaoh set Joseph over all the land of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Joseph his signet ring, fine linen, <b>a</b> <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> about his neck, and his second chariot, and had people cry before him [...] "Abrech." [...] And Pharaoh renamed Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On to be his wife. Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and in the seven years of plenty he gathered up grain as plentiful as the sand of the sea. Joseph and Asenath had two sons, the first of whom Joseph called Manasseh, for God had made him forget all his toil and all his father's house, and the second of whom he called Ephraim, for God had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction.

[...] " [...] In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s.
