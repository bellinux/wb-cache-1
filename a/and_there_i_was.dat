For so long women have been told that there are certain ways they mustn't look if they want to get ahead in life. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dressing in a forbidden way and yet obviously in charge of my life. It was then I realized why were all of them out there in their seats, dressing like me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{also began}} a regular warm-up spot for BBC Televisions Top of the Pops, {{transmitted}} from Manchester. He recalled: [...] "There was one strange {{moment when the}} Yardbirds appeared on the show doing 'For Your Love', which was a song that I'd written. Everyone clamoured around them – <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just part of an anonymous group. I felt strange that night, hearing them play my song." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child Clark sang in {{the chapel}} choir and showed a talent for mimicry, impersonating Vera Lynn, Carmen Miranda and Sophie Tucker for her family and friends. Her father {{introduced}} her to theatre when {{he took her to}} see Flora Robson in a 1938 production of Mary Stuart; she later recalled that after the performance [...] "I made up my mind then <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be an actress. ... I wanted to be Ingrid Bergman more than anything else in the world." [...] However, her first public performances were as a singer, performing with an orchestra in the entrance hall of Bentall's Department Store in Kingston upon Thames for a tin of toffee and a gold wristwatch, in 1939.|$|E

"Then mankind is {{generally}} spared the greatest pain," [...] she replied, [...] "for I apprehend {{few people are}} sensible of death--unless indeed," [...] she added, [...] "it be {{on the field of}} battle; <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure, it cannot be painful." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dor. I {{think you}} in so ill a condition, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{resolved}} {{to pray for}} you, this very evening, in the close walk behind the terrace; for that's a private place, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure nobody will disturb my devotions. And so, good-night, sir. [...] [Exit.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is him, Margot. He {{has come}} from my father. Now we are to do what I told you about. We are to go off tonight under his charge, to your mother's, my dear old nurse, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to live with you, and be as your cousin, till papa can {{get me out of}} the country." ...|$|R
2500|$|Meir {{was one of}} 24 signatories (including two women) of the Israeli Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948. She later recalled, [...] "After I signed, I cried. When I studied American {{history as}} a schoolgirl and I read about those who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence, I couldn't imagine these were real people doing {{something}} real. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting down and signing a declaration of establishment." [...] Israel was attacked the next day by the joint armies of neighboring countries in what became the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the war, Israel stopped the combined Arab assault, and then it launched a series of military offensives to defeat the invading Arab armies and to end the war.|$|E
2500|$|Soros was 13 {{years old}} in March 1944 when Nazi Germany {{occupied}} Hungary. Jewish children were barred from attending school by the Nazis, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made {{to report to the}} Judenrat ("Jewish Council") which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: [...] "The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> given these small slips of paper.... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, [...] "You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported." ...|$|E
60|$|So in I went. Mother Goose herself {{opened the}} door, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Our lands were {{touched upon}} the {{northern}} side {{by those of}} a house with which we had been at feud for two hundred years and more. Puritans they were, stern and haughty in their ungodly righteousness. They held us dissolute because we enjoyed the life that God had given us, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> told the hatred first began.|$|R
60|$|At Eton he {{was called}} Miss Crawley; <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry to say, his younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently. But though his parts were not brilliant, he made up for his lack of talent by meritorious industry, and was never known, during eight years at school, {{to be subject to}} that {{punishment}} which it is generally thought none but a cherub can escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{just how}} it took me," [...] said another. [...] "'Lord,' I says, 'here's Judgement Day!' <b>and</b> then <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{sprawling}} among the flies...." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{pleasure}} {{his words}} gave me, I could not--can never--express. Then <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> his slave for ever.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{startled to}} see what I took to be a wild man, with unkempt beard and ragged hair, {{pursuing}} a giant butterfly with brilliant wings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yer oughter {{seen how}} mad he looked, when I brought the hoss up. Lord, he'd a killed me, if he durs' to; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a standin' as innercent and as humble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good and {{faithful}} woman," [...] he said, [...] "who {{it would seem}} are not fickle and light-hearted, or worse, like the multitude of your sex--perchance because your dark skin shields you from their temptations--you have set me in a cleft stick, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> held fast. Know that the rule of my order {{is that we should}} have naught to do with females, young or old; therefore how can I receive you or the child?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So they do; for neither you nor Fan gave us poor fellows {{the least}} hint about Syd, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> 've <b>been</b> having {{all sorts of}} scares about you." ...|$|R
60|$|Gr. <b>And</b> <b>there,</b> indeed, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a wickeder {{creature}} {{than the}} Devil, or even than my Lord Duke, for I believe, and yet don't tremble neither.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my heart! <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{loving you}} so dearly all the time, and you wouldn't see or speak or understand, but went away, left me to torment {{all three of}} us," [...] cried Christie with a tragic gesture.|$|E
60|$|But I insisted {{we should}} be parted, and parted in the end for ever, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the wiser of the two. I knew the insatiable urgency within myself. I knew that if I {{continued}} to meet Mary I should continue to desire her until I possessed her altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I have slain you, I have slain you, my love!" [...] she sobbed, {{making a}} low, sweet moan, as a cushat {{in the wild}} wood, for I lay deadly still, being {{overcome}} with pain and joy. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> my love comforting me as a mother comforts her child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Actually I {{have nothing}} to wear," [...] began Fan impressively; [...] "I 've been too busy to think or care till now, but here it is nearly May and I have hardly a decent rag to my back. Usually, you know, I just go to Mrs. O'Grady and tell her what I want; she makes my spring wardrobe, Papa pays the bill, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Now <b>I</b> 've looked into the matter, and I declare to you, Polly, <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> frightened {{to see how much}} it costs to dress me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where thou diest, will <b>I</b> die, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> will <b>I</b> <b>be</b> buried: the Lord do so to me, {{and more}} also, if ought but death part thee and me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alan sent me {{to school}} at Miss Lawler's when my mother died, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> ever since, while he has been these three years and a half on the African station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twenty,' says I, for my bid. 'Twenty-five,' {{says the}} little girl. 'Thirty,' says I. 'Forty,' says she. 'Fifty,' says I. 'Fifty-five,' says she. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stuck. 'Hold on,' says I; 'wait till I see my owners.' 'No, you don't,' says she. 'It's customary,' says I. 'Not {{anywhere}} in the world,' says she. 'Then it's courtesy in the Solomons,' says I.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then came}} the great thunderbolt--the tidings {{of the death of}} the King of England! I knew it would almost kill Eustace; I thought of my poor godmother, Queen Henrietta, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> among people who did not really care in the least! It was to them merely a great piece of news, that enabled them to say, 'Yield an inch to the Parliament and see what it will come to.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “My brother got {{me inside}} forty-eight hours, and {{through no fault}} of mine. Boarded me in the night with only the watch on deck. Hunters went back on me. He gave them a bigger lay. Heard him {{offering}} it. Did it right before me. Of course the crew gave me the go-by. That was to be expected. All hands went over the side, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> marooned on my own vessel. It was Death’s turn, and it’s all in the family anyway.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] said Jude aghast. [...] "I {{thought you}} understood? <b>I</b> mean that <b>were</b> <b>I</b> in a {{position}} to marry her, or someone, and settle down, instead of living in lodgings here <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> glad!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> thought, {{just the}} faintest tinkle of {{annoyance}} in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{experiment}} {{works out}} splendidly on paper, with decently wide margins for human nature. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> admit <b>is</b> the doubt and the danger--the human nature. But {{the only way}} to test it is to test it, which <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From France, lady. This ship put in at Marseilles, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{hired to}} nurse one who lay sick, which suited me very well, as I wished {{to go to}} Jerusalem to seek my husband, and good money was offered me. Still, had I known {{that they were all}} Saracens on this ship, I am not sure that I should have come--that is, except the captain, Sir Hugh, and the palmer Nicholas; though what they, or you either, are doing in such company I cannot guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{never lost}} his grip; {{but he got}} it butt {{downward}} for a moment too long. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it off between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> staring down at {{all that was left}} of Ted Baldwin. I'd recognized him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother wouldn't recognize him as I saw him then. I'm used to rough work; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.|$|E
60|$|A {{light had}} come by this time, {{and we were}} detected. There was a general sally upon the enemy in the garden before any one thought of me, except a 'You here!' when they nearly fell over me. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> left sitting on the stair, {{helpless}} without my crutches, till {{in a few minutes}} all returned declaring there was nothing--no signs of anything; and then as Clarence ran up to me with my crutches my father demanded the meaning of my being there at that time of night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{did so in}} my life. They {{called me}} so over there when they wanted to return me to hold my tongue in that House of Torment; but I guess it will puzzle the best Englishman {{going to find out}} whether I'm an American or an Irishman. They did {{something}} over there to make me an American; but they did nothing to unmake me as an Irishman. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> member for Cavan; and it will go hard with me if I don't break that Speaker's heart before I've done with him. What! I ain't to say that he goes wrong when he never goes right by any chance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only last year?' exclaimed Violet. 'O dear! <b>and</b> <b>there</b> have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> {{telling him}} all about--about this spring. I {{would not have}} done it, if I had known. I thought he looked melancholy sometimes. Oh! I wish I had not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It kept {{me awake}} last night, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to hum it this morning, in bed; <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> upon my honour. Gollop, my doctor, {{came in at}} eleven (for I'm a sad invalid, you know, and see Gollop every day), <b>and,</b> 'gad! <b>there</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> singing away like--a robin." ...|$|R
