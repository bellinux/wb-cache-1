40|$|The study investigates farmers' {{decision}} to afforest {{marginal agricultural land}} to create carbon sinks in western Canada. A real option model, which incorporates price risks related to carbon and timber revenues as well as opportunity cost uncertainty, is {{used to assess the}} impact of a carbon market on farmers' afforestation decision. Irreversibility of the decision is also modeled by including sunk cost of forest establishment and the cost of reversing the afforestation process. In addition, the non-permanence impact on the profitability of afforestation was analyzed by assessing the effect of two non-permanence carbon accounting schemes. Results indicate that both, actual non-permanence policies and the presence of real options, have a significant negative impact on afforestation incentives. However, the carbon market has a positive effect as it increases the expected revenues to afforestation and also represents a diversification opportunity. Yet, even in the presence of a carbon market the investment barrier remains considerable. Despite the positive effect of the carbon market, results show that unless carbon prices reach levels well above $ 100 /tC a subsidization of <b>afforestation</b> <b>cost</b> is needed in order to generate substantial GHG abatement from marginal agricultural land afforestation in western Canada...|$|E
40|$|Wetland {{ecosystems}} {{are one of}} the three great ecosystems on Earth. With a deepening of research on wetland ecosystems, researchers have paid more and more attention to wetland ecosystem services such as flood mitigation, climate control, pollution prevention, soil-erosion prevention, biodiversity maintenance, and bio-productivity protection. This study focuses on a lakeside wetland ecosystem in Hefei, a city in central China, and estimates the value of ecosystem services such as material production, air purification, water conservation, biodiversity, recreation, species conservation, education and scientific research. We adopted the market value method, carbon tax method, <b>afforestation</b> <b>cost</b> method, shadow engineering method and contingent value method (CVM) using questionnaire survey data during the study period. The results show that the total value of the ecosystem services of Lakeside Wetland Park was 144 million CNY in 2015. Among these services, the value of society service is the maximum at 91. 73 million CNY, followed by ecological service and material production service (42. 23 million CNY and 10. 43 billion CNY in 2015 respectively). When considering wetland ecosystems for economic development, other services must be considered in addition to material production to obtain a longer-term economic value. This research reveals that there is scope for more comprehensive and integrated model development, including multiple wetland ecosystem services and appropriate handling of wetland ecosystem management impacts...|$|E

According to the original survey data of eco-campus economic benefits with 3 different models, Principal Component Projection is used to discuss the calculation method for evaluation index weight of economic benefits in northwest rural eco-campus, and to establish the principal component projection model of eco-campus economic benefits after the normalization processing of index value by efficiency coefficient transformation method based on dimensionless treatment of matrix element. Result shows that from the aspect of financial cost, economic benefits of three eco-campus modes are insignificant. Both ecological benefits and economic benefits are achieved at the same time. According to the overall evaluation results of Principal Component Projection Model, the â€œPig, Toilet-Biogas-Vegetableâ€ mode has obtained the maximum economic benefits, followed by the â€œGrass–Sheep, Toilet-Biogas-Fruitâ€. And the â€œToilet-Biogas-Vegetableâ€ has the poorest economic benefits. This result is of strong practical significance and provides a theoretical basis for economic evaluation research and extension of eco-campus construction in rural primary and secondary schools {{in other areas of}} China.

40|$|Based {{initially}} on Canadian practice, {{research on}} the production and use of tubed seedlings in Britain has been in progress for 3 years (1968 - 70), and was begun because of their potential advantages as planting stock. Polythene greenhouses are used to produce pine and spruce seedlings grown in small plastic tubes filled with fertilized peat-sand compost, and planting is possible 8 weeks after sowing. On ploughed peat-land, step-planted seedlings are capable of high survival and vigorous early growth, with an effective planting season from mid April to late August. Animal browsing is the main adverse factor encountered, but has been less serious than expected. Very high planting rates are possible with a special tool. Seedling use could lead to large savings in peatland <b>afforestation</b> <b>costs,</b> and large-scale trials are planned. In contrast, seedling performance on ploughed mineral soil has been unsatisfactory due to severe frost lifting and poor height growth. Results in reafforestation trials have not been very promising...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an economic {{analysis of the}} planting of trees on marginal lands in Ukraine for timber production, erosion prevention, and climate mitigation. A methodology combining econometric analysis, simulation modelling, and linear programming to analyse {{the costs and benefits}} of such afforestation has been adopted. The research reveals that, at discount rates lower than 2 %, establishment of new forests is economically justified in the majority of forestry zones. Incorporating the effects of afforestation on mitigating climate change increases social benefits. However, the results indicate that whilst soil protection benefits to agriculture from afforestation in the Steppe are expected to be high, carbon sequestration and timber production activities in the Steppe are cost inefficient due to low rates of tree growth and relatively high opportunity costs of land. The opportunity costs of land are also high in the Polissja where <b>afforestation</b> is <b>cost</b> inefficient at 2 % and higher discount rate...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the timing of}} the use of biological carbon sequestration and its capacity to alleviate the carbon constraint on the energy sector. We constructed a stochastic optimal control model balancing the costs of fossil emission abatement, the opportunity costs of lands allocated to <b>afforestation,</b> and the <b>costs</b> of uncertain climate damages. We show that a minor part of the sequestration potential should start immediately as a "brake" slowing down both the rate of growth of concentrations and the rate of abatement in the energy sector, thus increasing the option value of the emission trajectories. But, most of the potential is put in reserve {{to be used as a}} "safety valve" after the resolution of uncertainty, if a higher and faster decarbonization is required: sequestration cuts off the peaks of costs of fossil abatement and postpones the pivoting of the energy system by up to two decades.

40|$|Abstract. Use of {{biofuels}} diminishes {{fossil fuel}} combustion thereby also reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. However, subsidies {{are needed to}} make agricultural biofuel production economically feasible. To explore the economic potential of biofuels in a greenhouse gas mitigation market, we incorporate data on production and biofuel processing for the designated energy crops switchgrass, hybrid poplar, and willow in an U. S. Agricultural Sector Model along with data on traditional crop-livestock production and processing, and afforestation of cropland. Net emission coefficients on all included agricultural practices are estimated through crop growth simulation models or taken from the literature. Potential emission mitigation policies or markets are simulated via hypothetical carbon prices. At each carbon price level, the Agricultural Sector Model computes the new market equilibrium, revealing agricultural commodity prices, regionally specific production, input use, and welfare levels, environmental impacts, and adoption of alternative management practices such as biofuel production. Results indicate no role for biofuels below carbon prices of $ 40 per ton of carbon equivalent. At these incentive levels, emission reductions via reduced soil tillage and <b>afforestation</b> are more <b>cost</b> efficient. For carbon prices above $ 70, biofuels dominate all other agricultural mitigation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Yamabugyousho Kimocho covers {{areas such}} as systems, {{techniques}} and punishments related to somayama,ship-building and silviculture. What follows {{is a list of}} a number of new insights extracted from the contents of the document. First, at the magiri and village level in addition to both the souyamaatai and yamaatai who were officials involved in forest administration there were technical forest specialists such as the yamashi, yamakounin and kobikinin. The yamashi was a technician in the field who assessed the measurements of trees intended for use prior to them being cut down. Yamakounin were technicians who carried out tree cutting, processing and nurturing duties. Y amakounin possessed knowledge about methods of caring for forests and they were positioned so as to {{play a critical role in}} the protection of (somayama) government-administered forests. Kobikinin are forest technicians who use saws to cut up trees. The most common method of shaving off and cutting up large trees prior to the influx of kobikinin was with an axe. The problem with the axe method was that too much wood was wasted. The Royal Government provided guidance on the use of saws to cut up wood and thereafter the number of kobikinin increased. Second, the administration of useful trees grown in places such as the somayama, satoyama (forests that could be freely used by local people for their lumber needs) and local village communities was carried out in accordance with the Royal Government's 'Goyoubokuchou'(Register of Government-Use Trees). The Goyoubokuchou was a set of documents that recorded a range of details about the kind of trees required by the government for public purposes. Details included tree types, locations of specific tree types and tree trunk measurements. Even today in forest administration a 'Shinrinbo' (Forest Register) is used that describes forest types, location and accumulation. According to the Goyoubokuchou there were 21 types of tree (recorded in the 'Yamabugyousho Kujichou' [Operational Affairs of the Forest Administration Bureau]) forbidden from being cut down and this was strictly administered. Third, in order to assure the lumber resources required for Chinese-style vessels used to cross to and from China the number of private boats and ships throughout the Ryukyu Kingdom were surveyed and certification marks branded on all of them for more effective administration. The administration of boat and ship-related timber was carried out by forest officials in terms of tree cutting and also by oversight officials stationed at each port to monitor boat and ship construction in accordance with 'tegata' (details on the vessel design). 'Kurifune' were a type of log or dugout canoe made by hollowing out large trees but were very wasteful in terms of some of the most important lumber to the kingdom. As such, after the issuance of the Yamabugyousho Kimocho instructions were given to replace the kurifune with 'hagifune,' a type of boat made by assembling sawn planks of wood. Fourth relates to the sentences imposed on people who cut down trees designated as for government-use without permission. There are numerous punitive regulations for people who do things like illegally reclaim land for cultivation purposes from government-administered forests. Depending on the type of violation there were a few rather harsh punishments, such as exile for life. Most of the punishments were fines, with half of the fine typically going to the whistle-blower(s) and the other half allocated to <b>afforestation</b> <b>costs.</b> Fifth, in order to improve the administration of somayama in a state of devastation a new reform of the systems and organizational structure was carried out. For example, up to that point the administration of somayama had been carried out by several magiri like the 'moyaiyama' (communal use forests), but after the issuance of the Yamabugyousho Kimocho a specific administrative area of forest was attached to one single magiri unit. The procurement of government-use timber was then carried out by each individual magiri unit. The magiri units of forest administration were later subdivided so that the administration was handled at the village level. It gradually became clear that any given area of forest was being administered by each village communally. Furthermore, the forest　management system was strengthened with new yamabugyou and hissha officials dispatched to the Kunigami and Nakagami regions in a shake up of the organizational structure. この「山奉行所規模帳」には、杣山、造船、育林などに関わる制度、技術、罰則などが記されているが、その内容から新たな知見 を抜き出して列記すれば、以下のとおりである。１つは、間切や村レベルで、総山当や山当の林務行政職員の他に、山師、山工人、木引人などの林業技術者が存在していたことである。山師は山で意図する寸法が取れる木を鑑定する技術者である。山工人は伐木、加工、保育作業などを行う技術者である。この山工人は山の手入れ方法に関する知識もち、杣山の保全に重要な役割を果たす技術者として位置づけられている。木引人は鋸を使って木を製材する技術者のことである。これまで斧を使って大木を削り取って製材する方法が行われていた。これでは木の浪費になるので、木引人を増やして、鋸で製材するように王府は指導している。 2 つは、御用木帳によって、杣山、里山、村落などに生育する有用樹木を管理していたことである。この御用木帳には、木の所在地、木の種類、幹回り、などが記載されていた。今日の林務行政で使われている「森林簿J(森林タイプ、蓄積量、場所などが記載) に類似する。御法度木として 21 種類の木(「山奉行所公事帳」 1751 に記載) が御用木帳に登録され、厳しく管理されていた。 3 つは、中国に渡る唐船の用材を確保するために、琉球王国内の民間の船の数を調べ、これらに焼印(認証印) を押して徹底的に管理していたことである。これらの船用材の管理は、伐採木に関しては山役人、船の建造に関しては、手形(船の設計情報) をもとに各港に常駐する担当役人が行っていた。大木をくり抜いて作るクリ舟は、木の浪費になるとして、この規模帳以後、製材した板材を張り合わせて作るハギ舟を作るよう指導している。 4 つは、御用木を許可なく伐採した者、杣山を焼き明けたりした者などに関する罰則規定が、数多く記されていることである。違反行為の内容によっては、一生の流刑に処すなど、かなり厳しい掟が設けられている。罰則のほとんどが罰金刑になっていて、罰金の半分は告発者に渡し、残りの半分は造林費用に当てるシステムになっている。 5 つは、荒廃した杣山の管理を徹底するために、制度や組織体制の改革を新たに行っていることである。たとえば、これまで杣山の管理は数間切が模合山(共同利用地) のように考えて利用してきたが、この規模帳以後、 1 箇所の間切単位に山の管理区域を定めて、御用木の調達も 1 間切単位で行われるようになっている。この間切単位の杣山の区域は、その後、さらに村ごとに細区分され、各村が共同で管理する山の所在が明確にされていく。さらにこれらの管理体制を強化するため、国頭地方や中頭地方に山奉行や筆者の役職を新設し、山の管理の組織体制の強化を図っているのである...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: climate change, carbon <b>costs,</b> <b>afforestation,</b> risk, {{secondary}} forests, conservation payments, {{ecosystem services}} This thesis {{is a collection}} of articles that deal with the economics of carbon sequestration in forests. It pays special attention to the comparison of forestry alternatives for carbon sequestration, carbon supply curves at regional and global levels and the impact of risk on payments for ecosystem services. Case-studies in Ecuador and Latin America contribute {{to a better understanding of}} these issues. Policy implications of this research are: (1) Natural regeneration of secondary forests is a cost-efficient activity for carbon sequestration in the humid tropics and should be included as part of the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. (2) Country-risk is a relevant factor to be considered in climate change mitigation assessments. When accounting for country risk ― associated with political, economic and financial risks ― the potential carbon sequestration at a global level is reduced by more than half. (3) Potential carbon sequestration through afforestation ranges from 5 % to 25 % of the emission reduction targets of different policy scenarios for stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and therefore is relevant in a global context. (4) Farm-level decisions are influenced by risks associated to price and yield volatility of land-use alternatives. Efficient conservation policies that aim at enhancing carbon sequestration, biodiversity and other environmental services should look at both net revenues and risks. Combining payments for conservation with risk-hedging strategies is a policy option to be considered by conservation agencies worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The city of Aksu, {{situated}} at the northern fringe of the Taklimakan Desert in northwest China, is exposed to severe periodic dust and sand storms. In 1986, local authorities decided to establish a peri-urban shelterbelt plantation, the so-called Kökyar Protection Forest, {{with the aim of}} reducing dust and sand storm impacts on Aksu City by the regulating ecosystem services provided by the plantation. It was realised as a patchwork of poplar shelterbelts and orchards. The total area of the plantation reached 3800 ha in 2005. The Kökyar Protection Forest is used as a case study to answer the following question: under which institutional frameworks and to which financial conditions can peri-urban shelterbelts be established and maintained? The endeavour of planting the shelterbelt was made possible by the annual mass mobilisation of Aksu citizens, based on the Chinese regulation of the "National Compulsory <b>Afforestation</b> Campaigns". Establishment <b>costs</b> amounted to ca. CNY 60 000 ha − 1 (ca. USD 10 000 ha − 1). Permanent maintenance of the plantation is facilitated by leasing orchard plots to private fruit farmers. From the perspective of the local economy, annual farming net benefits generated by Kökyar fruit farmers more than compensate for annual government grants for maintenance, resulting in an average overall monetary net benefit of at least CNY 10 500 ha − 1 (ca. USD 1600 ha − 1) in the long term. For a more complete understanding of Kökyar Protection Forest, future research should be directed towards quantifying the effect of its regulating ecosystem services and on investigating the negative downstream consequences of its water consumption...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{mitigation}} is rapidly becoming {{an item of}} social concern. Climate change mitigation involves reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through emissions reduction and or sequestration enhancement (collectively called offsets). Many have asked how agriculture and forestry can participate in mitigation efforts. Given that over 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the energy sector, the role of agriculture and forestry depends critically on {{the costs of the}} offsets they can achieve in comparison with offset costs elsewhere in the economy. A number of researchers have examined the relative offset costs but have generally looked only at producer level costs. However there are also costs incurred when implementing, selling and conveying offset credits to a buyer. Also when commodities are involved like bioenergy feedstocks, the costs of readying these for use in implementing an offset strategy need to be reflected. This generally involves the broadly defined category of transaction costs. This dissertation examines the possible effects of transactions costs and storage costs for bioenergy commodities and how they affect the agriculture and forestry portfolio of mitigation strategies across a range of carbon dioxide equivalent prices. The model is used to simulate the effects with and without transactions and storage costs. Using an agriculture and forestry sector model called FASOMGHG, the dissertation finds that consideration of transactions and storage costs reduces the agricultural contribution total mitigation and changes the desirable portfolio of alternatives. In terms of the portfolio, transactions costs inclusion diminishes the desirability of soil sequestration and forest management while increasing the bioenergy and <b>afforestation</b> role. Storage <b>costs</b> diminish the bioenergy role and favor forest and sequestration items. The results of this study illustrate that transactions and storage costs are important considerations in policy and market design when addressing the reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations in climate change related decision making...|$|R
