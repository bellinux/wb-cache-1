5|$|Following his baptism, Edwin's Northumbrian priests were in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to {{suppress}} pagan practices in Eorpwald's kingdom and convert the East Anglians.

5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|PedroII {{began his}} rule as a figurehead who held {{together}} a realm {{on the verge}} of disintegration. He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises. By the time of Afonso's death, the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity, development and tranquility. Even as the emperor's political successes and policies began to bear fruit, the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried on by his descendants. The emperor turned away from personal and family ties, and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered modernization and social advancement. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer mattered to him, and in 1889, he was deposed in a coup, marking the end of the Empire of Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Now a {{young adult}} financially on her own, she was free to pursue her love of music and {{teaching}} {{for the next five}} years. She spent a year studying at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia (1915–16). She also had two stints at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in 1917 and 1919. She returned home and helped her parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> director of music at a Methodist school for girls in Huzhou, (now Wuxing, Zhejiang), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious, however this time abroad gave way for a pivotal moment in Smith's awareness of the Southern double standard. She studied Chinese philosophy during her time overseas and by living there was exposed to the similarities between the suppression of the Chinese and African Americans in the States.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Muslim period, Persian became the {{official}} language of {{the northern part of}} Indian subcontinent, used by most of the educated and the government. The language had, from its earliest days in the 11th century AD, been imported to the subcontinent by various culturally Persianised Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties. Several Indians became major Persian poets later on, the most notable being Amir Khusro and, in more modern times, Muhammad Iqbal. Much of the older Sanskrit literature was also translated into Persian. For a time, it remained the court language of the Mughals, soon to be replaced by Urdu. Persian still held its status, despite the spread of Urdu, well into {{the early years of the}} British rule in India. Most British officials had to learn Persian on coming to India and concluded their conversations in Persian. In 1837, however, the British, in an effort to expand their influence, made a government ruling to discontinue the use of Persian and commence the use of English instead. Thus started the decline of Persian as most of the subcontinent's official governmental language, <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken up by the new language of the British Raj, English. Many modern Indian languages still show signs of relatively heavy Persian influence, most notably Urdu and Hindi.|$|E

2500|$|The Sunday Age on 15 November {{questioned}} {{the timing of}} the original press release about Sarbi's rediscovery, claiming that it had been deliberately held back to coincide with Prime Minister Rudd's visit to Afghanistan so as {{to be able to give}} the story to accompanying reporters. This was based on the fact that Sarbi had been in the hands of Australian forces by at least 28 October based on ADF photos posted on their website on the day of Brigadier Dawson's news conference, and not the week of 1–7 November as released. They further pointed out that questions over {{the timing of the}} release by a reporter at the Brigadier's press conference were not corrected by him. An ADF spokesperson denied any link to the visit, stating the delay in releasing the news was due to [...] "the need to confirm Sarbi's identity, physical condition and quarantine requirements for her return to Australia", details of which would be required by the media, that the reference to [...] "last week" [...] was correct at the time of the release's first draft and unfortunately not been subsequently updated before release, and that [...] "Brigadier Dawson was not aware of the exact date of Sarbi's return and was therefore not in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> specific about it."
