5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong.

The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Organizations {{often have}} to deal with large {{collections}} of business process models <b>and</b> compliance <b>rules.</b> Particular challenges in this context are compliance checks, consistency checks, and the mainte-nance of the process <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> repositories. In case that a-priory knowl-edge about dependencies within the process base <b>and</b> the <b>rule</b> base is not available, compliance checking must be performed by verifying all rules for each process, which turns out to be very costly in a context of large process <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> repositories. In this paper we present activity-oriented clustering techniques for efficient compliance checking which are particularly applicable in process <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> repositories where no a-priori clustering is considered. Further it is shown how the proposed clustering techniques influence the complexity of consistency checks. Finally, quali-tative and quantitative aspects of the presented clustering techniques are discussed. The techniques provide a first step to effective and efficient management of large business process <b>and</b> compliance <b>rule</b> repositories. ...|$|R
