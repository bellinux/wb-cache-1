At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> {{of the population}} after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival of Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|E

In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother.

5|$|In 634 CE Gaza was {{besieged by}} the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As {{following}} the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It {{was captured by}} Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by 'Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, although its Byzantine garrison was massacred. The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> of the population swiftly adopted Islam, Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i religious code, {{one of the four}} major Sunni Muslim schools of law (fiqh). Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.|$|E

40|$|As {{experience}} {{with use of}} on-line operating systems has grown, the need to share information among system users has become increasingly apparent. Many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing. Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing several users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage. Through the use of segmentation, however, Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information, independent of its physical storage location. Information is stored in segments {{each of which is}} potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege. Here, the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> <b>segmented</b> main memory. Since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics software achieves the effect of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>segmented</b> main memory through the use of the Honeywell 645 segmentation and paging hardware...|$|R
