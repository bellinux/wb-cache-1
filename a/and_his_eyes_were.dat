5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 12, 2009, her son, who was 56, was found bludgeoned and suffocated {{to death in the}} {{penthouse}} suite at the Hilton Hotel in Rye Brook, New York. He was bound with duct tape <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> gouged out. At the time of his death, he {{was having an affair with}} porn actress Rebecca Bliss. He was also the heir to a multi-million dollar estate.|$|E
500|$|Ellis {{admitted}} {{not being}} {{very familiar with}} the character, saying: [...] "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If they're not yours, I don't {{know whom}} they belong to," [...] he said. <b>And</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> bright, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> voice almost shook with emotion.|$|R
500|$|... tall, slim boy, {{straight}} as an arrow. His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, {{had it not been}} that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
2500|$|... 1984: Ricky Rudd was {{spun off}} the track at turn four {{at a very high}} speed, {{resulting}} in a blowover, then a series of violent flips. Ricky suffered a concussion, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> so swollen that he had to tape them open so he could race in that Thursday's UNO Twin 125 and subsequent races. [...] This practice is now illegal {{as a result of the}} [...] "Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Rule" [...] effective the 2014 season, mandating drivers take a concussion test, and Rudd would never have been approved to participate in subsequent races for a few weeks under current rules.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{schedule}} allowed the funeral train {{to stop for}} no longer than 30 minutes, {{only a few thousand}} people passed through the funeral car. A band played dirges in [...] "mumbled tones" [...] and a three-year-old girl laid a bouquet on the coffin as her tribute of respect. The coffin lay on blocks [...] in height. Festoons of black cloth hung from the sides, [...] "bespangled with silver stars and edged in silver bullion." [...] The upper lid of the coffin was laid back so as to reveal the head and bust of the late President. Lincoln's face seemed to retain all the dignity and strength of life. [...] "The lines of his grave countenance were unchanged, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> those of one in peaceful slumber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] I ejaculated. [...] "His skin <b>is</b> {{as smooth}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{as clear as}} mine are. He is the {{superior}} priest of the three, no doubt." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} smiled. He {{was little more}} than a boy, but his {{questioner}} noticed that he had a fine manly face <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> clear <b>and</b> steadfast.|$|R
50|$|Gisko is the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} Galapados Warriors, the genetically engineered soldier race created by the Gene Mage. His scales <b>are</b> khaki colored, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> yellow <b>and</b> pupiless.|$|R
2500|$|No {{physical}} description of Jesus {{is contained in}} any of the canonical Gospels. [...] In the Acts of the Apostles, Jesus is said to have manifested as a [...] "light from heaven" [...] that temporarily blinded the Apostle Paul, but no specific form is given. In the Book of Revelation there is a vision the author had of [...] "someone like a Son of Man" [...] in spirit form: [...] "dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. His head and hair were white like wool, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace (…) His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance." [...] (Revelation 1:12–16, NIV). Use in art of the Revelation description of Jesus has generally been restricted to illustrations of the book itself, and nothing in the scripture confirms the spiritual form's resemblance to the physical form Jesus took in his life on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Falasca {{noted the}} 2009 {{testimony}} of Sister Margherita Marin (b. 1941), {{who was one}} of the two nuns that found the pope dead in his bedroom on the morning of 29 September. John Paul I had made it a practice to have a morning coffee in the sacristy and then go into the chapel to pray before tending to the day's matters. Sister Vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15am (after about ten minutes) and went looking for him but found him dead, and hastily summoned Marin who also went into the room. Marin testified that Luciani's hands were cold, and she was struck by the darkness of his nails. Sister Vincenza said: [...] "He hasn't come out yet? Why not? and knocked a few more times but heard silence, then opening the door and walking in. Marin remained in the hallway but heard the elder sister say: [...] "Your Holiness, you shouldn't pull these jokes on me" [...] because Sister Vincenza also had heart problems. Marin further testified that original information provided by the Vatican regarding who discovered the pope was wrong, since it had originally been claimed the pope's secretaries Lorenzi and Magee did. Marin testified that [...] "he was in bed with a slight smile" [...] on his face. The reading light over the headboard was still on, with his two pillows under his back propping him up, with his legs outstretched and his arms on top of the bedsheets. Luciani was still in his pajamas with a few typewritten sheets in his hands. His hear was slightly turned to the right <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> partially closed; his glasses rested on his nose.|$|E
60|$|Her Daddy nodded, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> shiny {{bright with}} 'citement.|$|E
60|$|But Wellington did {{not hear}} him, or {{did not seem to}} hear him. He had reached the window <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> caught by {{something}} that he saw in the courtyard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir--it's funny," [...] Ransome {{was evidently}} puzzled. [...] "He hasn't spoken a word, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> shut. But {{it looks to}} me more like sound sleep than {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{many years}} Mark has been {{ferrying}} {{people across the}} river. His face is wrinkled, <b>his</b> hair <b>and</b> beard <b>are</b> snow white, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> dim; but still he rows on.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> angry under knitted brows.|$|E

6000|$|... "And is {{the heart}} of the white-headed chief soft, and will he think of the babes that his squaws have given him? He is hard to <b>his</b> warriors, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> made of stone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Augusta, {{that boy}} {{seems to be}} growing much stronger. He has a good color <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> getting to {{look more like a}} boy's eyes should. We'll make a man of you yet, Jims." ...|$|R
60|$|The old priest {{shook his}} head, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> very full of compassion.|$|E

60|$|Sheen improved. He took to boxing as he {{had taken}} to fives. He found that his fives helped him. He could get about on <b>his</b> feet quickly, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> trained to rapid work.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{pleasant}} relation for us!" [...] said Letitia, sarcastically. [...] "I think he's {{a good deal}} like Mr. Freely. He's got just {{the same sort of}} nose, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the same colour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{cares for}} his horse, {{with his own}} hands?" [...] This query {{seemed to be the}} climax of Mr. Gale's strange hunger for truth. He had raised his head a little higher, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> brighter.|$|R
60|$|Maraton glanced up. Selingman {{was leaning}} forward <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> fixed {{steadily}} upon his friend.|$|E
60|$|The {{man smiled}} grimly, {{though he did}} not move the pistol, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> unpleasantly steady.|$|E

60|$|The {{deep voice}} of Nightingale became {{suddenly}} hushed, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> riveted, by {{a sort of}} enchantment on the keen glance of the stranger in green, whose countenance was now seen blended among the more vulgar faces of the crowd.|$|R
6000|$|... "While {{the deaf}} man lodges at the cottage, he means mischief, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> on Miss Cristel. Early this morning, sir, I {{happened}} {{to be at the}} boat-house. Somebody (I leave you to guess who it is) has stolen the oars." ...|$|R
