5|$|Although {{originally}} anti-Zionist, Stern's views {{changed in}} the 1940s, and by 1942 he was strongly supported Jewish nationalism. When <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> branch of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism formed in 1944, Stern opposed its creation, even though many members, including its president, were leading members of Temple Sinai. By 1948, however, the congregation had also become supportive of Zionism.|$|E
5|$|After {{going without}} a rabbi {{for another two}} years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and {{separation of church and}} state, and opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} out of {{commission}} from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over the next five years, most of Yorktowns time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> firm and broken up that same year.|$|E

25|$|Meyer {{was very}} up front {{throughout}} his life about being too selfish {{to be a father}} or even a caring partner or husband. Yet he is also said to have been very generous with all his friends and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature {{to the fact that he}} was abandoned by his father, <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> police officer and overly coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and was something he secretly feared. During his entire life Russ Meyer spoke with only the highest reverence for his mother and sister.|$|E
25|$|At 1:08p.m. PDT, {{approximately}} {{seven hours}} after the rapes, Mixon's burgundy 1995 Buick sedan was pulled over by two motorcycle officers, Officer John Hege and Sergeant Mark Dunakin, for a traffic violation, in the 7400 block of MacArthur Boulevard in East Oakland, one block away from Eastmont Town Center and <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> Police Department substation. After collecting Mixon's driver's license, Sergeant Dunakin became suspicious that the license was fake and signaled to his partner, Officer Hege, to arrest Mixon. Mixon accessed a semiautomatic pistol, leaned out of the vehicle's side window, and opened fire without warning, methodically shooting both officers twice. After the officers collapsed to the ground, {{he got out of}} the vehicle, approached them, and fired execution-style directly into their backs. He then briefly remained standing over the bodies before fleeing on foot. Those who heard the gunshots reported Mixon as having fired six shots. Neither officer was able to return fire. Mixon was last seen fleeing westward into the surrounding neighborhood on 74th Avenue southbound.|$|E
25|$|Russ Meyer {{was born}} in San Leandro, California, the son of Lydia Lucinda (Hauck) and William Arthur Meyer, <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> police officer. His parents were both of German descent. Meyer's parents {{divorced}} soon after he was born, and Meyer was to have virtually no contact with his father during his life. When he was 14 years old, his mother pawned her wedding ring in order to buy him an 8mm film camera. He {{made a number of}} amateur films at the age of 15, and served during World War II as a U.S. Army combat cameraman for the 166th Signal Photo Company. Even then he already demonstrated a corny directing style and included nudity, like in scenes of naked GIs bathing in the Rhine in March 1945. In the Army, Meyer forged his strongest friendships, and he would later ask many of his fellow combat cameramen to work on his films. Much of Meyer's work during World War II can be seen in newsreels and in the film Patton (1971). On his return to civilian life, he was unable to secure cinematography work in Hollywood {{due to a lack of}} industry connections. He made industrial films, freelanced as a still photographer for mainstream films (he did the still photography for Giant), and became a well known glamour photographer whose work included some of the initial shoots for Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. Meyer would go on to shoot three Playboy centerfolds during the magazine's early years, one of his wife Eve Meyer in 1955. He also shot a pictorial of then-wife Edy Williams in March 1973.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to this legal victory {{and based on the}} [...] "illegal or immoral acts" [...] language of the opinion, the state passed a constitutional amendment creating the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).

[...] The Black Cat was shut down under this authority, along with a number of other establishments. In a test case involving <b>an</b> <b>Oakland</b> bar, Vallerga v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the California Supreme Court struck down this new law as unconstitutional.

[...] This pleased the rank and file, and restored confidence in police leadership. [...] Murphy also vowed to maintain the progressive policy towards gays that his predecessor had implemented. By 1980, one in seven new police recruits was either gay or lesbian. In one of his last public appearances, outgoing Police Chief Charles Gain stated that he fully expected to see the day when San Francisco would have both a gay mayor and Chief of Police. By October 1985, an organization for gay law enforcement personnel in California, the Golden State Peace Officers Association, had incorporated as a non-profit organization.
