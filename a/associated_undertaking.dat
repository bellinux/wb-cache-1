The evaluation was undertaken by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) over the period 2010 to 2012. The basic design of the TFA Pathway is as follows: 1. High-achieving university graduates are recruited nationally. Applicants are subject to a rigorous recruitment process and are {{selected on the basis of}} qualities and skills suitable to the teaching profession, and the possession of a genuine desire to reduce educational disadvantage. 2. Selected applicants (termed <b>Associates)</b> <b>undertake</b> six weeks of initial residential intensive education prior to commencing a two-year placement as an Associate in a disadvantaged secondary school (the Placement School). 3. <b>Associates</b> <b>undertake</b> a two-year employment-based course involving continued study toward a qualification in teaching; a teaching role with a 0. 8 FTE reduced load, and the support of an in-school teacher Mentor. 4. Further support is provided fortnightly by a Clinical Specialist (Melbourne Graduate School of Education, MGSE) and a Training and Leadership Adviser (TFA). 5. Associates are placed in secondary schools in geographic ‘clusters’, allowing for multiple Associates within a school and within a region to ensure Associates have access to peer-support. 6.

50|$|Meanwhile, Conference {{staff and}} leaders, espousing the {{predominantly}} liberal outlook of the denomination, made extraordinary efforts to encourage churches to pursue aims such as advocating {{for peace in}} Vietnam, improved racial relations, and formulating a more articulate and relevant faith {{for the needs of}} the younger generations. This was particularly remarkable because Conference ministers, and <b>associates,</b> <b>undertook</b> these aims in addition to the daunting task of servicing the needs of churches spread over a seven-state region, which entailed much time and expense in travel and meetings distant from the Atlanta headquarters. Some churches were quite enthusiastic about all of these programs, engaging in experimental ministries and worship; others, mostly those outside the major metropolitan areas, resisted what they saw as an intrusion upon their traditions and autonomy, and these gradually began keeping to themselves, often only supporting their associations or customary benevolences. By the 1990s, many congregations simply decided to withdraw and form their own groupings or, just as often, become totally independent, a trait increasingly noticeable also among recently established churches of fundamentalist or charismatic persuasion in the region. Those moves reduced the six associations down to four.|$|R

This research, which began in November 2012 and continued through March 2013, employed both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. For the quantitative component, a nationwide telephone survey was conducted from February 27 to March 10, 2013 among 1, 433 adults (including 240 cell-phone only adults). The sample included oversamples of African Americans (for a total of 226), Hispanics (total of 226), and renters (total of 436). To ensure an accurate representation of adults nationwide, slight weights were applied to bring the oversamples in line with their proper proportions in the overall population. The margin of error is +/- 2. 8 percentage points in the full survey sample and is higher among subgroups. The survey design was informed by 10 focus groups conducted in November and December 2012 to explore potential survey topics and to give Americans an opportunity to express their views in their own words. Seven in-person focus groups were conducted among various segments of the general population, including two groups in Nashville, Tennessee, two in Riverside, California, and three in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Four of these groups comprised renters and owners living in tenuous housing situations, while the remaining three were segmented by age to represent {{a cross section of}} younger, middle-aged, and older adults. Three telephone focus groups also were conducted among public policy experts and social service practitioners: one among public policy experts in fields adjacent to housing, such as education, workforce development, and poverty, one group among housing policy experts; and one group among education leaders and executives of community-based organizations providing social services such as health care, food assistance, and employment resources...|$|R
