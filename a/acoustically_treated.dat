The optimization of this treatment {{requires an understanding}} of the transmission and attenuation of the acoustic waves.

Based on an analysis of the measured results, the average of the overhead, overall, ontrack noise levels was approximately 4 db lower for the modified helicopter than for the standard helicopter. The improved in-flight noise characteristics, and associated small footprint areas and time durations, were judged to be mainly due to tail-rotor noise reductions.

5000|$|The {{environment}} of the factory ultimately dictated the album's overall aesthetic, with the band using different metals, woods and artifacts as percussive instruments. Prystowsky also notes that the album's emphasis on quieter songs is {{as a result of}} the recording space: [...] "It just sounded muddy when you tried to play rowdy songs. It’s not an <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> room, and if you get a lot of drums and electric guitar, then everything is muddy and you can’t hear the divisions, the timbres of the instruments. It had that kind of effect with some of those kinds of songs when we tried to play them in the factory building." [...] Prior to the album's release, Miller remarked that [...] "a lot of songs died in that space that would have flourished elsewhere, for musical reasons more so than lyrical reasons." ...|$|E
5000|$|The THX {{system is}} not a {{recording}} technology {{and it does not}} specify a sound recording format: all sound formats, whether digital (Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS) or analog (Dolby Stereo, Ultra Stereo), can be [...] "shown in THX". THX is mainly a quality assurance system. THX-certified theaters provide a high-quality, predictable playback environment to ensure that any film soundtrack mixed in THX will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer. THX also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard. Certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements; architectural requirements include a floating floor, baffled and <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> walls, non-parallel walls (to reduce standing waves), a perforated screen (to allow center channel continuity), and NC30 rating for background noise ("ensures noise from air conditioning units and projection equipment does not mask the subtle effects in a movie's soundtrack.") ...|$|E
50|$|Jet {{aircraft}} {{generate a}} lot of noise, contributing to noise pollution near airports. In modern high-bypass turbofan engines, the fan mounted afore the jet engine core is very large. The bigger the fan {{in comparison to the}} jet core, the more effective the bypass air is in enveloping the jet exhaust {{at the rear of the}} engine, reducing noise. The larger turbines needed to spin the large fan slow the jet exhaust, which also reduces noise. A hush kit produces a similar effect, using several modifications to the existing engine. Primarily, a device called a multilobe exhaust mixer on the rear of the engine mixes the exhaust gases of the jet core with the surrounding air and the small amount of bypass air available. Similar systems are also employed on many modern turbofan engines as standard equipment to further reduce noise. Most kits also make further modifications to the exhaust with <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> tailpipes, revised inlet nacelles and guide vanes, all of which reduce forward propagating high-pitched noise caused by the small, high-speed fan.|$|E
50|$|Once Orlando had {{relocated}} to Arizona, {{he got into}} small business entrepreneurship and software programming. He began teaching himself various computer programming languages and started a web application development company called Vision Media Group with his partner Jeff Sandrini, whom he met {{at a conference in}} California. During this time, he had taken a break from music to focus on branding himself as an expert in the field of Information Technology and Software Development. After a few years of this, he found himself drawn back to making music when building computers and programming software started to become less interesting to him. There was a lot of stress and intensity involved with his work running software and web development companies, so he knew that getting back into his musical passion would help to relieve some of that stress. His life as a software programmer began to take off around this time however, so he moved into a large two bedroom apartment and transformed one of the bedrooms into a professional <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> recording studio. He started buying an immense amount of gear for the studio and soon after decided to start a record label called Sonic Masterworks.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{acoustic}} {{data have}} shown larger noise attenuations than predicted for <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> aircraft engine inlets without splitter rings. These data have stimulated {{a more detailed}} theoretical study of the acoustic propagation of spinning modes in <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> open circular ducts. In addition, the suppressor with splitter rings was modeled by using the rectangular approximation to the annular duct. The theoretical models {{were used to determine}} optimum impedance and maximum attenuation for several spinning lobe numbers from 0 to 50. It is found that for circular ducts the maximum possible attenuation and the optimum wall impedance are strong functions of the lobe number. For annular ducts the attenuation and optimum wall impedance are insensitive to the spinning lobe number for well cut-on modes. The results help explain why suppressors with splitter rings have been quite effective in spite of the lack of detailed information on the noise-source modal structure. Conversely, effective use of outer-wall treatment alone will require expanded knowledge of the noise-source structure.
