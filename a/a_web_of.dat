5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|In 927, a {{peace treaty}} had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium, ending many years of warfare and {{establishing}} forty years of peace. Both states prospered during this interlude, but {{the balance of power}} gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines, who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> alliances surrounding Bulgaria. By 965/966, the warlike new Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to renew the annual tribute {{that was part of the}} peace agreement and declared war on Bulgaria. Preoccupied with his campaigns in the East, Nikephoros resolved to fight the war by proxy and invited the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav to invade Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Like other Jacobin novels, The Wrongs of Woman {{relies on}} <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> suggestive {{character}} names to convey its message: Jemima {{is named for}} Job's daughter; Henry Darnford's name resembles that of Henry Darnley, the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots; and George Venables shares a name with the notorious womanizer George, Prince of Wales. Wollstonecraft added {{to the reality of}} her philosophical text by quoting from familiar literature, such as Shakespeare, alluding to important historical events, and referencing relevant facts. The Wrongs of Woman comments on the state of women in society by rewriting earlier texts with a feminist slant, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones; Fielding's Mrs. Fitzpatrick becomes Wollstonecraft's Maria. These rhetorical strategies made the philosophical elements of the novel more palatable to the public.|$|E

5|$|Set on {{the fictional}} continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines {{and a large}} {{ensemble}} cast but centers on three primary story arcs.

The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting {{a return to the}} throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.|$|E

5|$|Changes {{in other}} areas soon began to be felt. The method of {{government}} after the conquest {{can be described as}} a feudal system, in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance, called homage, they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour. Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support, and eventually the peasantry held land in return for local labour services, creating <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts. This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo-Saxon system of government. The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest, as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church. The more prosperous peasants, however, lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land more dependent on providing labour services to the local lord. They sank down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor or seek alternative employment.|$|E

25|$|Amongst {{any society}} of individuals, the {{constant}} performance of dispositions, trivial and grand, forms an observable range of preferences and allegiances, points and vectors.
