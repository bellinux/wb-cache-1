5|$|By the ten-lap mark, Räikkönen {{had opened}} a three-second lead over Hamilton. Hamilton {{was the first}} of the leaders to pit, on lap11, {{followed}} by Räikkönen <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> later. Massa and Alonso pitted on lap13, with Heidfeld <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> after them. Heidfeld's BMW teammate Robert Kubica pitted on lap15, along with Bourdais. Räikkönen maintained his lead over Hamilton after the round of pit stops, followed by Massa, Alonso and Bourdais.|$|E
5|$|Truex Jr. {{stayed out}} of pit road, and led the field to the restart on lap 152 before Johnson passed him <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> later. On lap 154 Paul Menard took the lead, with {{drafting}} assistance from Earnhardt, before Johnson regained the lead <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> later. Kahne took the lead on lap 158, losing it to Earnhardt on lap 165. A five-car accident on turn two of lap 173, involving Yeley, Menard, Stewart, Stremme and Hamlin, prompted the fifth caution; none of the leaders made pit stops during this caution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bräck set the fastest {{time of the}} day with <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> of 31:676 seconds, ahead of Junqueira and Tracy. Tagliani was fourth-fastest; Memo Gidley was fifth and Shinji Nakano sixth. Carpentier, Bryan Herta, Takagi and da Matta followed in the top ten. The session was temporarily stopped when a track inspection was required after Fernández's right-rear tire blew, and Jourdain's engine failed after exiting turn four. Bräck was fastest in the third practice session with <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> of 31.219 seconds; Papis was second and da Matta third. Kanaan was fourth-fastest, ahead of Tracy and Junqueira. Christian Fittipaldi was seventh-fastest, Herta eighth, Tagliani ninth and Gidley completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. A track inspection stopped the session for eight minutes after several teams reported that their cars had sustained cut tires.|$|E

5|$|On lap 121 Kyle Busch {{took the}} lead, losing it to Jeff Gordon two laps later. Within <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> Gordon lost {{the draft and}} fell back to 27th, {{allowing}} Kenseth to regain the lead. On lap 127 Clint Bowyer passed Kenseth, holding the lead for two laps until a second yellow flag was displayed due to debris. Hamlin and Michael Waltrip staggered their pit stops, enabling each of them to lead <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> under the caution. Bowyer regained the lead after Waltrip stopped, and the race restarted on lap 134. Kenseth moved back into the lead on the next lap, with Bowyer falling back to tenth.|$|E

50|$|Lapping {{film in the}} {{telecommunications}} market is a precision coated abrasive consumable mainly used for processing and polishing optical fiber connectors. <b>A</b> <b>Lapping</b> film is typically a polyester base sheet, coated with precisely graded minerals such as diamond, aluminium oxide, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, cerium oxide. <b>A</b> <b>Lapping</b> film {{is designed to provide}} a uniform, consistent finish of optical fiber connectors end tips to ensure efficient light/signal transmission. They are available in 0.01-45 μm grades, with or without pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) backing.|$|R

5|$|With {{a lot of}} rain falling, {{the second}} {{practice}} session saw only eight drivers set timed laps, with just 14 taking to the track. Felipe Massa set the fastest time with <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> of 2:00.458. Both Lotus and Marussia did not run at all, while Fernando Alonso ran the most number of laps with twelve, following an engine change.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard and Button {{collided}} on lap18 when Button {{attempted to}} pass the Red Bull on the inside at turn eight; the Honda lost its front wing and retired <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> later after two pit stops. Hamilton continued his climb back through the field; he moved from 18th, passing Piquet, Davidson, Sutil and Bourdais in separate manoeuvres, to sit in 14th {{by the time he}} pitted on lap31. Piquet retired on lap42 with transmission failure, requiring a gearbox change before the next race.|$|E
5|$|Dennis's lack {{of concern}} was vindicated on Saturday, with Hamilton setting the fastest time in {{practice}} with <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> of 1:34.811. Massa finished the session {{a tenth of a}} second behind, with third placed Alonso a further half second behind. Kubica, Räikkönen, Rosberg and Heidfeld followed, with Super Aguri driver Anthony Davidson eighth fastest. Super Aguri are regarded as a sister team to the Honda F1 works team, who set only the 17th and 19th fastest times. The 2007 Super Aguri is widely thought to be an updated version of Honda's 2006 car.|$|E

5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who {{did not seem to be}} suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E
5|$|Iron Rattler {{is located}} in the Western-themed Crackaxle Canyon area of Fiesta Texas, sitting next to the Road Runner Express and The Gully Washer. It is Rocky Mountain Construction's second {{installation}} of I-Box track, and the first to feature a barrel roll inversion. Iron Rattler operates with two Rattler-themed trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. Each train is made up of six cars which seat riders in two rows of two.

While in the station, the trains will recline back to the laying down position.|$|E

Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station.

On lap 298, Hamlin made a pit stop and became <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> behind. He didn't return to the first ten positions afterward. Edwards maintained the lead to win the race.|$|E

5|$|Practice {{and first}} round {{qualifying}} {{was held on}} Thursday, October 15, 1998; Bobby Labonte led pre-qualifying practice with <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> time of 46.722 seconds. Five Ford teams, those of drivers Chad Little, Jimmy Spencer, Rich Bickle, Dick Trickle and Billy Standridge, ran Thunderbird-bodied race cars, instead of the standard Taurus ran at most 1998 Winston Cup Series races, believing the Thunderbird to have an aerodynamic advantage at the restrictor plate racetracks. Randal Ritter's car failed to pass inspection due to extreme irregularities in its construction, and the team withdrew before practice began.|$|E
5|$|Senna had {{qualified}} on pole position, having not set <b>a</b> <b>lap</b> time following Ratzenberger's death. He {{was joined}} {{on the front}} row by Schumacher and Berger qualified in 3rd. Damon Hill was able to improve on his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid; Paul Belmondo and Barrichello did not qualify.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the motion of diamond grains on the material removal rate and surface roughness in the lapping of Mn-Zn polycrystalline ferrite using <b>a</b> Sn <b>lapping</b> plate and 0. 3 μm diamond abrasives. The diamond grains can be classified into fixed and loose grains. The grains fixed to <b>a</b> <b>lapping</b> plate were confirmed by SEM and AFM observations. Among many experimental parameters, the change of the pitch of fine grooves on <b>a</b> <b>lapping</b> plate formed by the facing operation has a significant effect on the removal rate. This agrees well with the calculated number of loose grains under various pitches of groove. The average removal rate with fixed and loose grains was found to be about 2. 7 times higher than that with only fixed grains. These results indicate that during lapping, the material is mainly removed by loose grains. It is evident from AFM images that the lapped surface with material removed by fixed grains differs very much from that with material removed simultaneously by fixed and loose grains...|$|R
