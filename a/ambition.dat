Methods Using 34 years of longitudinal data from the British Cohort Study (BCS 70), we considered whether youth with (1) misaligned <b>ambitions</b> (i. e., those who either over- or underestimate the level of education required for their desired occupation), (2) both low occupational aspirations and educational expectations (low-aligned <b>ambitions),</b> and (3) uncertainty with regard to their future occupations (uncertain <b>ambitions)</b> at age 16 experienced more unemployment spells, lower educational attainment, and lower hourly wages in adulthood compared to youth with high occupational aspirations and educational expectations (high-aligned <b>ambitions).</b> Results Youth who hold misaligned or uncertain aspirations show long-term deficits in employment stability and educational attainment, which in turn leads to lower wage attainments at age 34.
