50|$|Historically, <b>antichresis</b> {{was used}} in Ancient Mesopotamia (Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia) and by the Greeks and the Romans. After the Western Church banned {{interest}} loans, it became a favored method of securing loans in early medieval society and was known in England as the gage of land (OFr gage, MLG sate, Germ Satzung). There were two variants: (1) the living gage (OFr vif gage, MLG dotsate, Germ Totsatzung), under which the income and profits coming from the estate went towards reducing the loan's principal; and (2) the dead gage (OFr mort gage, Germ Zinssatzung), under which the income and profits were taken only as interest. The latter form underlies the modern <b>antichresis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Antichresis,</b> under {{civil law}} and Roman law, is a {{contract}} whereby a debtor pledges (i.e., conveys possession but not title) real property to a creditor, allowing {{the use and}} occupation of the pledged property, in lieu of interest on the loan.|$|E
50|$|Pledge is the pignus of Roman law, {{from which}} most of the modern European-based law on the subject is derived, but is {{generally}} a feature of even the most basic legal systems. It differs from hypothecation and from the more usual mortgage in that the pledge is in the possession of the pledgee. It is similar, however, in that all three can apply to personal and real property. A pledge of personal property is known as a pawn and that of real property is called an <b>antichresis.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>antichresis</b> lease {{in civil}} law {{countries}} requires {{a lump sum}} tenant payment which is returned when the lease ends. The custody of the lump sum is the property owner's compensation. We present a theory of leases that emphasizes tenant liquidity risk and owner input moral hazard. Monthly rent leases dominate when tenant consumption depends importantly on owner supplied inputs. However, the <b>antichresis</b> insulates owners from tenant liquidity risk while rent contracts do not, making <b>antichresis</b> leases more attractive for tenant populations with greater liquidity risk. The empirical evidence from Bolivian property leases {{is consistent with the}} main model predictions. <b>Antichresis</b> Anticredico Chonsei Property leases...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} explores how distinctive institutional {{factors related}} to property rights determine urban development patterns and housing tenure modalities in a developing economy context. The first part proposes a choice-theoretic model that explains {{the existence of the}} <b>Antichresis</b> contractual arrangement as a way to temporarily divide property rights. The model explains why the <b>Antichresis</b> contract dominates the Periodic-Rent contract in terms of landlord profits for certain types of property in which the gains in expected profits from solving the problem of adverse selection of tenants offset the loss of expected profits created by the moral hazard in landlords investments. The empirical section of the dissertation provides evidence in support of the model. Using data from Bolivia, I find that property types that require less landlord maintenance investment have higher capitalization rates under <b>Antichresis</b> contracts than they would under Monthly-Rent contracts and vice-versa. Additionally, the model shows that the <b>Antichresis</b> contract has limited capacity for helping the poor as suggested by recent literature. On the contrary, it can be hurtful for the poor in markets were landlords have limited information about tenants, in markets with inefficient court systems, or in markets with tenant-friendly regulations. The second part of the dissertation explores the issue of squatter settlements in the developing world. The theoretical model presented in this part explains how the landlord squatter strategies based on credible threats drive capital investment incentives and ultimately shape urban land development in areas with pervasive squatting. The model predicts that squatter settlements develop with higher structural densities than formal sector development. This prediction explains why property owners of housing that originated in squatter settlements take longer periods of time to upgrade than comparable property owners who built in the formal sector even after they receive titles to their property. The higher original structural density increases the marginal benefit of waiting in the redeveloping decision creating a legacy effect of high-density low-quality housing in these types of settlements. Geo-coded data from Cochabamba, Bolivia, support the hypotheses proposed by the theoretical model and raise questions about the unintended consequences of current policies affecting informal development.
