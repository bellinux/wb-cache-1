Comparisons of N2 and Ar based spray forming showed that with all other factors remaining constant, the billet top temperature was lower with N2 than with Ar, because {{of the differences in}} thermal diffusivity of the two <b>atomising</b> gases: Ar has a thermal conductivity of 0.0179 W/mK which is approximately a third less than N2 with a thermal conductivity of 0.026 W/mK.|$|E

Depending on the alloy system and the final application, the remaining bulk material is usually processed to close porosity and subjected to a range of thermo-mechanical treatments. Spray formed materials are rarely used in the as-sprayed condition and are often treated by HIPing to remove porosity.

Spengler's major thesis was that a law of historical development of cultures existed involving a cycle of birth, maturity, ageing, and death when it reaches its final form of civilisation. Upon reaching the point of civilisation, a culture will lose its creative capacity and succumb to decadence until the emergence of [...] "barbarians" [...] creates a new epoch.

50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the <b>atomising</b> gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, atomiser gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed homogeneous structure.|$|E

Radial and axial variations of the spray velocity and temperature have been investigated, together with their dependence on <b>atomising</b> gas type, arc voltage, <b>atomising</b> gas pressure, and wire feed rate. Under all conditions, the average spray temperature was significantly above the steel liquidus temperature indicating most droplets were fully molten. Once projected away from the region of atomisation, the droplet spray typically cooled at ∼ 1 °C mm- 1 and ∼ 105 °C s- 1 and typical axial velocities were 100 m s- 1. Because of asymmetry in the arc itself and the resulting differences in the melting behaviour of the wires, the spray exhibited asymmetric radial variations of both velocity and temperature about the spray cone axis. The presence of oxygen in the <b>atomising</b> gas {{had a significant effect}} in increasing spray temperature via exothermic oxidation of the steel droplets. Processing maps have been constructed in which the variation of average spray velocity and temperature with arc voltage, gas pressure and wire feed rate have been fitted to a series of simple polynomial expressions.

40|$|Twin wire {{electric}} arc spraying {{is being developed}} as a technique to form thick steel deposits for rapid production tooling by robotically manipulating several arc guns over a ceramic pattern. Even though nitrogen <b>atomising</b> gas is used to spray the steel, entrainment of oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere of the large extraction booth results in deposits that are high in oxide and substantially lower in carbon than the original steel feedstock wire. The amount of oxidation and carbon loss can be reduced if spraying is carried out in a smaller, enclosed chamber. Under chamber spraying conditions, controlled additions of oxygen to the nitrogen <b>atomising</b> gas leads {{to an increase in}} deposition temperatures, better bonding with the substrate, a coarser microstructure, a decrease in deposit hardness and increased deposit brittleness through intersplat delamination and oxide cracking. Differences in substrate shape, gun manipulation and oxygen entry point into the spray between chamber and spraying in a booth using a robot also alters the balance of oxidation and carbon loss processes. Oxidation during the spraying of thick steel deposits can happen in three main ways: (1) primary droplets in-flight prior to deposition; (2) incorporation of secondary droplets generated by splashing; (3) at the deposit top surface. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{diameter}} of droplets in electric arc wire spraying {{is critical in}} determining the microstructure, porosity and oxide content of the resulting sprayed coatings. Droplet diameter controls dynamic and thermal behaviour in the spray, and the splashing and spreading behaviour of droplets at deposition. In electric arc wire spraying, the droplet diameter is determined {{by a combination of}} the melting behaviour of the feedstock wires in a direct current arc, combined with primary and secondary atomisation processes under the action of a high velocity <b>atomising</b> gas. The high frequency arc voltage variations during electric arc spraying of Fe- 0 · 8 C have been investigated and arc voltage fluctuations related to atomisation events occurring at the wire tips during spraying. A simple analytical model has been proposed which allows the {{diameter of}} primary droplets produced by atomisation to be calculated from the wire feedrate and the average time period for material removal, which was obtained from the voltage traces. Primary droplets were then assumed to undergo secondary atomisation according to correlations from the literature, and resulting droplet diameters were compared with diameters measured by experiment. Despite uncertainties in some of the thermophysical data and dynamic conditions during atomisation, predicted droplet diameters were in good agreement with experimental mass mean droplet diameters obtained under a range of <b>atomising</b> gas pressures, arc voltages and wire feedrates...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this paper}} is to conduct a life cycle {{assessment}} study of ceramic tiles (single-fired glazed stoneware) in order to identify the stages that produce the greatest impact on the environment and the materials and/or processes that make the largest contribution to that impact. The life cycle is considered to be made up of seven stages: (1) mining the clay, (2) <b>atomising</b> the clay, (3) production of frits and glazes, (4) production of ceramic tiles, (5) distribution, (6) installation and usage, and, on ending their useful life (7) treatment as construction and demolition waste. Materials and methods. A specific life cycle inventory was developed taking 1 m 2 of ceramic tile over a period of 20 years as the functional unit and using annual data gathered directly from 35 Spanish enterprises involved in the different stages of the life cycle of ceramic tiles. This inventory was then used to obtain environmental indicators (global warming, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation and human toxicity) for each enterprise and each stage of the life cycle under study. Results and discussion. Environmental data were submitted to a statistical analysis. This analysis made it possible to model the distribution of environmental behaviour of the life cycle of ceramic tiles considering the different influences from the different companies that were consulted for each stage in the life cycle. The statistical study allowed also obtaining confidence intervals for the mean and standard deviation of the environmental results obtained for each impact category. Conclusions. The stage of the life cycle with the greatest environmental impact for all the impact categories is the manufacture of the tile, followed by the process of <b>atomising</b> the clay and the distribution of the product. There is a direct correlation between these findings and the high level of energy consumption (mainly natural gas and fuel) in these stages. Moreover, the statistical analysis provided 95 % level of confidence intervals for the mean and the standard deviation very accurate which shows that using the mean inventory values from all the enterprises that were consulted within the same stage of the life cycle is a suitable method of working.

40|$|Abstract Metal {{injection}} moulding (MIM) attracts growing interest {{as an economic}} net-shape manufacturing technique for the processing of titanium and titanium alloys. Even for titanium-aluminides, intended for high-temperature applications, MIM {{is seen as a}} reasonable technique to overcome processing problems with conventional methods. In this paper, basic requirements in terms of raw materials, facilities and processing in order to produce high performance components are presented. Main focus is laid on the well-known Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. It is shown that the tensile properties of specimens after MIM processing can exceed the requirements given by ASTM standards even without performing an additional HIP process. For an oxygen content ranging from 0. 15 to 0. 33 wt % plastic elongation yields excellent 14 %. Fatigue measurements performed by means of 4 -point-bending tests show that grain size is more important than residual porosity in order to achieve a high endurance limit. This is shown by addition of boron powder which refines the microstructure dramatically. The modified alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 5 B yields an endurance limit of 640 MPa compared to 450 MPa of MIM parts made from standard alloy powder. Sintered components from Ti- 45 Al- 5 Nb- 0. 2 B- 0. 2 C (at%) powder made by inert gas <b>atomising</b> (EIGA technique) and processed by MIM exhibit a residual porosity of only 0. 2 % and tensile properties comparable to cast material...|$|E
