5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E

5|$|This image's iconic status {{has led to}} parody and satire. New York painter Frank Moore re-created Rockwell's all-white <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> an {{ethnically diverse}} family, as Freedom to Share (1994), in which the turkey platter brims over with health care supplies. Among the better known reproductions is Mickey and Minnie Mouse {{entertaining}} their cartoon family with a festive turkey.

However, the mini-high platform only served one of the line's two tracks, {{limiting the number of}} trains that could stop at the station.|$|E

5|$|After Nader got {{help for}} his drug {{addiction}} at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota, All My Children {{opted not to}} bring him back. Nader filed a $31.7 million lawsuit against ABC for breach of contract under the <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Act. ABC's lawyers cited Nader's violation of the morals clause in his contract as justification for not rehiring him. The firing and lawsuit {{caught the attention of}} non-soap opera medias such as TV Guide, Inside Edition, People, Celebrity Justice, Extra, Entertainment Tonight, and Larry King Live. Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff threw out the suit in 2004.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> origins {{from the}} Pacific are the {{smallest}} minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 Native Hawaiians, 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 {{people from other}} groups. Samoan Americans were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of Euless, a suburb of Fort Worth, contains a sizable population of Tongan Americans, at nearly 900 people, over {{one percent of the}} city's population. Killeen has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} Western countries, the U.S. is {{becoming}} less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since {{the mid to late}} 1980s, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E
5|$|Churchill {{has been}} a leader of Colorado AIM's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its {{associated}} parade. Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters of the parade. As early as 2004, Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional, arguing that the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution provides Native <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> a right not to be subjected to such displays, overriding the First Amendment rights of non-Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began {{applying}} for over $600,000 in TEA-21 grants {{to create a}} paved, <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The total cost of paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a person with a disability as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of Florida {{transferred}} to the United Kingdom in 1763. Spanish settlers had established missions—including one on Fort George Island named San Juan del Puerto that eventually gave the nearby St. Johns River its name—but their frequent battles with the Timucua {{and a decline in}} mission activity curbed development. When the British controlled Florida, they established several plantations in the region. Richard Hazard owned the first plantation on Fort George Island in 1765, harvesting indigo with several dozen enslaved Africans. Spain regained ownership of Florida in 1783 after the American Revolution and recruited new <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> promises of free land.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1936–37 season, the Rangers signed Johnson {{to serve}} as the {{defensive}} coach while he continued to play. He appeared in 35 games but scored no points. Seeing little playing time, and having an offer to coach a minor league team, Johnson requested that the Rangers give him his outright release following the season. Believing that he had become too slow to play, the team agreed. He subsequently signed with the New York <b>Americans,</b> <b>with</b> whom he played one final NHL season in 1937–38.|$|E
