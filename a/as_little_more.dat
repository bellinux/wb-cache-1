A sequel, entitled , was released ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was owned}} during his racing career by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor, winning {{his first two}} races as a two-year-old in June 2006. He did not win again until the spring of his four-year-old season, almost twenty-two months later. During this winless period he was {{sometimes}} regarded <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a pacemaker for more celebrated stable companions such as Dylan Thomas. In his final year of racing he recorded wins in the Prix Ganay, the Tattersalls Gold Cup, the Prince of Wales's Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and International Stakes. He was retired in October 2008 after running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Duke of Marmalade sired four European Classic winners in 2015, namely Nutan, Star of Seville, Simple Verse and Sound of Freedom.|$|E

25|$|Nikkatsu hired AV queen Hitomi Kobayashi (debut 1986 - see list below) {{to star in}} her own {{theatrical}} film {{series in}} 1987, but these films were judged <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than AVs on film, and were not popular.|$|E
25|$|Massachusetts has 351 {{cities and}} towns. Every {{part of the}} state is within an {{incorporated}} city or town, but many towns include large rural areas. The state's 14 counties have few government functions and serve <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than judicial districts.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{solar heating}} can heat most {{buildings}} {{in even the}} mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 15% <b>more</b> than new, conventional buildings.

25|$|Many pyramids {{are in a}} poor {{state of}} {{preservation}} or buried by desert sands. If visible at all, they may appear <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than mounds of rubble. As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Messianic Judaism {{has become something}} of an irritant to Jewish / Christian relations. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with the recognition of Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups, who dismiss Messianic Judaism <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than Christianity with Jewish undertones.|$|E
25|$|The 1979 film Angels Revenge, {{featured}} a similar concept with seven women joining {{to stop a}} drug operation.

25|$|There {{are other}} types of {{specialist}} police departments with varying jurisdictions. Most of these serve special-purpose districts and are known as special district police.

25|$|Pánfilo de Narváez gave Havana – {{the sixth}} town {{founded by the}} Spanish on Cuba – its name: San Cristóbal de la Habana. The name {{combines}} San Cristóbal, patron saint of Havana.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to compete with the}} AV industry, Nikkatsu hired AV queen Hitomi Kobayashi, who had debuted the {{previous}} year, to star in her own theatrical film series in 1987.

25|$|She {{talks of}} no future and no past as bayonets spear babies and beads are given away.

50|$|Many {{independent}} 1950s-era motels {{would remain}} in operation, often sold to new owners or renamed, but continued their steady decline as clients were lost to the chains.

25|$|The reconstituted realm {{was very}} weak {{compared}} with the pre-1204 Empire. The Palaiologoi emperors were not granted the earlier luxury of isolation. Imperial marriages became increasingly mercenary and royal princesses regarded <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than merchandise. The future Michael VIII married Theodora Palaiologina, a kinswoman of the Vatatzes Laskaris family, in order to solidify his position in the Nicean Empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1917, the Russian {{sculptor}} Chana Orloff introduced him to a beautiful 19-year-old art student named Jeanne Hébuterne who had posed for Tsuguharu Foujita. From a conservative bourgeois background, Hébuterne was renounced by her devout Roman Catholic family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a debauched derelict.

25|$|The Avro Type 688 Tudor was a British piston-engined {{airliner}} {{based on}} Avro's four-engine Lincoln bomber, itself {{a descendant of}} the famous Lancaster heavy bomber, and was Britain's first pressurised airliner. Customers saw the aircraft <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a pressurised DC-4 Skymaster, and few orders were forthcoming, important customers preferring to buy US aircraft. The tailwheel undercarriage layout was also dated and a disadvantage.|$|E
60|$|To be sure, Perry Hayden, poor fellow, did {{not bother}} Harrington much, for he died of {{pneumonia}} a month after he came there, but his widow carried on the farm {{with the assistance of}} a lank hired boy.

50|$|The Ghegs {{predominantly}} live in {{the mountainous}} north, north of the Shkumbin river.

50|$|Many {{commentators}} {{criticized the}} report for various reasons: alleged bias {{on the part}} of the commission, the terms of reference with which it was set up, and the use of evidence in the report. Several, including former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Warren Kinsella, and former cabinet minister Sheila Copps, criticized the commission <b>as</b> being <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than an extension of Liberal party infighting.|$|R
25|$|As {{the mining}} boom waned {{early in the}} 20th century, Nevada's centers of {{political}} and business activity shifted to the non-mining communities, especially Reno and Las Vegas, and today the former mining metropolises stand <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than ghost towns. Despite this, Nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world, after South Africa and Australia; the state yielded 6.9 percent of the world's supply in 2005 world gold production.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} two years for Surrey, with George Lohmann and John Sharpe doing all that was required, Lockwood was {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a capable batsman. However, with some support bowling wanted as Sharpe began a sudden decline, Surrey turned to Lockwood and on the treacherous wickets of August 1891 he proved quite irresistible. His 7 for 19 against Kent was seen as the most difficult bowling of the year by Wisden.|$|E
25|$|As {{most of the}} Assembly still favoured a {{constitutional}} monarchy rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a figurehead: {{he was forced to}} swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication.|$|E

2500|$|Today, some {{academics}} {{claim that}} Aristotle's system is generally seen <b>as</b> having <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than historical value (though {{there is some}} current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the predicate calculus.

25|$|Many reviewers {{compared}} the album with Isis' seminal previous record, Oceanic, often noting a 'progression'. Turner himself stated: “I do {{agree that it}} is a natural progression from Oceanic. It absolutely is an evolution and a step forward.” Sonically, compared with Oceanic, “the drums and vocals are submerged, the riffs intricately monolithic” and there is an increased prominence lent to electronics and synths; this led to it being characterised <b>as</b> “a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> polished”.|$|R
