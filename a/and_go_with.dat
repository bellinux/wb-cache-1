5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> <b>with</b> only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E

The newly married couples were chained together and taken to the port of embarkation. In May 1720, after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concessioners about this class of French immigrants, the French government prohibited such deportations. However, there was a third shipment of prisoners in 1721.|$|E

On April 24, 1615, they sailed from Honfleur {{aboard the}} St. Étienne. Le Caron reached Canada on May 25 and immediately accompanied some fur-traders to Sault St. Louis. His {{intention was to}} meet the Huron traders there <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> them to their own country. After a short time he travelled to Quebec to provide himself with a portable altar kit. On June 24, 1615 he assisted Father Denis Jamet in saying the first Mass in Quebec, on the Île de Montréal.|$|E

25|$|Michelle gets {{involved}} with another married man, computer salesman, Danny Whiting (Saul Jephcott), who tells Michelle that his marriage is over, whilst trying to reconcile with his wife. Michelle moves in with Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), a lecturer who persuades Michelle to resume her studies and enroll at university. Michelle and Rachel become inseparable, and rumours about their sexuality prompt Michelle to start dating Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), a fellow single parent. Some of the Albert Square residents, including Arthur, view their interracial relationship with concern. Later that year, Clyde is falsely accused of murdering publican Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). With the police closing in, Clyde decides {{to leave with}} his son, Kofi (Marcel Smith), and Michelle decides to take Vicki <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> him. Their getaway fails and Clyde is imprisoned for 3 months, but Clyde catches Michelle in bed with fellow student Jack Woodman (James Gilbey), and ends the relationship. Jack comes to Walford, claiming he and Michelle {{are meant to be}} together. When she rejects his advances, he behaves erratically: he convinces Pauline that he is dating Michelle and steals her unwashed knickers, makes threatening phone calls and he injures himself to gain her sympathy. Michelle turns to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for help, and Jack disappears while they're visiting his parents who tell them about his mental instability. In March, Vicki is abducted from her playgroup and Jack is the prime suspect but he is cleared when the police eventually find Vicki with a woman named Audrey Whittingham (Shirley Dixon) and Michelle is reunited with her daughter. In October 1993, the truth about Vicki's paternity is made public throughout the Square, and in April 1994, Vicki finds out that Sharon is her sister.|$|E
25|$|Daniel sells one of {{the houses}} from the estate, and Paul gives him a job as a salesman. Imogen voices her {{concerns}} about Daniel's changing behaviour, after he convinces Nate to buy a house knowing that certain amenities will not be built. Imogen tells Nate the truth and she and Daniel break up. Daniel also falls out with Paul when he admits to leaking Paul's files to the media. Daniel sees Paul receiving a loan from Dimato for Paul's new business venture. Paul tells Daniel to leave town, which he does without revealing what he knows. He returns with a new hair cut and wants to work at Lassiter's again. Julie Quill agrees to employ him. Daniel and Imogen eventually get back together, but when he works extra hours, she becomes dissatisfied and develops feelings for Tyler. She admits this to Daniel, who decides they {{take a break and be}} free to date other people, despite Imogen insisting she would never have acted on her attraction to Tyler. Josh tries to convince Daniel to reconsider the break-up, but Daniel responds by criticising him for his failures as a father, before the hotel boiler explodes, trapping them both under a column. Despite knowing the column is the only thing keeping him from haemorrhaging to death, Josh asks Karl to lift it to save Daniel. Imogen later tells Daniel that Josh died to save him, and they reunite. Daniel is discharged after undergoing surgery. Imogen receives a job offer in Los Angeles and she accepts. Daniel offers to quit his job <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> her. When Imogen mentions spouses can apply for a visa, Daniel proposes and she accepts. Daniel's younger sister Madison (Sarah Ellen) arrives to check up on him on behalf of their parents. A judge grants Daniel and Imogen an expedited marriage license and they decide to marry in secret. However, Imogen's parents interrupt the ceremony and convince Daniel and Imogen to get married at their home in front of their family and friends. After the wedding, Daniel and Imogen leave Erinsborough for Brisbane to see Daniel's parents, before going to Los Angeles.|$|E

Logan then ran up the {{staircase}} and went into his former bedroom, now used as a guest bedroom, and closed the door. Arnaud and Magruder {{followed him to the}} room and stood outside the door. Arnaud tried to convince Logan {{to come out of the}} room, as Logan's parents and Magruder, who had joined the department in February 2001, stood by, watching. After Logan's parents left the scene and went to the house's master bedroom, Logan became belligerent and uncooperative. Partially hidden behind a closet door, Logan retrieved a semi-automatic 9mm-chambered handgun and fired at Arnaud, where a bullet struck him in the throat and severed his carotid artery. Logan then shot Arnaud fatally in the chest.|$|E
500|$|According to Burks, Hubbard [...] "was so {{sure he had}} {{something}} 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' {{and that they were}} to meet him at Penn Station, and he would discuss it with them <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> whomever gave him the best offer." [...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position." [...] He went on: ...|$|E

Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control. Berg recalled, [...] "Some guys got hurt, some guys got bumped up and ribs were broken, a lung was punctured, some concussions, but these guys were determined to try and do everything they could to capture what Marcus described in the book."

500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> what has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

2500|$|... "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" [...] is a blues {{standard}} {{written by}} Jimmy Cox in 1923.

As a vaudeville-style blues, it was popularized by Bessie Smith, the preeminent female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s.

[...] Cotton was persuaded to remain in Boston, though he continued to be questioned for his doctrines. [...] His dilemma was like that of Wheelwright, but {{the difference between the two}} men was not in their doctrines but in their personalities. [...] Wheelwright was contentious and outspoken, while Cotton was mild and tractable. [...] It was Wheelwright's nature to separate from those who disdained him; it was Cotton's nature to make peace without compromising his essential principles, according to the views of some modern historians.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{acclaimed}} {{the film}} in general, stating that [...] "Seven Years in Tibet is an ambitious and beautiful movie with much to interest the patient viewer, but it makes the common mistake of many films about travelers and explorers: It {{is more concerned with}} their adventures than with what they discover. Additionally, Ebert believed the film was told {{from the perspective of the}} wrong character and thought the casting of Pitt and Thewlis should have been reversed. Derek Elley of Variety praised the film's overall production value but thought: [...] "for a story with all the potential of a sweeping emotional drama set in great locations, too often you just long for the pic to cut loose from the ethnography and correct attitudes <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the drama in old Hollywood style." ...|$|E
