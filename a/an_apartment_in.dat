5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door.

This achievement prompted her parents to rent <b>an</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis.
