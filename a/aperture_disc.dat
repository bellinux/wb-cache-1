5000|$|The Trionic T5.2 uses a Mecel {{patented}} ion-current measurement1 {{to decide}} which cylinder was in the compression phase and had just ignited the air/fuel mixture. The ion-current measurement is thus used to synchronise the ignition's firing of the spark plug with the cylinder which is full of compressed air/fuel. This ion-current measurement can also determine whether there had been detonation or knocking when the cylinder fired. Finally, the ion-current measurement {{can be used to}} identify a misfire with outstanding accuracy. [...] Trionic T5.2 uses a MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor to, indirectly, measure the weight of the air that has been drawn/forced into the cylinders. It uses a simple slotted <b>aperture</b> <b>disc</b> in conjunction with a crank position sensor to identify the Top Dead Center (TDC) for cylinders 1 & 4 and also to measure the engine's RPM.|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{velocity}} taper {{is provided}} for a traveling wave tube with increased linearity to avoid intermodulation of signals being amplified. In a traveling wave tube, the slow wave structure is a helix including a sever. A dynamic velocity taper {{is provided by}} gradually reducing the spacing between the repeating elements of the slow wave structure which are the windings of the helix. The reduction which takes place coincides with the ouput point of helix. The spacing between the repeating elements of the slow wave structure is ideally at an exponential rate because the curve increases the point of maximum efficiency and power, at an exponential rate. A coupled cavity traveling wave tube having cavities is shown. The space between <b>apertured</b> <b>discs</b> is gradually reduced from 0. 1 % to 5 % at an exponential rate. Output power (or efficiency) versus input power for a commercial tube is shown...|$|R
50|$|Third-generation {{optical discs}} are in development, meant for distributing high-definition video and support greater data storage capacities, {{accomplished}} with short-wavelength visible-light lasers and greater numerical <b>apertures.</b> Blu-ray <b>Disc</b> and HD DVD uses blue-violet lasers and focusing optics of greater aperture, {{for use with}} discs with smaller pits and lands, thereby greater data storage capacity per layer.In practice, the effective multimedia presentation capacity is improved with enhanced video data compression codecs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Ross {{developed}} a small transparent phénakisticope system, called Wheel of life, which fitted inside a standard magic lantern slide. A first version, patented in 1869, had a glass disc with eight phases {{of a movement}} and a counter-rotating glass shutter <b>disc</b> with eight <b>apertures.</b> The <b>discs</b> depicted Ice Skaters, Fishes, Giant's Ladder, Bottle Imp and other subjects. An improved version had 13 images and a single slot shutter disc and received British Patent 2685 on 10 October 1871.|$|R
40|$|We used {{a virtual}} reality setup to let {{participants}} grasp discs, which differed in luminance, chromaticity and size. Current theories on perception and action propose {{a division of}} labor in the brain into a color proficient perception pathway and a less color-capable action pathway. In this study, we addressed the question whether isoluminant stimuli, which provide only a chromatic but no luminance contrast for action planning, are harder to grasp than stimuli providing luminance contrast or both kinds of contrast. Although we found that grasps of isoluminant stimuli had a slightly steeper slope relating the maximum grip <b>aperture</b> to <b>disc</b> size, all other measures of grip quality were unaffected. Overall, our results {{do not support the}} view that isoluminance of stimulus and background impedes the planning of a grasping movement...|$|R
30|$|At high {{temperature}} with aging conditions at 400  °F (Fig.  7), the NS blend and G and NS blend failed to develop strong seal after applying 400  °F aging condition for 24  h, but the G, SCC, and CF formulation {{still had the}} ability to seal after 24  h, then failed in a 72 -h test. The 400  °F aging condition does not affect the sealing ability of the G and SCC # 4 formulation for at least 72  h of the aging test. The thermal stability of the LCM particles controls how LCM performs in the aging tests. Observation provided that the NS particles removed from the <b>disc</b> <b>aperture</b> were so weak that they could be broken easily using fingertips.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe minimum etched pits of 300 nm {{diameter}} and the trenches of 300 nm width with a 50 nm depth for both geometries are prepared in the GeSbSn oxide photoresist on the silicon substrates. The lithographic patterns are recorded by direct laser writing, using a 405 nm laser diode and 0. 9 numerical <b>aperture</b> media <b>disc</b> mastering system. The developed pit diameters in an inorganic oxide photoresist {{are smaller than}} the exposed laser beam spot diameter due to thermal lithography. The crystal structures of the as-sputtered and the annealed powder samples scraped from the sputtered films are examined by X-ray diffractometer. The effect of the heating rate on the crystallization temperatures is evaluated by a differential scanning calorimeter and the crystallization activation energy is determined from Kissinger's plot. The optical and absorption characteristics of the oxides are strongly dependent on the oxygen flow rate during the reactive magnetron sputtering process. The transmittance of the deposited films increases and the absorption decreases with increasing oxygen flow rate, which implies that at high oxygen flow rate, the film resembles dielectric material. The oxygen flow rate during the deposition process is defined within a limited range to obtain the proper extinction coefficient. The working extinction coefficients of the films ranging from 0. 5 to 0. 8 are applied in this study to achieve the sharp and vertical edge of the etched pits and trenches of 50 nm depth...|$|R
40|$|A {{subcutaneous}} electrode structure {{suitable for}} a chronic implant and for taking a low noise electrocardiogram of an active animal, comprises a thin inflexible, smooth disc of stainless steel having a diameter as of 5 to 30 mm, which is sutured in place to the animal being monitored. The disc electrode includes a radially directed slot extending in from {{the periphery of the}} disc for approximately 1 / 3 of the diameter. Electrical connection is made to the disc by means of a flexible lead wire that extends longitudinally of the slot and is woven through <b>apertures</b> in the <b>disc</b> and held at the terminal end by means of a spot welded tab. Within the slot, an electrically insulative sleeve, such as silicone rubber, is placed over the wire. The wire with the sleeve mounted thereon is captured in the plane of the disc and within the slot by means of crimping tabs extending laterally of the slot and over the insulative wire. The marginal lip of the slot area is apertured and an electrically insulative potting material such as silicone rubber, is potted in place overlaying the wire slot region and through the apertures...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the neutron star X-Ray Transient Cen X- 4. Our aim is to look for any {{evidence}} of irradiation of the companion with a detailed analysis of its radial velocity curve, relative contribution of the donor star and Doppler tomography of the main emission lines. To improve our study all our data are compared with a set of simulations that consider different physical parameters of the system, like the <b>disc</b> <b>aperture</b> angle and the mass ratio. We conclude that neither the radial velocity curve nor the orbital variation of the relative donor's contribution to the total flux are affected by irradiation. On the other hand, we do see emission from the donor star at Hα and HeI 5876 which we tentatively attribute to irradiation effects. In particular, the Hα emission from the companion is clearly asymmetric and we suggest is produced by irradiation from the hot-spot. Finally, from the velocity of the HeI 5876 spot we constrain the disc opening angle to alpha= 7 - 14 deg. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A as a R...|$|R
40|$|We obtain {{analytically}} {{the exact}} non-retarded dispersive interaction energy between an atom and a perfectly conducting disc. We consider the atom in the symmetry {{axis of the}} disc and assume the atom is predominantly polarizable {{in the direction of}} this axis. For this situation we discuss the finite size effects on the corresponding interaction energy. We follow the recent procedure introduced by Eberlein and Zietal together with the old and powerful Sommerfeld's image method for non-trivial geometries. For the sake of clarity we present a detailed discussion of Sommerfeld's image method. Comparing our results form the atom-disc system with those recently obtained for an atom near a conducting plane with a circular aperture, we discus the non-additivity of the van der Waals interactions involving an atom and two complementary surfaces. We show that there is a given ratio z/a between the distance z from the atom {{to the center of the}} <b>disc</b> (<b>aperture)</b> and the radius of the <b>disc</b> a (<b>aperture)</b> for which non-additivity effects vanish. Qualitative arguments suggest that this quite unexpected result will occur not only for a circular hole, but for anyother symmetric hole. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
