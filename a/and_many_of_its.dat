5|$|No.410 Squadron {{supported}} the Allied forces during the Normandy Landings and the Battle of the Bulge, flew nightly patrols {{during this time}} <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> pilots gained ace status. Two members of No.410 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant (F/L) Currie and Flying Officer (F/O) Rose, were the first members of the RCAF to see the German V-2 rocket in flight.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{chemical}} {{exposure to}} benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial {{as a cause}} of AML. Benzene <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro. While some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML, others have suggested the attributable risk, if any, is slight.|$|E

5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up {{in the north and}} down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Francis Lynch (born March 31, 1955) is an American {{politician}} {{who has served}} {{as a member of the}} U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts since 2001.

Lynch was previously an ironworker and lawyer, and served in both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|A Phoenix {{municipal}} bond election in March 2006 provided $2 {{million to the}} project, marking {{the first time the}} zoo has received public funds in its history. On 8 June 2006, then-zoo director Jeff Williamson announced a major fund-raising drive over the next 10 years to update the zoo's infrastructure <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> aging exhibits. The zoo needs to raise $70 million to complete the project. In 2009, a shorter term goal is to raise $20 million by 2012 to pay for a number of improvements that are already under way.|$|E
5|$|A.phalloides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{poisonous}} of all known toadstools. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick had two {{well-known}} theatres in the 20th century. The Chiswick Empire (1912 to 1959) was at 414 Chiswick High Road.

5|$|During the war, the {{contents}} of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. After a reorganization in 1869, the society commenced construction of the present Literary Hall in downtown Romney. It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in 1870 and in that year completed Literary Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its literary activities.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{uprising}} was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness {{of some of}} the PMO activists. Piłsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising in the Suwałki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched {{the uprising}}, which while locally successful, led to the failure of the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> former supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.|$|E
5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> eastern lands {{were taken by}} Henry III of England in 1247. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales. Llywelyn extended the castle with an additional tower to the south, similar to that built at Dolforwyn, probably {{in order to provide}} additional accommodation.|$|E

Hywel Foel ap Griffri wrote a famous poem describing Owain's long imprisonment in a round tower; historians believe that this refers to the keep at Dolbardarn.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD {{provides}} several security-related features including {{access control}} lists (ACLs), security event auditing, extended file system attributes, mandatory access controls (MAC) and fine-grained capabilities.

5|$|Horvath {{expected}} {{his college}} football career {{to be over}} in 1942. He finished his undergraduate degree that year and enrolled in a graduate program at The Ohio State University College of Dentistry. Ohio State's football program, meanwhile, struggled in 1943 after Brown <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> best players entered the military during World War II. Carroll Widdoes, an assistant under Brown, was appointed the acting head coach and led the team to a 3–6 record.|$|E

5|$|In 1907 and 1908, {{the farm}} <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> workers moved to Pine Plains. Although {{preliminary}} {{steps in the}} relocation were primarily small, the final October 1908 transfer used two trains to move 300 cattle. The rest of the cattle were transferred a day later, to the farm's main station (between Pine Plains and Attlebury on the Central New England Railway) at Barn A. During Briarcliff Manor's first automobile race in 1908, the barns were used for mechanic crews and each driver had his own crew weeks before the race. In 1909 Law formed the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Manor property. He sold the Pine Plains property in 1918 and died in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 215 (I-215), {{also known}} locally as the belt route or two-fifteen, is an {{auxiliary}} interstate in the U.S. state of Utah that forms a 270-degree loop around Salt Lake City <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> suburbs. The route begins {{at the mouth of}} Parley's Canyon at a junction with I-80 east of the city center, and heads south through the edge of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area's eastern suburbs of Millcreek, Holladay, and Cottonwood Heights.

It then enters North Salt Lake and Davis County for a short distance before reaching I-15 northwest of the city center.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b {{is one of}} {{the first}} five planets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is a Hot Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger.
