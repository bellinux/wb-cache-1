500|$|The film {{included}} known actors {{from the}} show such as David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner and William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man, {{as well as new}} actors and characters to the franchise. These included Martin Landau and Blythe Danner. The signing of these actors broke with what had become tradition for The X-Files. Carter had purposely cast virtually unknown actors for the television series, to make it more believable; [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> in an actor whose face is very recognizable, you've got a situation that works against the reality of the show." [...] He saw creating the film as a chance to break this rule. He offered Glenne Headly the small role of a bartender. A fan of the show, she accepted enthusiastically.|$|E
500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The magazine's History of 0-60 article said a 1974 {{pre-production}} Cosworth Vega's time of 7.7seconds was {{the fastest}} that year. Testing a 1975 model, the magazine said: [...] "The outstanding {{feature of the}} Cosworth Vega is its excellent balance. Roll-stiffness distribution is ideal, with little understeer entering a turn, and {{just the right amount}} of drift from the tail <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your foot down to exit [...] [...] [...] Through the woods or down a mountain, the Cosworth is a feisty aggressor willing, if not altogether able to take on the world's best GT cars." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Village in 2004, Shyamalan had been {{planning}} a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out {{so that he could}} make Lady in the Water. [...] "I love that book. I mean, it's basically [...] a kid born in the same city as me — it almost felt predestined", Shyamalan said. [...] "But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> my name on it, everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie".|$|E
60|$|ALICE. He {{followed}} me about, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it, before I knew you. I don't know why I quarrelled with him.|$|E
60|$|FANNY. You've a {{wonderful}} way with you, George. It always sounds right <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it--even when one jolly well knows that it isn't.|$|E
6000|$|... "Covent Garden will do {{very well}} indeed," [...] the sub-editor told him. [...] "You needn't bother about the description. Just do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say; <b>put</b> down--what <b>you</b> see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not go}} to Washington," [...] he said. [...] "You will {{understand}} that diplomatically, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>put</b> it, I do not exist. Neither is it necessary. I am here to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} have not," [...] said Mr. Lavender. [...] "I have never, or very seldom, noticed that narrowness in public men, nor have I ever seen them 'looking fools' <b>as</b> <b>you</b> rudely <b>put</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means," [...] he told her, with {{a forced}} smile, [...] "that your husband is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{it in your}} {{expressive}} language, a fraud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] said Lestrade. [...] "Wonderful! It's all {{as clear}} as crystal, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it. But what {{is the object of}} this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Quoth JANE, [...] "Well, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the case, I'm true enough, no doubt, But then, you see, in {{this here}} place There's none {{to cut you}} out.|$|E
6000|$|The worthy seaman, who {{was indeed}} an {{exceptionally}} good-looking tar, modestly replied--"Well now, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>put</b> it so plump I don't mind if I do confess that I've had some wild suspicions o' that sort now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither of {{them would}} carry him a mile. He wants about as good an animal <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> him upon. I don't know what I'm to do. It's all very well for Laura {{to say that he}} must be mounted." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chief Counsel Herbert Beaser: Let me get {{the limits}} as far <b>as</b> what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> into your {{magazine}}. Is the sole test of what <b>you</b> would <b>put</b> into your magazine whether it sells? Is there any limit {{you can think}} of that <b>you</b> would not <b>put</b> in a magazine because you thought a child should not see or read about it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Panney," [...] said Ralph, quickly, [...] "if you {{are going}} to stir her up with {{questions}} such <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> to me, I beg you will not see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{whom the}} man with the nose had {{addressed}} now spoke. [...] "I have certainly never thought before of a red nose as a sorrowful thing, but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} it worth while, Mr. Trent? There is so much, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it, to be explained, that the task, even to a man of your versatility, seems hopeless!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Nieto, born in Seattle, Washington {{and raised}} in Sacramento California, is a devout Christian. Nieto sees his jumping ability as a gift from God, saying, [...] "Your only {{limitations}} are what you believe them to be and <b>as</b> long <b>you</b> <b>put</b> God first <b>you</b> can achieve all things through Him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was expecting}} to see you, baron. I {{received}} your note saying that you had taken the command of your regiment, and would do yourself the honour of presenting yourself <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> had <b>put</b> matters in trim. Are you satisfied with your men and your officers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{suggested}} {{that you should}} coerce her, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it. I merely meant that you could point out to her, as a father, where her duty and happiness lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not sure," [...] she was saying, [...] "that I {{believe that}} a man can be so happy {{that he wants to}} kiss the nearest thing in sight, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's true,' said Mr. Underwood. 'A terrible {{disappointment}} that young dog {{has been to}} me, Felix Underwood; but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it, there's an honesty in the thing! Where is my fine gentleman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Deering laughed. [...] "Search me! All I've got above {{five hundred}} dollars you can have for keeps. Looks <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> the fellow off." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Neighbor Vito Viti," [...] {{put in the}} vice-governatore, [...] "it may be well to {{remember}} that this matter is not to be recorded <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>put</b> on file the confessions of a thief; it may be better to let the honest boatman tell his story in his own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Hoist {{with his}} own petard?'" [...] {{returned}} the plotter musingly. [...] "One more quotation: strange! But indeed my brain is struck with numbness.

6000|$|... 'As much, sir, <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a soul into a hog, {{and told}} him that he was a gentleman's son; and, if every time he remembered that, he got spirit enough to conquer his hoggishness, and behave like a man, till the hoggishness died out of him, and the manliness grew up and bore fruit in him, more and more each day.' ...|$|R
