40|$|This thesis invites geographers to {{pay more}} {{attention}} to public policy research by addressing the need to rethink fiscal decentralization policies in Ghana. By applying “Simandan’s wise stance in human geography” and “Grix’s building blocks of social research design”, I developed a conceptual framework that unites two incommensurable ontological and epistemological research positions in geography—the positive and normative positions. I used the framework to investigate two key research questions. First, does fiscal decentralization actually work in Ghana? Through quantitative analysis of empirical revenue and expenditure data (1994 - 2011) of local governments in Ghana, this study reveals significant issues of inefficiency, inequity, and unaccountability. Local governments generate less revenue, and therefore depend largely on central government transfers for developing their jurisdictions. Worse yet, these transfers are highly unpredictable in terms of amount and timing. Even though a multivariate regression analysis revealed that these transfers are apolitical, the <b>actual</b> <b>disbursement</b> formula tends to focus on equality instead of equity. Additionally, the unclear expenditure assignments in each locality make accountability difficult. In view of these problems, I addressed the question: why is fiscal decentralization held out as a good thing in Ghana? By drawing lessons from Foucault’s and Escobar’s critical discourse analysis, I traced a genealogy of Ghana’s fiscal decentralization. I found that the policy is held out as a good thing in Ghana because of the triangular operation of multiplicities of power, knowledge, and truth regimes at the local, national and international scale. I concluded that although nation-states remains a necessary causal link in fiscal decentralization policy process in Ghana, direct and indirect international involvement have profound effect on these policies. Therefore, rethinking fiscal decentralization involves acknowledging the complex intermingling effects that global, national, and local territories produce...|$|E

A robust forecast requires {{an understanding of the}} resources available to support procurement of these relatively expensive antimalarials, in particular from the Global Fund, at present the single largest source of ACT funding. Methods Predictive regression models estimating the timing and rate of disbursements from the Global Fund to recipient countries for each malaria grant were derived using a repeated split-sample procedure intended to avoid over-fitting. Predictions were compared against <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements</b> in a group of validation grants, and forecasts of ACT procurement extrapolated from disbursement predictions were evaluated against actual procurement in two sub-Saharan countries. Results Quarterly forecasts were correlated highly with <b>actual</b> smoothed <b>disbursement</b> rates (r = 0. 987, p Conclusion This analysis derived predictive regression models that successfully forecasted disbursement patterning for individual Global Fund malaria grants.

First, simple descriptive statistics show that the noticeable delays in <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements</b> and the replacement of regular RTI funds by these special funds reduce the latter's scope. Apparently, money can't work unless it is spent and "additional" funds at the expense of regular funds will trigger no additionalities. We then set up an econometric model to derive some inference on the relative importance of different public support channels on the business sector's R&D spending. Though the estimates suggest that direct government subsidies to R&D-performing firms unfold great leverage effects, the dynamics of output growth as well as an R&D-prone high-tech industry structure seem to be more important drivers of the business sector's R&D intensity. Likewise, feeding special funds into the higher education sector will raise the R&D-intensity of the business enterprise sector only if and to the degree that such funds contribute to Austria's overall economic prosperity or foster structural change towards more R&D-intensive manufacturing.

Publicly suggested by Marshall in June 1947, and put into action about a year later, the Plan was essentially an extension of the Greece-Turkey aid strategy to the rest of Europe.

On 3 April 1948, President Truman signed the Economic Cooperation Act, establishing the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) to administer the program, and <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements</b> got underway. The focus was on promoting production, stabilizing currencies, and promoting international trade. To be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes.

Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC [...] - [...] it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid. A large portion of the money given was used to purchase goods from the United States, and the ships used to transport the goods had to be of U.S. nationality.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{understand}} the motives of the European Union (EU) as a multilateral donor and whether its aid allocations are {{in accordance with the}} stated goals and objectives. The research question is: Which motives determine the aid allocations of the European Commission, and are the allocations in accordance with its stated goals? The research question's relevance {{lies in the fact that}} the EC is the world's largest multilateral donor. Also, the international donor community is setting new and ambitious goals to work together for poverty eradication, such as with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Furthermore, the EU is different from other multilateral donors as it is based on a regional constituency. It thus becomes necessary to evaluate whether the goals of the donor or its own strategic interests determine the direction of aid flows. The theory states a three-fold of donor motives: recipient needs, strategic interests and recipient merits. Moreover, theoretical postulations indicate that multilateral donors are more likely to follow their goals than bilateral donors, as they are supposed to be independent of member states' interests. Nevertheless, the theory also states that multilateral donors are likely to be influenced by major shareholders or the aggregate of member states' interests. To answer the research question, the thesis conducts a qualitative case study of the European Union as a multilateral donor. The analysis is based on data on aid flows from the OECD, reports, treaties, agreements and existing literature. The thesis finds that the development policy of the EU has changed from focusing on strategically important former colonies to focusing on poverty eradication and embracing all of the world's poorest countries. However, the <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements</b> from the EC have moved in the other direction; while the strategic areas were in focus, the poorest countries benefited the most, whereas when poverty eradication became the main goal, the strategic neighbours of the EU were the main recipients.

The EU seems to be more preoccupied with rhetoric than action in the field of development policy, at least towards the poorest countries of the world...|$|R

40|$|A {{few years}} ago, many western {{companies}} {{were eager to}} consider investing in Eastern Europe and, more recently, in South Asia, where ongoing reform, large domestic markets, and cheap but qualified labor are transforming the region into a potentially fierce competitor for foreign direct investment (FDI). Although this growing interest was reflected in large commitments by foreign investors announcing major FDI reforms, <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements</b> have been modest. This reflects the investors'concern about the credibility of governments'long-term commitment to change. The credibility of policy announcements is important to investors because the returns from the sunk investment can be affected by later changes in policy. To reduce investors'concern, governments can send clear signals to show their commitment to change. The achievements of trade reform {{can be an effective}} indicator of a government's commitment to change as indicated by the strong correlation between increases in trade flows and increases in FDI disbursements. The authors examine how countries can design trade reform to speed up increases in trade. Countries can tailor their commitment to reform to foreign investors by targeting the design of these instruments to the source of their credibility problem. Governments face two credibility problems: 1) investors know the current government's policy preferences (whether they are protectionist or free trade-oriented) but ignore those preferences if the government will later have an incentive to change its position; and 2) investors are uncertain about actual government's commitment to a reform program. The model presented in the paper shows that the recommendations in favor of free trade prevail when investors know the government's preferences and have reason to doubt the government's commitment to a reform program. But in the most realistic scenario in which investors do not know the government's preferences and the policymakers cannot otherwise demonstrate their commitment to reform, a government actually committed to change may want to signal this commitment by subsidizing investments or imports if it wants to be competitive in the market for FDI. In this model, the quickest way to attract FDI is through an investment subsidy, but it is also the most costly [...] an import consideration for a reforming government trying to keep tight fiscal control.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess {{international}} donors’ attempts to use aid to promote peace in Sri Lanka. International donors have on several occasions {{made it clear that}} they will apply peace conditionality in order to propel the peace process forward. What is clear, however, is that the strategy has not been successful: the peace process derailed already in April 2003, and the situation continued to deteriorate throughout 2003 and 2004. Today, five years after the signing of the CFA, the peace process hangs in the balance of a fragile no-war-no-peace situation. This thesis is based on the presupposition that peace conditionality can be an important pacifying tool. On that basis, the purpose of the thesis is to assess why donors’ strategy has not had the intended effects in Sri Lanka. Why have donors not been able to buy peace? Have donors’ intentions to link aid to peace been carried out in practice? And if yes, why have the specific strategies and approaches failed? The analysis shows that donors increased disbursements to Sri Lanka as the peace process seemed to be moving in the right direction. However, donors failed to link aid disbursements to developments in the peace process once the situation on the ground deteriorated. In other words, donors were willing to dangle the carrot, but they were never willing to apply the stick. Donors did certainly note the poor state of the peace process, but this was not reflected in <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements.</b> Sri Lanka did largely receive the aid that was promised at the donor conferences in Oslo and Tokyo, despite the failure by the parties to comply with the conditions attached to disbursements. Unclear procedures and mechanisms reduced donors’ ability to implement peace conditionality. The vagueness of the conditions made it difficult for donors to assess to what extent the parties complied, and monitoring soon became a sensitive issue. Furthermore, the institutional set-up of donors made it difficult to respond promptly and flexibly to developments in the peace process. Most importantly, however, the analysis shows that major donors were unwilling to prioritise peace over other foreign policy goals. It was more important for donors to preserve the good relationship with the parties, or to combat terrorism, than it was to enforce the conditions attached to disbursements. The application of the stick did not fit into the broader relationship between the donors and the conflicting parties, and donors consequently made little effort to enforce the conditions attached to disbursements.

40|$|Numerous {{empirical}} {{studies have been}} devoted to analyses of diverse inflation processes and have demonstrated consistent patterns for money price relationships for various market economies. While these propositions may be valid for market economies, they {{do not seem to}} be holding for the majority of transition economies. Except for Russia and Poland, no systematic pattern for the money price relationship was detected in transition economies in the first half of the 1990 s, thus undermining the conventional monetarist view at least in the transitional context. If indeed this were the case, it would imply among other things, that traditional tools used for stabilization and control of inflation in advanced market economies may not be appropriate for transition economies. The main objective of this dissertation is to scrutinize critically and rigorously inflation process in post-communist Russia, and the strength, dynamics, and causality of the relationship between inflation and various monetary aggregates. In particular, we test, whether lagged inflation has been an important determinant of contemporaneous rise in prices in this transition economy. In addition, we test whether there is a significant relationship between inflation and various monetary aggregates, and whether the lower inflationary environment that emerged in Russia in 1994, and especially in 1995, has caused the transmission of monetary impulses to future inflation to become both, slower and weaker. Furthermore, in a twofold aim, we shed some additional light on the issue of the choice of lag selection criteria in causality testing on one hand, and the issue of suitability of monetary aggregates for influencing and controlling inflation via policy instrument, in transition economies like the Russian Federation, on the other. Moreover, since each segment of our analysis contributes to the evaluation of the suitability of stabilization attempts in Russia, the role of international financial institution under whose influence stabilization was conducted, is inevitably brought under the spotlights. In this context, the dual role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), of being the main coordinator of the Western assistance to Russia on one hand, and the main guide to Russian economic policy on the other, merits a special attention. Finally, suggestion for further research and conclusion from the analysis are outlined. The most important findings contained in this summary are delineated bellow. Our analyses of macroeconomic instability in Postcommunist Russia emphasises the necessity of coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Although Russia may not be an economy with a fiscal dominant regime, the study demonstratest hat continuing problems with balancing of goverm-nenbt udget have led to eventualm onetisationo f the deficit. The analyses presented in the dissertation reiterate the notion that monetisation of the deficit, rather than the deficit themselves has been affecting the price level in Postcommunist Russia. In contrast to earlier claims, this study produces ample evidence that lagged inflation has been an important determinant of contemporaneous rise in prices in Postcommunist Russia. Using very simple autoregressive models, economic agents were able to make consistent, unbiased, and efficient one-month ahead forecasts of inflation. Although not rational in the strong form of efficiency, inflationary expectations together with a prevailing inflationary inertia ought to have been taken into consideration in stabilisation efforts. The preference for the orthodox money-based stabilisation programs indicates that this was not the case in this transition economy prior to July 1995. The analysis presented in this dissertation illustrates that the influence of changes in broad money growth on future inflation is considerably weaker and more protracted as the new economic environment in Russia has become more stable. Our evidence suggests that, the systematic pattern for money price relationship is fading in the new environment. Also, the average speed of transmission from changes in the growth of ruble broad money to inflation has shifted from just over three months in the first two and a half years of transition to just short of five months thereafter. In addition, the models of inflation presented in the dissertation give a reasonably good short hand description of the fundamental inflation process in Russia. The results presented in this chapter also unequivocally point out that the choice of a lag length in distribute lag models can be critical for the outcome of causality testing. Among variety of ad hoc and statistical criteria for the optimum lag length selection, the Akaike's FPE criterion is found to outperform all others. Leaning on these results, the study found the existence of the feedback or bilateral causality between inflation and broad money in Postcommunist Russia. The findings question the wisdom of choosing moneybased stabilization as the optimal policy advice for this transition economy. Finally, this chapter argues that the IMF financial and good technical assistance to Russia in the 1990 s has been less than generous. Not only the size of the assistance might have not been adequate but also the timing and <b>actual</b> <b>disbursements</b> of these funds were in sharp discord with pledges. More importantly, the IMF made a number of serious policy mistakes in both design and the implementation of the reforms, which significantly contributed to a delay in stabilisation of the economy and were thus costly in terms of the loss of welfare to the society. However, the IMF, as a main guide and a coordinator of the Western assistance to Russia, has done just enough to spoon-fed Russia to the point of no return to planned economy and autarky.

40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} {{some key}} business cycle properties {{of foreign aid}} flows to developing countries. We identify two striking empirical regularities. First, aid flows are highly volatile over time [...] on average, {{two to three times}} as volatile as the recipient's output. Second, for most African countries, net aid inflows are strongly positively correlated with their domestic output. Outside of Africa, we find a similar, if somewhat less pronounced, pattern of aid procyclicality. To see why these empirical regularities are important, recall that output fluctuations in developing countries are much stronger than in industrialized economies. Indeed, we document that the gross domestic product of an aid recipient is on average six times as volatile as that of a donor. For developing countries, though, customary ways to smooth out the impact of output fluctuations on domestic consumption are likely to be very onerous. For instance, moral hazard and repudiation risk imply that heavily indebted nations are often denied new loans (or are asked to repay old ones) precisely when their economies suffer adverse shocks [...] see, e. g., Atkeson- 1991). At the same time, foreign aid is a sizeable source of income to recipients, especially in Africa, where it averages 12. 5 % of gross domestic product and constitutes the main source of foreign capital. In such an environment, foreign aid flows have the potential to {{play a key role in}} smoothing out developing countries' output fluctuations. Our results imply that, all in all, aid does not play that role. Admittedly, it might be argued that, except for emergency relief, the chief purpose of foreign aid is not to act as an insurance device but, instead, to fuel economic development, in which case it is not clear a priori whether one should expect aid flows to be procyclical or countercyclical. It is well known, however, that output fluctuations affect growth negatively [...] see, e. g., Hamilton (1989) and Ramey&Ramey (1995). Hence, even if aid were meant solely to help foster growth, serious concerns should nonetheless arise from the fact that aid disbursement patterns contribute to the volatility of developing countries' disposable income. Our findings are robust. Our data set comprises various yearly aid and output series for sixty-three recipient and eighteen donor countries between 1969 and 1995. We find few differences between the cyclical behavior of multilateral as opposed to bilateral aid disbursements, even though multilateral aid flows are relatively more volatile than their bilateral counterparts. Likewise, aid commitments fluctuate more than <b>actual</b> net <b>disbursements,</b> but both commitments and disbursements are procyclical. We also pay special attention to Africa, because it is the region where aid is largest relative to recipient GDP and aid procyclicality is most striking. We show that, regardless of the domestic output measure used, net aid receipts are procyclical for at least two-thirds of the thirty-eight countries in our African subsample and are countercyclical for, at most, two of them. Key components of African aid, such as grants or technical assistance, are as strongly procyclical as total aid flows. Finally, we can find no evidence that, among African countries, the procyclicality of aid might be a function of the recipient's former colonial power, choice of exchange rate regime or some other criterion. We complete the paper by analyzing the cyclical properties of aid flows from the donors' perspective. For almost all donor countries, we find that total aid disbursements are strongly positively correlated with the donor's output. In a clear majority of cases, however, those same donors' bilateral aid flows to the sample countries are not positively correlated with the donor's output. A corollary is that the procyclicality of aid inflows experienced by aid recipients is not the mere result of the conjunction of (i) positive comovements between North-South business cycles [Kouparitsas (1998); Agenor&Prasad (1999) ] and (ii) a positive correlation between donors' aid policies and their business cycles. ...|$|R
