5|$|Lågskär is {{occasionally}} {{visited by}} ornithologists for birdwatching, and {{to operate a}} bird ringing station which was established in 1964. They use the <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> during their stay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and <b>abandoned</b> <b>{{buildings}},</b> whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{were not}} allowed the luxury of sound stages; thus, they had to find <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> or {{landmarks}} to use. The exteriors of the climactic airport scene were shot at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport, while the interior scenes were shot at the Pennsylvania Convention Center (formerly, Reading Terminal). Filming at the psychiatric hospital was done at the Eastern State Penitentiary.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} decline with <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> and high elderly populations, the {{demographics}} of Old Louisville began to change noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who {{wanted to live in}} Old Louisville. The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E
5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner and site fidelity. Both species build a bulky nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in man-made locations like <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings,</b> quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|A {{historic}} preservation movement in Omaha {{has led to}} a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings.</b> At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{performs}} {{further research}} on the adoption records and uncovers information on a third sister (Perkins), who is apparently troubled and homeless. With Starkey's help, Mulder canvases <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> in a desolate part of town. However, the Dark Figure finds and kills the girl. After finding Father Gregory at the scene, Mulder believes that {{he is responsible for}} the murders. Under questioning by Mulder and Scully, Father Gregory insists that he tried to protect the girls' souls from the Devil, and that the fourth girl must be located. While the agents step out of the interrogation room, Starkey enters and demands to know the location of the fourth girl. When Gregory does not answer, he is burned alive by Starkey, who is revealed to be the Devil.|$|E

25|$|The {{plight of}} the Aral coast was portrayed in the 1989 film Psy ("Dogs") by Soviet {{director}} Dmitri Svetozarov. The film was shot on location in an actual ghost town located near the Aral Sea, showing scenes of <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> and scattered vessels.|$|E
25|$|High {{unemployment}} was {{compounded by}} middle-class flight to the suburbs, and some residents leaving the state to find work. The city was left with {{a higher proportion of}} poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed property values, <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings,</b> abandoned neighborhoods, high crime rates and a pronounced demographic imbalance.|$|E

25|$|The Ruins {{series was}} {{published}} in many fine art magazines internationally, including the cover of P/F (Professional Photography) while exhibits were mounted at the Center for Photography at Woodstock and the Photographic Museum of Helsinki. The Ruins, based on Matuschka posing alongside plaster casts of her body in <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings,</b> is considered her first major work known to the public.|$|E
25|$|Urban decay is {{the sociological}} process whereby a city, {{or part of}} a city, falls into {{disrepair}} and decrepitude. Its characteristics are depopulation, economic restructuring, <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings,</b> high local unemployment (and thus poverty), fragmented families, political disenfranchisement, crime, and a desolate, inhospitable city landscape. White flight contributed to the draining of cities' tax bases when middle-class people left. Abandoned properties attracted criminals and street gangs, contributing to crime.|$|E
25|$|However, crime {{continued}} to be a problem in Detroit long after Young's tenure as mayor ended; according to national statistics the arson rate in Detroit was 6.3 times the national average in 2003 and the murder rate was 5.1 times the national average. In addition, the majority of Detroit residents, including many blacks, have left the city, leaving a glut of <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> that have become magnets for drugs, arson, and other crime.|$|E

25|$|The {{dead were}} {{buried under the}} floors or in the rubble fill of <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings.</b> There are several {{collective}} burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.|$|E
25|$|Initially, opponents raised {{objections}} to the program's emphasis on demolishing <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> rather than seeking re-use or restoration of the sometimes historic properties. Others hailed the program for bringing much-needed investment to the city's many poor neighborhoods. However, initial results have been positive. Since 2000, the average home in Philadelphia has appreciated by approximately 30 percent. The housing market continues to thrive, and developers have created more than 4,880 market-rate apartments and condominiums {{in the past several}} years.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{ghost town}} {{consists}} of many <b>abandoned</b> <b>buildings</b> as in Bodie, California, or standing ruins as in Rhyolite, Nevada, while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in Graysonia, Arkansas. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as Aspen, Deadwood, Oatman, Tombstone and Virginia City are {{sometimes referred to as}} ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities. Many U.S. ghost towns, such as South Pass City in Wyoming are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
