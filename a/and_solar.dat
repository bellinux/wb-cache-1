5|$|By the 1890s, the {{observatory}} had become crowded by {{the rapidly growing}} university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street just to the south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> observation duties.|$|E

5|$|Design of {{the complex}} began in 2002, with {{construction}} beginning in 2003. After completion in 2005, the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability, the second city hall in the United States to earn that distinction. Environmentally friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> panels to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{retained}} {{all of the}} noble gases that were present at its formation except helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E
5|$|Germany has an {{installed}} capacity of wind <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> that can exceed daily demand, {{and has been}} exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012. A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electric power storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.|$|E
30|$|Increasing {{energy price}} {{is reduced by}} {{increasing}} <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energy capacities that are supported by incentive and regulation which surpass increasing cost factors for <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind generations. When incentive and regulation lose their impacts {{on the cost of}} <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energies at the medium period, newly generated energy capacities of <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind systems decrease in a few iterations but then they recover their increasing state. This state stems from increasing <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energy capacities that cause the increase in energy demand and reduce of energy price and profits such that model reacts to balance the system by decreasing supports (incentive <b>and</b> regulation) on <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energies.|$|R

5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) {{mission was}} {{launched}} in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind Earth. This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections.|$|E
5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the corona <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E
30|$|To {{study the}} nature of the weak {{activity}} of cycle 24, we examined long-term variations of geomagnetic activities, expressed by the Dst index, comparing with the SSNs <b>and</b> the <b>solar</b> wind data.

30|$|Increasing <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> {{wind energy}} {{generation}} capacities cause {{the increase of}} energy supply and reduce of the energy price that also increases the energy consumption and energy demand. Increase {{in the cost of}} <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energy in the medium period cause the decrease of the newly generated <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energy capacities and the energy supply. This energy bottleneck indicates that energy price will rise and energy demand will reduce in the same period. Energy supply, demand and price <b>and</b> new <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> wind energy generation capacities factors converge to steady state at zero value in small fluctuations.|$|R

The remaining 5% went into such uses as phosphors, metallurgy, and chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|This crater {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as a future site for a large infrared telescope. The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which {{could serve as a}} radio relay station when suitably equipped.|$|E

The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of great chamber <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south. The foundations of a rectangular building stand on a rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.|$|E

5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> sails, have already been developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of self-replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E
5|$|An {{in-house}} {{waste water}} treatment and reuse facility, organic waste treatment facilities, <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> powered energy were among the environmentally friendly practices adopted by the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters (OC CWG Delhi 2010). At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk. The World Anti-Doping Agency set up an anti-doping education hub {{in collaboration with the}} organisers. Construction of the Games Village as a whole however was marred by delays and organisational inefficiencies, leading to concerns as expressed by athletes and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) (see below).|$|E
