5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an <b>article</b> <b>that</b> Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page <b>article</b> <b>that</b> theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus grandis {{was named}} in 1877 by Marsh in the <b>article</b> <b>that</b> {{described}} A.ajax. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed. Marsh later mentioned {{it was only}} provisionally assigned to Apatosaurus when he reassigned it to his new genus Morosaurus in 1878. Since Morosaurus has been considered a synonym of Camarasaurus, C.grandis is the oldest-named species of the latter genus.|$|E

He continued studying Greek, and an <b>article</b> <b>that</b> he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822.

Journal of Controversies in Biomedical Research (JCBMR; www. jcbmr. com) is an attempt to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ in biomedical research. JCBMR is an online-only open access journal that will publish basic science or clinical research <b>articles</b> <b>that</b> meet any of the following criteria: a) original <b>articles</b> <b>that</b> demonstrate biologically plausible negative, neutral or contentious findings; b) original <b>articles</b> <b>that</b> challenge previously published results in peer-reviewed journals; c) original <b>articles</b> <b>that</b> show effects of compounds on disease models (either in vitro or in vivo) are contradictory to the expected outcome; d) review <b>articles</b> <b>that</b> critically evaluate and challenge established norms and offer possible solutions to the problem; e) any manuscript that will assist the scientific community to re-think and re–evaluate the established norm...|$|R
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the <b>article</b> <b>that</b> nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys.

While writing a draft script, Gerolmo brought it to Frederick Zollo, who had produced Gerolmo's first screenplay Miles from Home (1988). Zollo helped Gerolmo develop the original draft before they sold it to Orion Pictures. The studio then began its search for a director to helm the project. Filmmakers Miloš Forman and John Schlesinger were among those considered to helm the project.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} <b>article</b> <b>that</b> advocated that widening {{the beam of}} a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an <b>article</b> <b>that</b> has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E
5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a Mix <b>article</b> <b>that</b> they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
