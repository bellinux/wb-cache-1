A GSM phone encrypts all communications content using an encryption key stored on its SIM card with a copy stored at the service provider.

5000|$|GSM {{primarily}} encrypts communications content {{using the}} A5/1 call encryption cypher. In 2008 {{it was reported}} that a GSM phone's encryption key can be obtained using $1,000 worth of computer hardware and 30 minutes of cryptanalysis performed on signals encrypted using A5/1. [...] However, GSM also supports an export weakened variant of A5/1 called A5/2. This weaker encryption cypher can be cracked in real-time. [...] While A5/1 and A5/2 use different cypher strengths, they each use the same underlying encryption key stored on the SIM card. [...] Therefore, the StingRay performs [...] "GSM <b>Active</b> <b>Key</b> Extraction" [...] during step three of the man-in-the-middle attack as follows: (1) instruct target device to use the weaker A5/2 encryption cypher, (2) collect A5/2 encrypted signals from target device, and (3) perform cryptanalysis of the A5/2 signals to quickly recover the underlying stored encryption key. [...] Once the encryption key is obtained, the StingRay uses it to comply with the encryption request made to it by the service provider during the man-in-the-middle attack.|$|E

40|$|Tactile {{stimulation}} usually {{occurs as}} a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced {{before it can be}} processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time perceived as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an <b>active</b> <b>key</b> was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an <b>active</b> <b>key</b> press/ passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch...|$|E
