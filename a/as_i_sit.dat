2500|$|At The Amaz!ng Meeting 3 Penn and Teller {{were asked}} about the {{evidence}} for their secondhand smoke episode being faulty. Penn Jillette, with Teller sitting at his side, said [...] "What we talked about during the show was where the stuff was there", meaning that he was using the data {{that the government had}} when they instituted the ban, then said regarding this episode they were [...] "very likely" [...] wrong. Penn went on to describe [...] "a new study that came out of England, just recently, that seems to have more stuff about it" [...] and [...] "right now, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> here, there probably is danger in secondhand smoke". He {{went on to say that}} this was a small portion of the program, and their main point was their opposition to [...] "outlawing" [...] smoking in privately owned businesses, which they still [...] "stand behind 100%".|$|E
2500|$|Only 16 {{editions of}} The United Irishman had been {{produced}} when Mitchel was arrested, {{and the paper}} suppressed. Mitchel concluded his last article in The United Irishman, from Newgate prison, entitled [...] "A Letter to Farmers", [...] "For me, I abide my fate joyfully; for I know that whatever betide me, my work is nearly done. Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring of the rifle. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> here, and write in my lonely cell, I hear, just dying away, the measured tramp of ten thousand marching men—my gallant Confederates, unarmed and silent, but with hearts like bended bow, waiting till the time comes. They have marched past my prison windows {{to let me know}} that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin— 'felons' in heart and soul. I thank God for it. The game is afoot, at last. The liberty of Ireland may come sooner or come later, by peaceful negotiation or bloody conflict— but it is sure; and wherever between the poles I may chance to be, I will hear the crash of the down fall of the thrice-accursed British Empire." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had some}} time ago an epistle, part poetic, and part prosaic, from your poetess Miss. J. Little,[104] a very ingenious, but modest composition. I should have written her as she requested, but for the hurry of this new business. I have heard of her and her {{compositions}} in this country; and I am happy to add, always to the honour of her character. The fact is, I knew not well how to write to her: <b>I</b> should <b>sit</b> down to {{a sheet of paper}} that I knew not how to stain. I am no dab at fine-drawn letter-writing; and, except when prompted by friendship or gratitude, or, which happens extremely rarely, inspired by the Muse (I know not her name) that presides over epistolary writing, <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> down, when necessitated to write, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would <b>sit</b> down to beat hemp.|$|R

6000|$|She {{protested that}} he was mistaken. [...] "It {{is the only way}} to get close to these wild people. I begin to {{understand}} them <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> here beside this fire. What do you suppose Two Horns is thinking about as he sits over there smoking?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Touch {{me with a}} finger, {{touch me}} with an epithet, {{question}} my superiority <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> here drinking my wine at my pleasure,' said Rigaud, 'and I follow the letter and cancel my week's grace. You wanted me? You have got me! How do you like me?' ...|$|E
