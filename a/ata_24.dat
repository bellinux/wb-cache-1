40|$|There {{has been}} a marked {{increase}} in the detection of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) {{over the past few}} years, which has improved the prognosis. However, it is necessary to adjust treatment and monitoring strategies relative to the risk of an unfavourable disease course. This retrospective study examined data from 916 patients with DTC who received treatment at a single centre between 2000 and 2013. The utility of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) recommended systems for early assessment of the risk of recurrent/persistent disease was compared with that of the recently recommended delayed risk stratification (DRS) system. The PPV and NPV for the <b>ATA</b> (<b>24.</b> 59 % and 95. 42 %, respectively) and ETA (24. 28 % and 95. 68 %, respectively) were significantly lower than those for the DRS (56. 76 % and 98. 5 %, respectively) (p< 0. 0001). The proportion of variance for predicting the final outcome was 15. 8 % for ATA, 16. 1 % for ETA and 56. 7 % for the DRS. Recurrent disease was rare (1 % of patients), and was nearly always identified in patients at intermediate/high risk according to the initial stratification (9 / 10 cases). The DRS showed a better correlation with the risk of persistent disease than the early stratification systems and allows personalisation of follow-up. If clinicians plan to alter the intensity of surveillance, patients at intermediate/high risk according to the early stratification systems should remain within the specialized centers; however, low risk patients can be referred to endocrinologists or other appropriate practitioners for long-term follow-up, as these patients remained at low risk after risk re-stratification...|$|E
40|$|Cryptostegia grandiflora R. Br. Ã um arbusto da famÃlia Apocynaceae conhecida popularmente como âunha de bruxaâ. O lÃtex dessa espÃcie Ã pouco estudado e ensaios preliminares jÃ haviam demonstrado a sua aÃÃo sobre o vetor da dengue. Dessa forma, este trabalho teve como objetivo caracterizar o lÃtex de Cr. grandiflora quanto as suas propriedades bioquÃmicas e avaliar a aÃÃo de suas proteÃnas contra o Aedes aegypti. ApÃs a coleta, o lÃtex foi separado em duas fraÃÃes, uma insolÃvel constituÃda por borracha (97 %) e uma solÃvel contendo proteÃnas (3 %). AnÃlises por eletroforese demonstraram a presenÃa de proteÃnas de variadas massas moleculares, cujo perfil foi completamente alterado apÃs tratamento com agente redutor e predominÃncia de proteÃnas Ãcidas com pI {{inferior}} a 5, 0 (59 %). Algumas proteÃnas da fraÃÃo solÃvel foram detectadas na borracha apÃs extraÃÃo com soluÃÃes Ãcidas, bÃsicas e salinas. Na fraÃÃo protÃica foram detectadas glicoproteÃnas, atividade quitinolÃtica (58, 68 Â 4, 45 nKat/Âg) e de enzimas antioxidantes tais como Catalase (0, 254 Â 0, 03 ÂMol H 2 O 2 /min g), SuperÃxido Dismutase (886, 36 Â 0, 35 UA/g) e Peroxidase do Ascorbato (0, 389 Â 0, 03 ÂMol H 2 O 2 /min g). As proteÃnas do lÃtex tambÃm apresentaram forte atividade proteolÃtica em pH 5, 0 (5, 43 UA/&# 956;gP) a qual foi aumentada 6, 13 UA/&# 956;gP apÃs ativaÃÃo com o agente redutor DTT. A forte atividade proteolÃtica com o substrato BANA (20, 95 UA/&# 956;gP) e a inibiÃÃo da mesma na presenÃa dos inibidores especÃficos E- 64 e IAA demonstrou a predominÃncia de proteases cisteÃnicas no lÃtex. Proteases serÃnicas, aspÃrticas e metaloproteases nÃo foram detectadas. A atividade proteolÃtica foi resistente a altas temperaturas, persistindo em 50 % apÃs 30 min a 75 ÂC. Inibidores de papaÃna e tripsina parecem ocorrer no lÃtex visto que a atividade destas enzimas foi praticamente eliminada quando incubadas previamente com a fraÃÃo protÃica sem atividade proteolÃtica. O fracionamento das proteÃnas do lÃtex atravÃs de cromatografia de troca iÃnica (DEAE- Sepharose Fast-flow, pH 5, 0) gerou dois picos. A atividade proteolÃtica ficou concentrada nas proteÃnas nÃo retidas e foi residual no pico retido eluÃdo em NaCl 1 M. Os ensaios biolÃgicos mostraram que a fraÃÃo protÃica nÃo foi capaz de inibir a eclosÃo de ovos do mosquito da dengue <b>atÃ</b> <b>24</b> h, no entanto, foi capaz de interferir no desenvolvimento larval acarretando em 60 % de mortalidade apÃs 72 h. A mortalidade de larvas de terceiro estÃgio causada pela fraÃÃo protÃica (96, 66 %) aumentou apÃs tratamento com DTT (100 %) e foi reduzida apÃs tratamento com os inibidores de proteases cisteÃnicas E- 64 (36, 66 %) e IAA (21, 42 %). A atividade larvicida foi detectada apenas no pico cromatogrÃfico que concentrava a atividade proteolÃtica. Proteases comerciais inespecÃfica (pronase) e do tipo serÃnicas (tripsina e quimotripsina) nÃo foram tÃxicas para as larvas mesmo em concentraÃÃes iguais as da protease cisteÃnica papaÃna que apresentou aÃÃo tÃxica. BromelaÃna tambÃm nÃo apresentou atividade larvicida. Fotomicrografia das larvas submetidas aos diversos tratamentos nÃo evidenciou nenhum dano morfolÃgico embora tenha sido observada hipertrofia dos segmentos abdominais. Houve alteraÃÃo no perfil eletroforÃtico das proteÃnas larvais incubadas com a fraÃÃo protÃica do lÃtex e proteases comerciais (papaÃna, tripsina e quimotripsina). AtravÃs de anÃlise por microscopia de fluorescÃncia foi observada a presenÃa de proteÃnas em toda a estrutura larval, com algumas distinÃÃes entre as trÃs fraÃÃes protÃicas de lÃtex avaliadas. As proteÃnas do lÃtex nÃo apresentaram atividade inibitÃria contra os vÃrus da dengue tipos 1, 2 e 3. A aÃÃo tÃxica aguda em camundongos nÃo foi evidente em doses de atÃ 100 mg/kg peso corpÃreo, no entanto, a dose de 1000 mg/kg apresentou 33, 33 % de mortalidade <b>atÃ</b> <b>24</b> h. Esse trabalho mostrou que as proteÃnas do lÃtex de Cr. grandiflora possuem forte efeito larvicida sobre Ae. aegypti e a atividade proteolÃtica do tipo cisteÃnica parece estar correlacionada com os efeitos deletÃrios observados, entretanto, alÃm das proteases outras proteÃnas podem estar envolvidas na toxicidade sobre as larvas. Cryptostegia grandiflora R. Br. is a shurb {{belonging to}} Apocynaceae family {{popularly known as}} âunha de bruxaâ. There are few studies available about the latex from this species and preliminary assays had shown its action against Dengue vector. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the biochemical properties of Cr. grandiflora latex and to evaluate the action of its proteins against Aedes aegypti. After collected the latex was separated into two fractions one consisting of insoluble rubber (97 %) and another containing soluble proteins (3 %). Electrophoretic analysis showed the presence of proteins of several molecular weights whose profile has changed completely after treatment with reducing agent and predominance of acidic proteins with pI less than 5. 0 (59 %). Proteins from soluble fraction were also detected in the rubber fraction after extraction with acidic, basic and saline solutions. In the protein fraction were detected glycoproteins, chitinolytic activity (58. 68 Â 4. 45 nKat/Âg) and antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (0. 254 Â 0. 03 ÂMol H 2 O 2 /min g), superoxide dismutase (886. 36 Â 0. 35 UA/g) and ascorbate peroxidase (0. 389 Â 0. 03 ÂMol H 2 O 2 /min g). Latex proteins also showed strong proteolytic activity at pH 5. 0 (5. 43 UA/&# 956;gP) which was increased to 6. 13 UA/&# 956;gP after activation by the reducing agent DTT. The strong proteolytic activity with BANA (20. 95 UA/&# 956;gP) and inhibition of {{the same in the}} presence of specific inhibitors E- 64 and IAA showed the predominance of cysteine proteases in latex. Serine, aspartic and metalloproteases were not detected. The proteolytic activity was resistant to high temperatures, remaining at 50 % after 30 min ate 75. Papain and trypsin inhibitors seem to occur in the latex as the activity of these enzymes was virtually eliminated when previously incubated with protein fraction devoid of endogenous proteases. When fractioned by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose Fast-flow; pH 5. 0) the protein fraction produced two peaks. The proteolytic activity was concentrated in non-retained proteins and residual in retained proteins eluted with 1 M NaCl. Biological assays showed that the protein fraction was not able to inhibit egg hatching until 24 h, however, it was able to interefere upon larval development (60 % of mortality after 72 h). Larval mortality caused by protein fraction (96. 66 %) increased after treatment with DTT (100 %) and was reduced after treatment with cysteine protease inhibitors E- 64 (36. 66 %) and IAA (21. 42 %). The larvicidal activity was detected only in the chromatographic peak which concentrated proteolytic activity. Purified non-specific (pronase) and serine proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) were not toxic to the larvae even at concentrations equal to those of the cysteine protease papain that showed toxic action. Bromelain also had no larvicidal activity. Photomicrography of larvae subjected to various treatments did not evidence any morphological damage although hypertrophy of abdominal segments was observed. There were alterations in the electrophoretic profile of proteins larval incubated with protein fraction of latex and purified proteases. Larvae exposed to FITC-PL exhibited fluorescence throughout the body and only discrete differences were documented. Latex proteins did not exhibit inhibitory activity against Dengue virus type 1, 2 and 3. The acute toxic action in mice was not evident at doses up to 100 mg / kg body weight, however, the dose of 1000 mg / kg showed 33. 33 % mortality within 24 h. This study showed that proteins from Cr. grandiflora latex have strong larvicidal effect against Ae. aegypti and proteolytic activity of cysteine type seems to be correlated with the deleterious effects observed, however, in addition to proteases other proteins may be involved in toxicity upon larvae...|$|E

O processo de alquilaÃÃo com Ãlcoois foi realizado utilizando-se o cloreto de zinco como catalisador, na faixa de temperatura de 70 a 120 ÂC. A reaÃÃo foi conduzida em tempos de <b>atÃ</b> <b>24</b> horas, fazendo-se o acompanhamento da conversÃo da reaÃÃo em cada hora. Este acompanhamento foi realizado atravÃs do uso de cromatografia em camada delgada onde se observou a conversÃo do cardanol hidrogenado em produto alquilado. Ao final de cada processo, os produtos foram devidamente purificados e analisados atravÃs do uso de cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria de massa (GC/MS). Os rendimentos referentes ao uso dos Ãlcoois ciclohexanol, Ãlcool iso-amÃlico e glicerol nÃo lograram valores considerados de significÃncia tÃcnica. Com referÃncia ao uso do metil terc-butil Ãter (MTBE) como agente alquilante para o cardanol hidrogenado, duas rotas de processo foram investigadas: na primeira, foi utilizada catÃlise heterogÃnea atravÃs do uso de uma resina Ãcida do tipo AMBERLYST 35 WETÂ, tendo-se para isto construÃdo um reator de leito fixo. Foi percolada uma soluÃÃo de cardanol hidrogenado em MTBE visando se obter a conversÃo do cardanol hidrogenado em produto alquilado (6 -terc-butil 3 -pentadecilfenol), tendo-se realizado experimentos nas temperaturas de 50, 80, 100 e 120 ÂC, num reator de leito fixo de aproximadamente 30 cm de comprimento de leito. A soluÃÃo de cardanol em MTBE obedeceu a uma relaÃÃo 1 : 2000, numa vazÃo de cardanol hidrogenado e MTBE de 200 mL/h. O rendimento mÃximo da conversÃo obtida foi de 22 %, dentre os vÃrios experimentos realizados. O forte carÃter Ãcido deste catalisador foi responsÃvel pela quebra do cardanol em vÃrios subprodutos indesejÃveis ao processo de alquilaÃÃo. Com relaÃÃo ao uso do MTBE num reator do tipo mistura perfeita onde foi realizada a reaÃÃo de alquilaÃÃo do cardanol catalisada por Ãcido sulfÃrico numa proporÃÃo de 1 : 1 cardanol / Ãcido sulfÃrico, a uma temperatura de 60 ÂC, durante um perÃodo de 48 horas. Neste caso, os resultados mostram-se de relativa significÃncia tÃcnica, tendo-se obtido rendimentos de conversÃo de atÃ 70 %. This {{work has}} {{investigated}} the hydrogenated cardanol (3 -PDP) alkylationâs process {{through the use}} of the following alkylating agents: methyl terc-butyl ether, cyclehexanol, isoamilic alcohol and glycerol. The alkylation process using alcohol was accomplished with the use of zinc chloride as catalyst in the range of temperature of 70 to 120 ÂC. The reaction was conducted during 24 hours with the conversion yields checked up every hour. This check up was done {{through the use of}} thin layer chromatography and it was noticed the conversion of hydrogenated cardanol (3 -PDP) into an alkylated product. At the end of each process, the products were properly purified and analyzed by the use of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The yields related to the use of cyclehexanol, isoamylic alcohol and glycerol were considered insignificant. As far as the use of methyl terc-butyl ether (MTBE) is concerned as an alkylating agent for hydrogenated cardanol, two routes were researched: in the first, it was used heterogeneous catalysis by means of an acid resin AMBERLYST 35 WETÂ type. For this purpose it was constructed a fix bed reactor, in which hydrogenated cardanol solution in MTBE was percolated in order to convert cardanol into an alkylated product (6 -terc-butyl 3 -pentadecylphenol). Experiments were done at temperatures of 50, 80, 100 and 120 ÂC, in a fix bed reactor. The hydrogenated cardanol solution in MTBE has shown a rate of 1 : 2000, varying the flow between hydrogenated cardanol and MTBE 200 mL/h. The maximum conversion yield obtained was 22 %, among several experiments done. The strong acid character of this catalyst was responsible by the breaking up of the hydrogenated cardanol into several undesirable byproducts. In the second route, MTBE was used to alkylated hydrogenated cardanol in a stirred vessel reactor using sulfuric acid as catalyst in a rate of 1 : 1 cardanol/sulfuric acid, at a temperature of 60 ÂC, for a 48 hours period. In this case, the results showed a relative technical significance, with conversion yields up to 70 %...|$|E

Results. Compared to baseline, livers preserved with the current static storage showed severe ultrastructural damage, glycogen depletion and an increased oxidative stress. Normobaric perfused livers showed improved hepatocyte ultrastructure and ameliorated glycogen stores, but they still suffered a significant oxidative damage. The addition of hyperbaric oxygen produces an extra benefit by improving oxidative injury and by inducing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene expression. Conclusions. Preservation by means of the present innovative HHMP reduced the liver injury occurring after the current static cold storage by lowering glycogen depletion and oxidative damage. Interestingly, only the use of hyperbaric oxygen was associated to a blunted oxidative stress and an increased eNOS gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to test whether high-altitude {{exposure}} (HAE: 0. 9 % O 2 at 0. 47 <b>ATA</b> for <b>24</b> hours) was capable of increasing the systemic inflammatory markers as well as the toxic organ injury indicators in rats, with a secondary goal to test whether preinduction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 by hypobaric hypoxia preconditioning (HHP: 18. 3 % O 2 at 0. 66 ATA for 5 h/day on 5 days consecutively for 2 weeks) attenuated the proposed increased serum levels of both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ injury indicators. MethodsRats were assigned to: (1) non-HHP (21 % O 2 at 1. 0 ATA) +non-HAE (21 % O 2 at 1. 0 ATA) group; (2) non-HHP+HAE group; (3) HHP+non-HAE group; (4) HHP+HAE group; and (5) HHP+HSP 70 antibodies (Ab) +HAE group. For the HSP 70 Ab group, a neutralizing HSP 70 Ab was injected intravenously at 24 hours prior to HAE. All the physiological and biochemical parameters were obtained at the end of HAE or the equivalent time period of non-HAE. Blood samples were obtained for determination of both the systemic inflammatory markers (e. g., serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 1 β, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and liver myeloperoxidase activity) and the toxic organ injury indicators (e. g., nitric oxide metabolites, 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase). ResultsHHP, in addition to inducing overexpression of tissue HSP 70, significantly attenuated the HAE-induced hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia, acidosis, and increased tissue levels of both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ injury indicators. The beneficial effects of HHP in inducing tissue overexpression of HSP 70 as well as in preventing the HAE-induced increased levels of the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ injury indicators could be significantly reduced by HSP 70 Ab preconditioning. ConclusionThese results suggest that HHP may downgrade both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ injury indicators in HAE by upregulating tissue HSP 70...|$|R

In this prospective high altitude study, we aimed to gain new insights into the pathophysiology of HAR and explored whether HAR could be a valid early indicator of altitude illness. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 28 mountaineers were randomly assigned to two ascent profiles during a research expedition to Mt. Muztagh <b>Ata</b> (7546 m/ <b>24,</b> 751 ft). Digital fundus photographs were taken prior to expedition at 490 m (1, 607 ft), during expedition at 4497 m (14, 750 ft = base camp), 5533 m (18, 148 ft), 6265 m (20, 549 ft), 6865 m (22, 517 ft) and 4. 5 months thereafter at 490 m. Number, size and time of occurrence of hemorrhages were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and hematocrit were also assessed. 79 % of all climbers exhibited retinal hemorrhages during the expedition. Number and area of retinal bleeding increased moderately to medium altitudes (6265 m). Most retinal hemorrhages were detected after return to base camp from a high altitude. No post-expeditional ophthalmic sequelae were detected. Significant negative (SpO₂ Beta: - 0. 4, p< 0. 001) and positive (hematocrit Beta: 0. 2, p =  0. 002, time at altitude Beta: 0. 33, p =  0. 003) correlations with hemorrhages were found. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: When closely examined, a very large amount of climbers exhibit retinal hemorrhages during exposure to high altitudes. The incidence of retinal hemorrhages may be greater than previously appreciated as a definite time lag was observed between highest altitude reached and development of retinal bleeding. Retinal hemorrhages should not be considered warning signs of impending severe altitude illness due to their delayed appearance...|$|R
