40|$|Aristotle’s Naïve Somatism is a re-interpretation of Aristotle’s {{cognitive}} psychology {{in light of}} certain presuppositions he holds about the living animal body.

While the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) {{is the most}} commonly used index to track changes in vegetation cover, newer spectral mixture approaches aim to quantify sub-pixel fractions of photosynthesizing vegetation, non-photosynthesizing vegetation, and exposed soil. Validation of the <b>unmixing</b> <b>products</b> is essential to enable confident use of the products for management and decision-making. The most frequently used validation method is by field data collection, but this is very time consuming and costly, in particular in remote regions where access is difficult. This study developed and demonstrates an alternative method for quantifying land-cover fractions using high-spatial resolution satellite imagery. The research aimed to evaluate the bare soil fraction in a sub-pixel product, MODIS Fract-G, for the natural arid landscapes of the far west of South Australia. Twenty-two sample regions, of 3400 sampling points each, were investigated across several arid land types in the study area. Albedo thresholds were carefully determined in Advanced Land Observing Satellite Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM) images (2. 5 m spatial resolution), which separated predominantly bare soil from predominantly vegetated or covered soil, and created classified images. Correlation analysis was carried out between MODIS Fract-G bare soil fractional cover and ALOS PRISM bare soil proportions for the same areas. Results showed much lower correlations than expected, though limited agreement was found in some specific areas. It is posited that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fractional cover product, which is based on unmixing using the NDVI and a cellulose absorption index (CAI) proxy, may be generally unable to separate soil from vegetation in situations where both indices are low. In addition, separation is hampered by the lack of ‘pure pixels’ in this heterogeneous landscape. This suggests that the MODIS fractional cover product, at least in its present form, is unsuited to monitor sparsely vegetated arid landscapes. E. F. Lawley, M. M. Lewis, and B. Ostendor...|$|R

The study area is located within the Torfajokull central volcanic complex in South Iceland. This complex is composed by anomalously abundant rhyolitic acid volcanics, which underwent intensive hydrothermal alteration. Detailed studies of surface alteration of rhyolitic rocks in the area showed that all the major elements are leached as the rock is affected by complex mineralogical changes.

40|$|An {{image fusion}} algorithm, based upon {{spectral}} mixture analysis, is presented. The algorithm combines low spatial resolution multi/hyperspectral data with high spatial resolution sharpening image(s) to create high resolution material maps. Spectral (un) mixing estimates {{the percentage of}} each material (called endmembers) within each low resolution pixel. The outputs of unmixing are endmember fraction images (material maps) at the spatial resolution of the multispectral system. This research includes developing an improved unmixing algorithm based upon stepwise regression. In {{the second stage of}} the process, the unmixing solution is sharpened with data from another sensor to generate high resolution material maps. Sharpening is implemented as a nonlinear optimization using the same type of model <b>as</b> <b>unmixing.</b> Quantifiable results are obtained through the use of synthetically generated imagery. Without synthetic images, a large amount of ground truth would be required in order to measure the accuracy of the material maps. Multiple band sharpening is easily accommodated by the algorithm, and the results are demonstrated at multiple scales. The analysis includes an examination of the effects of constraints and texture variation on the material maps. The results show stepwise unmixing is an improvement over traditional unmixing algorithms. The results also indicate sharpening improves the material maps. The motivation for this research is {{to take advantage of the}} next generation of multi/hyperspectral sensors.

40|$|The best {{technique}} to extract information from remotely sensed image is classification. The problem of traditional classification methods {{is that each}} pixel is assigned to a single class by presuming all pixels within the image. Mixed pixel classification or spectral unmixing, {{is a process that}} extracts the proportions of the pure components of each mixed pixel. This approach is called spectral unmixing. Hyper spectral images have higher spectral resolution than multispectral images. In this paper, pixel-based classification methods such as the spectral angle mapper, maximum likelihood classification and subpixel classification method (linear spectral unmixing) were implemented on the AVIRIS hyper spectral images. Then, pixel-based and subpixel based classification algorithms were compared. Also, the capabilities and advantages of spectral linear unmixing method were investigated. The spectral unmixing method that implemented here is an effective technique for classifying a hyperspectral image giving the classification accuracy about 89 %. The results of classification when applying on the original images are not good because some of the hyperspectral image bands are subject to absorption and they contain only little signal. So it is necessary to prepare the data {{at the beginning of the}} process. The bands can be stored according to their variance. In bands with a high variance, we can distinguish the features from each other in a better mode in order to increase the accuracy of classification. Also, applying the MNF transformation on the hyperspectral images increase the individual classes accuracy of pixel based classification methods <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>unmixing</b> method about 20 percent and 9 percent respectively...|$|R
