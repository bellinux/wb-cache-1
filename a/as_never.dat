5|$|When Kurosawa's {{exclusive}} contract with Toho {{came to an}} end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him <b>as</b> <b>never</b> before.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{frequently}} accompanied {{his wife}} to church services. Third-hand reports say that he took communion, although he is usually characterized <b>as</b> <b>never</b> or rarely participating in the rite. He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non-communicants (as was the custom of the day). He ceased attending at all on communion Sundays after being admonished by a rector.|$|E
5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for Octopussy. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of Thunderball <b>as</b> <b>Never</b> Say Never Again, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before For Your Eyes Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.|$|E

5|$|Having been conscripted {{into the}} Confederate Ghost {{program as a}} child due to her psychic potential, Kerrigan is {{described}} in the manual for StarCraft <b>as</b> <b>never</b> having been given the chance for a normal life. Her rigorous training {{and the use of}} neural implants to control her mental abilities leave her withdrawn and introverted. Despite this, Kerrigan exhibits qualities of courage and daring, and is an effective tactician. She is also described as a moral character, exemplified in her opposition to Arcturus Mengsk using the Zerg against the Confederacy. However, after her transformation by the Zerg, Kerrigan is freed from her inhibitions—as well as her neural conditioning—and indulges her darker traits (though Heart of the Swarm implies that at least part of her villainy was due to the influence of a fallen Xel'naga named Amon). Her attitude, combined with her natural intelligence, makes her extremely calculating and manipulative. A hint of her former moral sensitivity is to be noted when {{towards the end of the}} Zerg campaign of Brood War, she states how she feels weary of slaughter for the first time since her transformation. Kerrigan has also become far more physically aggressive, relishing close quarters combat so much that at one point in the novel Queen of Blades, she begins absent-mindedly licking the blood of her victims from her fingers.|$|E

25|$|This was the {{beginning}} of their protracted parliamentary campaign, during which Wilberforce introduced a motion in favour of abolition almost every year. Clarkson, Wilberforce and {{the other members of the}} Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and their supporters, were responsible for generating and sustaining a national movement that mobilised public opinion <b>as</b> <b>never</b> before. Parliament, however, refused to pass the bill. The outbreak of War with France effectively prevented further debate for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors of}} this study believe that the {{mentioned}} agricultural crisis will only begin to affect us after 2020, and will not become critical until 2050. The oncoming peaking of global oil production (and subsequent decline of production), along with the peak of North American natural gas production will very likely precipitate this agricultural crisis much sooner than expected. Geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such <b>as</b> <b>never</b> experienced before.|$|E

25|$|Most of the palaces and {{temples of}} Palenque were {{constructed}} during his government; the city flourished <b>as</b> <b>never</b> before, eclipsing Tikal. The central complex, known as The Palace, was enlarged and remodeled on various occasions, {{notably in the}} years 654, 661, and 668. In this structure, is a text describing how in that epoch Palenque was newly allied with Tikal, and also with Yaxchilan, {{and that they were}} able to capture the six enemy kings of the alliance. Not much more had been translated from the text.|$|E
25|$|David Pimentel, {{professor}} of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, and Mario Giampietro, senior {{researcher at the}} National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy the maximum U.S. population for a sustainable economy at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy world population {{will have to be}} reduced by two-thirds, says the study. Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The peaking of global oil along with the decline in regional natural gas production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such <b>as</b> <b>never</b> experienced before.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the capture of the royal family, the National Constituent Assembly sent three representatives, Antoine Barnave, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve and Charles César de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris. On {{the way to the}} capital they were jeered and insulted by the people <b>as</b> <b>never</b> before. The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level. During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from the crowds, and even Pétion took pity on the royal family. Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence by the crowd. Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly exonerated of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnam War hastened the {{modernisation}} and Westernisation of Thai society. The American {{presence and}} {{the exposure to}} Western culture that came with it {{had an effect on}} almost every aspect of Thai life. Before the late 1960s, full access to Western culture was limited to a highly educated elite in society, but the Vietnam War brought the outside world face to face with large segments of the Thai society <b>as</b> <b>never</b> before. With US dollars pumping up the economy, the service, transportation, and construction industries grew phenomenally as did drug abuse and prostitution. The traditional rural family unit was broken down as more and more rural Thais moved to the city to find new jobs. This led to a clash of cultures as Thais were exposed to Western ideas about fashion, music, values, and moral standards.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{had a major}} impact; humans {{began to}} affect the {{environment}} <b>as</b> <b>never</b> before. Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans {{no longer had to}} spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.|$|E
25|$|The Jeff Tedford era {{began with}} a bang, as California {{defeated}} Baylor 70–22, {{and went on to}} finish 7–5, their first winning season since 1993. The 2002 team defeated three nationally ranked opponents on the road {{for the first time in}} school history including California's first win over conference foe Washington in 26 years, and won the annual Big Game against archrival Stanford for the first time in eight years. Another highlight of that year was the emergence of Kyle Boller, a senior quarterback who was a three-year starter under Holmoe, throwing for a total of 36 touchdowns and 38 interception. In his only year under Tedford, Boller threw for 28 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. In 2003 he was an NFL first round pick by the Baltimore Ravens. While Boller played in the NFL for the next eight years, he is seen <b>as</b> <b>never</b> living up to the high expectations from a first round draft pick.|$|E
