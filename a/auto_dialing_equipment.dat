5000|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer software technology {{at the end of}} the 20th century, many hardware-based telephony capabilities for <b>auto</b> <b>dialing</b> can be implemented in software. Voice modems are much less expensive and some computers have them pre-installed already. Touch tones, call transfer, call progress detection, detection of answering machine and voice mail, and other telephony card features, are available in voice modem-based <b>auto</b> <b>dialing</b> systems. For a simple autodialer supporting only a few phone lines per PC, telephony cards offer few advantages over simple voice modems.|$|R

50|$|The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company {{constructed}} a two-story building in 1924. The structure, which encompassed 18726 sq ft, was {{to house the}} main <b>dial</b> <b>equipment</b> for the new automatic <b>dial</b> <b>equipment</b> {{that the company had}} introduced to Tulsa in November 1924. The architecture of the building was Gothic Style. In 1930, the company added four floors {{to the top of the}} 1924 structure to house its divisional offices and toll terminal equipment needed for the underground cable that connected Tulsa with Oklahoma City. The 1930 addition was constructed in Zig Zag Art Deco Style.|$|R

ContactEngine makes its technology available to corporates via Software as a Service (Saas).|$|R
5000|$|The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 {{was signed}} into law, in the United States, {{in an effort}} to put {{restrictions}} on <b>auto</b> <b>dialing</b> systems. Since then, the FTC has taken additional measures to ensure that consumers can block robocalls and other automated calls by requiring expressed written consent from consumers in order to receiving marketing and other solicitations over the phone.|$|R
50|$|There are 4 {{different}} dialing modes {{depending on}} how software dialers selects the contacts {{that are going to}} be called and starts making the calls. Automated dialers such as those sold by Noble Systems, Avaya, and Convoso (formerly SafeSoft Solutions) can place calls using *preview*, *power*, <b>auto</b> <b>dialing,</b> or predictive dialing. The dialing modes are defined according to the campaign and type of business.|$|R
50|$|Southwestern Bell {{intended}} {{to build a}} two-story building to house its new automatic <b>dial</b> <b>equipment</b> in 1924. However, company engineers expected to add more stories {{in the future as}} the Tulsa telephone system expanded. They specified that the initial support structure be capable of carrying at least seven more stories.|$|R
50|$|In {{landline}} telephony, an 8P8C jack is used at {{the point}} a line enters the building to allow the line to be broken to insert automatic <b>dialling</b> <b>equipment,</b> including intrusion alarm panels. In analogue mobile telephony, the 8P8C connector was used to connect an AMPS cellular handset to its (separate) base unit; this usage is now obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|Destinations {{with numbers}} in {{non-standard}} lengths or formats may have required an operator dial the number or request assistance of an inward operator at destination. Rural party line numbers in manual exchanges were prone to awkward, non-standard numbering schemes like [...] "line 10, two long rings and one short" [...] which were gradually eliminated {{as the number}} of parties on a single line was reduced and the manual switchboard replaced by automatic <b>dial</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} keypad is the keypad {{installed on}} a push-button telephone or similar telecommunication device for dialing a telephone number. It was standardized when the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) system {{was developed in}} the Bell System in the United States in the 1960s that replaced rotary dialing originally developed in electromechanical switching systems. Because of the installed abundance of rotary <b>dial</b> <b>equipment</b> well into the 1990s, many telephone keypads were also designed to produce loop-disconnect pulses electronically, and some could be optionally switched to produce either DTMF or pulses.|$|R
40|$|Transformers play an {{important}} role in the efficient transmission of electricity. Regularmonitoring and maintenance can make it possible to detect new flaws before much damage has been done. Current systems can provide information about the state of a transformer, but they are either offline or veryexpensive to implement. This Monitoring system is primarily health monitoring equipment that can acquire,process, analyze & communicates the critical parameters to the concerned official who is at a remote placewith the help of <b>Auto</b> <b>dialing</b> unit. Not only the conventional technical data, such as current, voltage, etc., butalso other critical information such as frequency, oil temperature, oil level etc. of transformers is required bythe operators to ensure reliable power delivery and to assist the day-to-day decision making activities. Thus,the system increases the reliability of distribution network...|$|R
50|$|Like a {{dial tone}} or busy signal, the SIT is an in-band signal {{intended}} both {{to be heard}} by the caller, and to be detected by automated <b>dialing</b> <b>equipment</b> to determine a call failed. In North America, the AT&T/Bellcore SIT standard allows the frequency and duration of the tones to vary slightly - making eight distinct messages specifically for automated equipment; indicating not only the call failed, but also the specific reason for the failure (e.g., disconnected number, busy circuits, dialing error, etc.). The equipment can then make an intelligent choice {{about what to do}} next. If the circuits were busy, calling back later makes sense; if the number was disconnected, then the calling back is futile. The eight SIT signals are defined below and accompanied by audio files.|$|R
50|$|With the gear-up {{for the war}} effort, {{demand for}} {{telephone}} services increased dramatically. The ranks of company employees to meet that demand, however, were thinned by military call-ups. Caught without <b>dial</b> <b>equipment</b> {{in a situation where}} new equipment was impossible to procure, Rochester Telephone had difficulty handling the growing volume of calls. Customers were asked to limit the duration of their calls, and tones sounded every three minutes on the line to remind them to get off the phone. On long-distance calls, operators broke in every five minutes to tell callers that others were waiting to use the lines. In addition, Rochester Telephone received many orders for the installation of new equipment which it was unable to fill. By the war's end, the company's waiting list had grown to include 8,000 names.|$|R

50|$|A {{collect call}} in Canada, Pakistan, and the United States, {{also known as}} a reverse charge call {{in other parts of the}} English-speaking world, is a {{telephone}} call in which the calling party wants to place a call at the called party's expense. In the past, collect calls were only possible as an operator-assisted call, but with the introduction of computer-based telephone <b>dialing</b> <b>equipment,</b> it is now possible to place a collect call without using an operator, which is called automated operator services (AOS) as opposed to Home Country Direct (HCD). Several companies offer services to place collect calls that compete with local service providers. Collect calls can be made from almost any public pay telephone in the world by following directions posted on or near the phone. Collect calling has been in constant decline since the advent of cellular phones and VOIP products, which can offer cheaper international rates.|$|R
50|$|The dialing codes used by trunk {{operators}} to connect calls were originally assigned and established to ensure speed with pulse <b>dialing</b> <b>equipment.</b> With {{the advent of}} subscriber dialed calls, numbering patterns were reassigned to provide for mnemonic methods of improving customer performance. Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes all began with 0. The largest cities, which had seven digit local numbers, were allocated special codes - London, 01; Birmingham, 021; etc. Smaller towns were typically allocated a code based on the first letters of their name, translated into digits on the telephone dial. For example, OXford translated into 09 on the British phone dial, so the original STD code for Oxford was 0096. However, because of subscriber dialing errors, there was an early decision to eliminate codes that began with 00 and Oxford soon became 0865, the sequence 86 designating the first two letter of university.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, The Durham Life Insurance Company {{purchased}} WRCO outright {{from the}} Wynne Company and the station's call letters were altered to WPTF. The new owners {{were given a}} permit to increase their power to 500 watts and to move to 720 on the <b>dial.</b> New <b>equipment</b> was purchased and the operations were moved to {{the basement of the}} old Durham Life building.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special subscriber trunk <b>dialing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|R

40|$|The article aims at underlining the {{valuable}} {{potential of the}} computer-assisted telephone interviewing as a marketing research technique. Representing only 5 % of the total market research turnover in Romania, in the year 2001, the ad hoc quantitative telephone interviewing has a significant development potential in Romania based {{on the evolution of}} the IT and mobile communication technologies. The telephone and personal interviews are compared. The specific advantages of the CATI technique are analyzed, as well as the main drawbacks. The evolution in the field of CATI software is illustrated by means of a short example - the Win Cati solution that is running in Windows and provides functionalities in line with the best practices in marketing research. The possible improvements of CATI are reflected by the experience of IPSOS-ASI and Booth Research, two cases of research organizations that have applied the SPSS solutions for the enhancement of CATI productivity and efficiency. The article also focuses on several examples of regulations that are applied to telephone interviews. Specifically, these regulations are the ICC/ESOMAR International Code of Marketing and Social Research Practice, the MRS Code of Conduct and the MRS Code of Practice for Automated <b>Dialing</b> <b>Equipment.</b> While the pessimists will declare that the evolution of the Web will lead to the end of CATI, the optimists will support the idea of the combined application of CATI and Web survey techniques.

40|$|The Automatic Dialing system {{purchased}} by D 0 {{is intended to}} help make the D 0 cryogenic system operate unattended by cryogenic operating personnel. The auto dialer is completely programmable and is voice synthesized. The auto dialer was purchased with 32 bistable inputs, but is expandable to 64 bistable inputs with the purchase of more electronic cards at an approximate cost of $ 260 per card (8 bistable inputs). The auto dialer also has the capability for analog inputs, analog outputs, and bistable outputs none of which D 0 uses or intends to use. The auto dialer can be called on its operating phone line to describe current alarms with the proper password.
