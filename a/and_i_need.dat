I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

"Bounce" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} as a digital extended play (EP)—which included a remix by DJ Green Lantern—on 27 May 2013 in selected {{countries such as}} France, while the release in several other countries were postponed to a later date. The delays prompted Azalea's fans to campaign an earlier release of the single; in a press release, Azalea explained: [...] "The problem with kids– and I {{was one of these}} people too– is that they think they work in the industry and know how it all works. They're like, 'put 'Bounce' out now or it's gonna flop!'. I'm like, 'I need to promote it first or it's gonna flop!'.

She then {{appeared}} in Killshot with Mickey Rourke, which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009. While promoting Nights in Rodanthe, she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was [...] "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy." [...] Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, [...] "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. Between you and me, I don't have anything else coming out." [...] Despite her concerns with being typecast, Lane signed on to Secretariat (2010), a Disney film about the relationship between the 1973 Triple Crown-winning racehorse and his owner, Penny Chenery, whom Lane portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the song [...] "recalls the synth-gloom {{ambience}} of Britney's 2007 gem, Blackout." [...] He also compared the riff to AC/DC's [...] "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" [...] (1976). The hook was noted by Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times to be reminiscent of [...] "(I Just) Died in Your Arms" [...] (1986) by Cutting Crew. Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song had a [...] "clubby and au courant" [...] feel, comparable to [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010) by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc., [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is set in the}} compound meter time signature, with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute. Lyrically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor. The chorus revolves around pick-up lines; Spears sings, [...] "If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?" [...] and [...] "'Cause you feel like paradise, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> a vacation tonight." [...] James Montgomery of MTV compared the feeling of the lyrics to that of [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (2009).|$|E

500|$|On 4 June 2013, Azalea {{confirmed}} that British recording artist Rita Ora would feature on her debut studio The New Classic, after previously announcing Ora's feature on 26 December 2012. She stated, [...] "I had {{a song in}} mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> {{a woman with a}} big voice to sing the chorus because I can't do it". Azalea then asked Perry if she could record [...] "Black Widow" [...] for her album, which Perry then agreed to. The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record [...] "Black Widow" [...] as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, [...] "It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice is awesome. The sky's the limit for Rita. Rita's a superstar and she will only get bigger. Rita is a great fit. Her voice can blow people away." [...] Azalea and Ora then begun recording [...] "Black Widow" [...] in November 2013 after the MTV Europe Music Awards, and completed it in January 2014.|$|E

"Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> some air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your lips together and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus {{a number of things that}} give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ All the things I try to hide." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to keep the full details of the story from Paramount Pictures and avoid the {{restrictive}} censorship of the Breen Code, they submitted the script a few pages at a time.

[...] He was appointed the 74th justice of the Michigan Supreme Court by [...] Williams to fill Emerson R.
