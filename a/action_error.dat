40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{automatic}} analysis and segmentation of meetings. A meeting is analysed {{in terms of}} individual behaviours and group interactions, in order to decompose each meeting in a sequence of relevant phases, named meeting actions. Three feature families are extracted from multimodal recordings: prosody from individual lapel microphone signals, speaker activity from microphone array data and lexical features from textual transcripts. A statistical approach is then used to relate low-level features {{with a set of}} abstract categories. In order to provide a flexible and powerful framework, we have employed a dynamic Bayesian network based model, characterized by multiple stream processing and flexible state duration modelling.

It has two new features: (1) being able to deal with a large number of slots and (2) being able to take into account some aspects of the user's affective state in deriving the adaptive dialogue strategies. Our implemented dialogue manager prototype can handle hundreds of slots; each slot might have many values.

The capacity to process errors is typically found to rely on sites in the medial frontal cortex. However, it remains to be determined whether responses at these sites are driven primarily by <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> themselves or by the affective consequences normally associated with their commission. Using an experimental paradigm that disentangles <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> and the valence of their affective consequences, we demonstrate that sites in the medial frontal cortex (MFC), including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), respond to <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> independent of the valence of their consequences. The strength of this response was negatively correlated with the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. We also demonstrate a main effect of self-identification by showing that errors committed by friends and foes elicited significantly different BOLD responses in a separate region of the middle anterior cingulate cortex (mACC). These results suggest that the way we look at others plays a critical role in determining patterns of brain activation during error observation.

40|$|Abstract—Multiparty {{meetings}} are a ubiquitous feature of organizations, {{and there are}} considerable economic benefits that would arise from their automatic analysis and structuring. In this paper, we {{are concerned with the}} segmentation and structuring of meetings (recorded using multiple cameras and microphones) into sequences of group meeting actions such as monologue, discussion and presentation. We outline four families of multimodal features based on speaker turns, lexical transcription, prosody, and visual motion that are extracted from the raw audio and video recordings. We relate these low-level features to more complex group behaviors using a multistream modelling framework based on multistream dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). This results in an effective approach to the segmentation problem, resulting in an <b>action</b> <b>error</b> rate of 12. 2 %, compared with 43 % using an approach based on hidden Markov models. Moreover, the multistream DBN developed here leaves scope for many further improvements and extensions. Index Terms—Multimodal, multistream, meeting actions. I...|$|E
40|$|Relative to our {{understanding}} of the memory and language deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), little is known about problems with everyday action performance (i. e., meal preparation, groom-ing). The resource theory proposes that everyday action problems are best explained by a unitary deficit in general cognitive resources. However, recent research suggests that omission and commission errors may reflect dissociable aspects of action impairment, with only omissions associated with resource limitations. This study examined everyday action performance in 70 participants with AD who also underwent a neuropsychological evaluation. First, correlation and principal component analyses were performed to examine the construct(s) that might explain everyday action impairment. Second, relations between everyday task component(s) and neuropsychological tests were examined by using correlation and regression analyses. Third, differences in everyday <b>action</b> <b>error</b> patterns were examined among participants of comparable overall impairment levels.

40|$|Background & objective: Human {{error is}} one of the main causes of accidents. Due to the {{unreliability}} of the human element and the high-risk nature of demining operations, this study aimed to assess and manage human errors likely to occur in such operations. Methods: This study was performed at a demining site in war zones located in the West of Iran. After acquiring an initial familiarity with the operations, methods, and tools of clearing minefields, job task related to clearing landmines were specified. Next, these tasks were studied using HTA and related possible errors were assessed using ATHEANA. Results: de-mining task was composed of four main operations, including primary detection, technical identification, investigation, and neutralization. There were found four main reasons for accidents occurring in such operations; walking on the mines, leaving mines with no <b>action,</b> <b>error</b> in neutralizing operation and environmental explosion. The possibility of human error in mine clearance operations was calculated as 0. 010. Conclusion: The main causes of human error in de-mining operations can be attributed to various factors such as poor weather and operating conditions like outdoor work, inappropriate personal protective equipment, personality characteristics, insufficient accuracy in the work, and insufficient time available. To reduce the probability of human error in de-mining operations, the aforementioned factors should be managed properly. ...|$|E

Awareness for everyday task performance and cognitive functioning was also assessed with questionnaire discrepancy scores, and a neuropsychological test protocol was administered. Dementia participants were aware of and corrected a significantly smaller proportion of errors compared to controls (z 5 24. 59, p,. 001). Awareness and correction of <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> was not significantly correlated {{with the number of}} naturalistic errors committed, questionnaire discrepancy scores, or neuropsychological test data.

Taken together these data suggest that error awareness and correction during the course of action is not related to error production or awareness measured via questionnaire discrepancy scores.

40|$|Visual object {{similarity}}, action {{similarity and}} semantic information {{are believed to}} influence both object naming and action production. The Naming and Action Model (NAM) developed by Yoon, Heinke, and Humphreys (2002) suggests that naming objects requires access to semantics, but {{that there are two}} routes to action production; an indirect route via semantics, and a direct route that bypasses semantics. For example, when presented with a known object like a hammer, one may retrieve action information from the representational knowledge of its function or directly from its visual characteristics. Past research suggests that producing actions with known objects relies mostly on using the direct route and producing actions with novel objects relies mostly on using the indirect route via semantics. However, this has not been clearly shown. Therefore, the current study examines the role of semantics on object naming and producing actions when training on novel object-action associations. Participants were asked to learn novel object-action associations that were labeled with either the names of semantically similar items or semantically dissimilar items. After an initial learning session, participants named the objects, produced novel actions with the objects and produced novel actions with a cylinder in response to the previously learned labels. Participants then practiced the actions with the objects over three sessions. During the final session, participants were given a reminder of the object-action associations and then they were tested on them again. Results showed that before and after practice, participants made more naming <b>errors</b> and <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> with the cylinder for objects associated with semantically similar labels than objects associated with semantically dissimilar labels. This suggests that when naming objects and producing actions with the cylinder before and after practice, participants were likely relying on the semantic route. However, when participants produced actions with the objects, the pattern of results was different. Before practice, participants made more <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> with objects associated with semantically similar labels than objects associated with semantically dissimilar labels. After practice, participants made equivalent numbers of <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> for objects associated with semantically similar and dissimilar labels.

Eight clinicians from a large health trust underwent extensive semi- structured interviews to understand their use of clinical documents, and their perceived impact on errors and patient safety. Samples of the key types of document used were analysed.

40|$|Introduction: Cognitive deficits are {{associated}} with functional impairment {{as well as with}} poor quality of life in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The main brain alteration in PD is a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated that basal ganglia dopamine system is important for cognitive and motor functioning. Dopamine transporter (DAT) PET and SPECT radiotracers have been successfully used to estimate, in vivo, dopamine neuronal loss in humans. Objectives: The present study is aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} cognitive impairment and striatal dopamine neuronal loss, as estimated by [99 mTc]-TRODAT- 1 SPECT in PD patients. Methods: Fifteen PD patients were scanned with [99 mTc]-TRODAT- 1 SPECT (Dual-Head-SPECT Hwakeye, GE). SPECT images were reconstructed with FBP and Butterworth filter 0, 40 c/px order 10. Regions of interest (ROIs) were striatum (STR) and occipital lobe (BKG nonspecific binding) and were delineated in 3 -mm transaxials slices analyzed according to this formula BP=([STR-BKG]/BKG), where BP is the striatal DAT binding potential. Neurocognitive tests, including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Ravens Progressive Matrices, Digit Span and Tavis 3, were applied to all subjects by trained neuropsychologists. Results: Striatal DAT binding potential (BP) was negatively correlated with the RAVLT tests 4 (R= 0. 57, p< 0. 05) and 5 (R= 0. 57, p< 0. 05), which evaluate verbal learning. Striatal DAT BP was also negatively correlated with the WCST learning item (R= 0. 54, p< 0. 05) and the Tavis 3 items, <b>action</b> <b>error</b> (R= 0. 52, p< 0. 05) and number of correct responses (R= 0. 47, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Although preliminary, the present findings suggest that striatal DAT loss is associated with a poorer performance on verbal learning and cognitive flexibility tasks. These results are in line with a previous study that examined healthy volunteers and found a relationship between caudate DAT density and performance on verbal learning tasks. Caudate/putamen segmentation in a larger sample is being performed by this group and will potentially provide more information on the relationship between cognitive deficits and DAT loss...|$|E

It tends to exclude how patients may create errors that influence their health. We aimed to identify the types of errors that patients can contribute and help manage, especially in primary care. METHODS: Eleven nominal group interviews of patients and primary health care professionals were held in Auckland, New Zealand, during late 2007. Group members reported and helped to classify types of potential error by patients. We synthesized the ideas {{that emerged from the}} nominal groups into a taxonomy of patient error. RESULTS: Our taxonomy is a 3 -level system encompassing 70 potential types of patient error. The first level classifies 8 categories of error into 2 main groups: <b>action</b> <b>errors</b> and mental <b>errors.</b> The <b>action</b> <b>errors,</b> which result in part or whole from patient behavior, are attendance errors, assertion errors, and adherence errors. The mental errors, which are errors in patient thought processes, comprise memory errors, mindfulness errors, misjudgments, and-more distally-knowledge deficits and attitudes not conducive to health.

This approach begins to balance perspectives on error but requires further research. There is a need to move beyond seeing patient, clinician, and system errors as separate categories of error.
