5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Stanford was {{appointed}} {{professor of music}} at Cambridge in succession to Sir George Macfarren who died in October of that year. Up to this time, the university had awarded music degrees to candidates {{who had not been}} undergraduates at Cambridge; all that was required was to pass the university's music examinations. Stanford was determined to end the practice, and after six years he persuaded the university authorities to agree. Three years' study at the university became <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> sitting the bachelor of music examinations.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E

5|$|Presidential {{elections}} were held within {{three weeks after}} the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency. The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes. He was elected President on 6 September 2008.|$|E
5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> swarming.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> natural {{selection}} {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions. This panel demanded that the Free Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Kenney {{became a}} student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, the Air Corps' {{advanced}} training school. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, and therefore a waste of time, but nonetheless <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> promotion in a ground-oriented Army. Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was particularly interested in low-level attacks, as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments. His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.|$|E
5|$|On 24 May, Abu Nuwar was {{appointed}} as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff following Annab's retirement. Glubb's dismissal {{was met with}} great enthusiasm among Jordan's inhabitants and Arab nationalists in {{and outside of the}} country. However, Abu Nuwar's ascendancy as head of the army was resented by its veteran Bedouin units; he was generally regarded as a competent staff officer, but did not have experience as a commander. As part of his efforts to modernize the army, he mandated that education was <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> advancement, an act which disproportionately affected Bedouin officers, many of whom lacked formal education. As a result of Abu Nuwar's measure, several senior Bedouin officers were retired or reassigned to non-command posts. To counterbalance opposition to him within the army's ranks, Abu Nuwar established the Fourth Infantry Brigade, which mostly consisted of Palestinians, who he believed would form an integral part of his power base within the military. Abu Nuwar's appointment also contributed to the increasing deterioration of ties between Jordan and the British government.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{was highly}} {{successful}} at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 {{he was offered}} the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (tekhnikum) in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (rabfak) attached to the tekhnikum {{that was designed to}} bring undereducated students to high-school level, <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> entry into the tekhnikum. While enrolled in the rabfak, Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine. One of his teachers later described him as a poor student. He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the rabfak in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire tekhnikum, and {{became a member of the}} bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy. All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his rabfak studies, it is unclear whether this was true.|$|E
5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>for</b> holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E
