5|$|In {{addition}} to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on {{the combination of the}} abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> <b>science</b> benefit from the concept.|$|E
5|$|Outside philosophy, Putnam {{contributed to}} {{mathematics}} <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> <b>science.</b> Together with Martin Davis {{he developed the}} Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> <b>science,</b> {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E
5|$|MIT awarded 1,547 master's {{degrees and}} 609 {{doctoral}} {{degrees in the}} academic year 2010–11.

5|$|The modern form of {{a binary}} logarithm, {{applying}} to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their more significant applications in information theory <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> <b>science</b> became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has ten colleges which altogether offer over 180 different bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs: the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, Charles E.

5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> <b>science,</b> it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, United College Sarawak (UCS) was {{established}} in Sibu at Teku Street. It was renamed to Kolej Laila Taib (KLT) in 2010. This college offers business, accounting, civil engineering, architecture, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and quantity surveying courses. University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS), located just opposite the KLT, commenced its maiden intake of new undergraduate students in September 2013. This university is established to provide human capital {{for the development of}} Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE). In 1967, Pilley Memorial Secondary School {{was established}} in Sibu. In April 1991, the school was upgraded to Methodist Pilley Institute (MPI) and it started to offer accounting, business management, <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> <b>science</b> courses.|$|E
