25|$|Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the <b>aortic</b> <b>sinus,</b> carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{coronary}} arteries {{start in the}} right and left <b>aortic</b> <b>sinus</b> and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more {{coronary arteries}} that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the coronary groove and continues on into the tissue as interventricular branches toward the apex of the heart. The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right atrioventricular valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left auricle and interatrial septum.|$|E
500|$|Baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the <b>aortic</b> <b>sinus,</b> carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched, which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation [...] As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation. There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true. Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: We {{assessed}} {{the results of}} a modified technique for aortic root reconstruction including preservation of the native <b>aortic</b> valve and <b>sinuses.</b> Methods: A modified technique for reconstruction of the aortic root was devised in which the native <b>aortic</b> <b>sinuses</b> are preserved and remodeled, the diameter of the sinotubular junction is reduced, the ventriculoaortic junction is reinforced with a Dacron prosthesis, and the coronary ostia are reimplanted. Since January 1995, this modified operative technique was performed in 13 patients {{with a mean age of}} 54 ± 21 years. The median grade of aortic regurgitation was 3; in 10 patients it was caused by dilatation of the sinotubular junction, and 3 had additional annuloaortic ectasia. Results: The aortic crossclamping time was 61 ± 18 minutes. In-hospital mortality was 2 of 13 (15. 3 %) patients, both deaths being related to complications of aortic dissection. In 1 patient aortic regurgitation increased to grade 3, necessitating aortic valve replacement. At a mean follow-up of 2. 1 years, the remaining 10 patients had stable aortic valve function with a median grade of regurgitation of 1. The mean New York Heart Association functional class was 1. 2. Conclusions: Aortic root reconstruction with preservation of the native <b>aortic</b> valve and <b>sinuses</b> allows symmetric reconstruction of the <b>aortic</b> <b>sinuses</b> and adaptation of the diameters of the sinotubular and ventriculoaortic junctions, thus optimizing aortic valve function. Moreover, it prevents contact of the aortic valve leaflets with the Dacron graft, which may enhance the durability of the repair. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 1151 - 6...|$|R

50|$|The baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. At low {{pressure}}s, baroreceptors become inactive.
