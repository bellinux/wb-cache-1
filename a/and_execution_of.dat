5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{political}} {{significance of the}} battle for future developments {{of the war in}} Bosnia, the battle was militarily significant for planning <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> Operation Winter '94 by the Croatian Army (HV) and the HVO aimed at relieving the siege of Bihać in late November and December 1994. Territorial gains made by the HVO and the ARBiH in the Battle of Kupres safeguarded the right flank of Operation Winter '94.|$|E
5|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} style of Carnivàle but {{questioned}} the approach <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the story. Its first episode set a new audience record for an HBO original series, {{but was unable to}} retain its ratings in its second season. It was canceled after 24 episodes, cutting its intended six-season run short by four seasons. It won five Emmys out of fifteen nominations in 2004, and received numerous other nominations and awards between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
5000|$|Dekulakization (раскулачивание, raskulachivanie, розкуркулення, rozkurkulennia) was the Soviet {{campaign}} of political repressions, including arrests, deportations, <b>and</b> <b>executions</b> <b>of</b> millions of the better-off peasants {{and their families}} in 1929-1932.

5|$|The Federal Council {{released}} a public statement on 11 July 1958 stating that although {{a world without}} nuclear weapons was in Switzerland's interest, its neighboring countries adopting nuclear weapons would force it to do likewise. On 23 December 1958 the Federal Council instructed the Military Department to study the logistics <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> attaining nuclear arms. However, efforts remained focused on study and planning rather than implementation.|$|E

5|$|The trial <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> Riel {{caused a}} bitter and {{prolonged}} reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange {{turned their attention}} to other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E
5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others were indicted on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.|$|E

5|$|During the 8th century BCE, {{the village}} {{was part of the}} Kingdom of Judah. During the days of Jewish king Herod the town was the {{administrative}} center for the district of Idumea. After the turmoil of the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt the town became a thriving Roman colony and a major administrative center under the name of Eleutheropolis. In the early 7th century CE, Bayt Jibrin was conquered by Muslim forces led by 'Amr ibn al-'As. Under the Crusaders in the 12th century, it was known as Beth Gibelin, and had a population of 1,500, compared to 100-150 in the average village of the time. It fell to the Mamluks and then the Ottoman Turks. In the 19th century, the al-'Azza family took control of Bayt Jibrin and unsuccessfully attempted to rebel against the Ottomans, ending in the exile <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> local leaders.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was {{confirmed}} {{and approved by}} Chahi. It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar {{to make use of}} the console's several processors: the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.|$|E
5|$|On Hitler's orders, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) (the {{intelligence}} {{branch of}} the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted {{on behalf of the}} SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar {{with a small group of}} soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a significant effect on the tactical planning <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the operation.|$|E

50|$|The assassinations {{that took}} place during summer and autumn 1941, {{starting}} with Colonel Pierre-Georges Fabien's shooting of a German officer in the Paris Métro, caused fierce reprisals <b>and</b> <b>executions</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of French hostages. As a result, the clandestine press was very discreet about the events and the communists soon decided to discontinue the assassinations.|$|R

5|$|The {{arrest of}} Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza in June 2012 {{provided}} further clarity {{on how the}} plot was hatched. According to Abu Hamza, the attacks were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47's and RDX, which were {{to be used for}} the attacks, was recovered from Aurangabad in 2006, thus leading to the dismantling of the original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to Pakistan and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for the attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from Karachi, but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks. David Headley's disclosures, that three Pakistani army officers were associated with the planning <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the attack were substantiated by Ansari's revelations during his interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The castle largely {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} the Hungerford family over the next two centuries, despite periods during the War of the Roses in which it was held by the Crown following the attainder <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> members of the family. At the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle, modernized to the latest Tudor and Stuart fashions, was held by Sir Edward Hungerford. Edward declared his support for Parliament, becoming a leader of the Roundheads in Wiltshire. Farleigh Hungerford was seized by Royalist forces in 1643, but recaptured by Parliament without a fight near the end of the conflict in 1645. As a result, it escaped slighting following the war, unlike many other castles in the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|When Gaveston without {{permission}} returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and The Earl of Surrey, {{with the task}} of taking him into custody. This they did on 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, acting with the Earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This criminal act had the effect of garnering support for the King, and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke is concerned, the seizing <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious affront to his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal in turning his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the King.|$|E
