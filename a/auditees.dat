50|$|Although {{this type}} of opinion is rarely used, the most common {{examples}} where disclaimers are issued include audits where the <b>auditee</b> willfully hides or refuses to provide evidence and information to the auditor in significant areas of the financial statements, where the <b>auditee</b> is facing significant legal and litigation issues in which the outcome is uncertain (usually government investigations), and where the <b>auditee</b> has going concern issues (the <b>auditee</b> may not continue operating in the near future).

50|$|An Adverse Opinion {{is issued}} when the auditor determines that the {{financial}} statements of an <b>auditee</b> are materially misstated and, when considered as a whole, do not conform with GAAP. It is considered the opposite of an unqualified or clean opinion, essentially stating that the information contained is materially incorrect, unreliable, and inaccurate {{in order to assess}} the <b>auditee's</b> financial position and results of operations.

2500|$|The {{evaluation}} {{concludes with}} the auditor determining, {{based on the}} evaluation, whether the recipient is a high-risk <b>auditee</b> or a low-risk <b>auditee.</b> A high-risk <b>auditee</b> is a recipient which has {{a high risk of}} not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk <b>auditee</b> is the exact opposite. For example, an auditor may judge a recipient to be a high-risk <b>auditee</b> because the audit reports {{of the past few years}} have numerous audit findings (e.g. specific situations of non-compliance with laws and regulations, serious deficiencies in internal controls and/or acts of fraud), or because the auditor receives news from various sources that the recipient is engaged in illegal activities, such as money laundering. On the other hand, the auditor may determine that a recipient is low-risk because its management personnel have a good work ethic, the auditor has received good references from external sources, or because the recipient has never received any audit findings. However, the OMB Circular A-133 has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk recipient. This includes the following: ...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} issue in auditing is provisioning of reasonable {{assurance that the}} financial reports are free from material misstatements. The auditing detection problem {{can be viewed as}} a two-player game between the auditor and the <b>auditee</b> where the auditor aims at eliminating misstatements, reducing at the same time his audit efforts, while the <b>auditee</b> aims at benefiting from fraudulent financial reporting and defalcation. In this paper, the auditing/fraud detection problem is modeled employing evolutionary game theory. It is proved that, given that the players have accurate information for the parameters involved in the problem, the auditing/fraud detection game is stable but not asymptotically stable. The case of the auditor being partially informed about the <b>auditee</b> firm is also studied and it is concluded that if the auditor is partially informed about the <b>auditee</b> firm, a more comprehensive audit is necessary to guarantee quality of audit. Finally, analytical results are derived concerning the impact of audit tenure on audit quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{literature}} {{on the market for}} audit services, to date no study has examined the determinants of audit fees for the smallest <b>auditees</b> in the market. This study therefore provides some new theory and evidence on the determinants of the audit fees of micro-firms operating in the UK manufacturing sector. A key finding of the study is that in the highly competitive market under consideration, independent small <b>auditees</b> willingly paid a premium to be audited by a mid-tier or a (then) Big Six auditor, with the latter commanding the higher premium. It is concluded that {{these findings are consistent with}} Big Six (and, to a lesser extent, mid-tier) auditors commanding a brand premium stemming from the (perceived) higher quality audit conducted by large auditors, for which small firms are willing to pay a premium in order to benefit from associated 'reputational' and 'signalling' effects. The common finding that the explanatory power of audit fee models declines as a function of firm size is also examined. The empirical analysis confirms this effect, but evidence is offered that, rather than resulting from model misspecification, it is likely that audit prices of the smallest <b>auditees</b> are relatively insensitive to variations in corporate size, which may result from lower incremental economies of scale and minimum pricing...|$|E

Given the current interest in auditor choice, analysis is also undertaken at the individual audit firm level and by industry sector. There is evidence of significant upward pressure on audit fees since 2001 but only for smaller <b>auditees.</b> Audit fee income for top tier auditors (Big 5 / 4) did not change significantly {{while the number of}} <b>auditees</b> fell significantly, consistent with a move towards larger, less risky, clients. Andersen's demise markedly reduced the level of inequality among the top tier firms but PwC retained its position as a 'dominant firm'. On switching to the new auditor, former Andersen clients experienced audit fee rises broadly in line with inflation, with no evidence of fee premia or discounting. They also reported significantly lower NAS fees, consistent with audit firms and <b>auditees</b> responding to public concerns about perceptions of auditor independence. There is no general evidence of knowledge spillover effects or cross-subsidisation of the audit fee by NAS. The combined findings provide no evidence to indicate that recent structural changes have resulted in anticompetitive pricing; the key concern remains the lack of audit firm choice...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with a primary and two secondary research issues. The primary issue pertains {{to the existence of}} a two-stage auditor switching decision process; that is the auditor change and the auditor selection stages. The two secondary issues concern the relative influence of variables within their respective decision stages. External auditors are engaged not only to comply with the Corporations Law requirement and Australian Stock Exchange membership conditions but also to reduce the degree of information risk assigned by financial statement users to financial statements prepared by auditee management. The decision to switch auditors may cause financial statement users to assign a higher degree of information risk to financial statements, i. e., the indirect costs of switching auditors. A substantial increase in these indirect costs may have occurred as the average rate that Australian publicly listed companies switch auditor has increased in recent years. However, prior research has provided inconsistent and inconclusive evidence with regard to the variables that influence <b>auditees</b> to switch auditors. To avoid mis-perceptions by financial statement users about the newly appointed auditors' attestation of the financial information prepared by <b>auditees,</b> a greater understanding is needed of the auditor switching decision process to assist in mitigating these indirect costs of switching auditors. In prior research the underlying suggestion why <b>auditees</b> switch auditors is the development of a mis-match of audit services demanded to the services supplied by the incumbent auditor. To overcome this mis-match, <b>auditees</b> after deciding to change auditors then select a specific audit firm that offers suitable services and possesses suitable characteristics. A suggested reason for the inconsistent findings of prior research is that there are two decision stages (auditor change and auditor selection) in the auditor switching decision process and past studies have examined, intentionally or otherwise, different decision stages. From a two decision stage perspective, there are three additional explanations for the inconsistent findings of prior research.
