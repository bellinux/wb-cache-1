We formulate research hypotheses and test them via a panel <b>analytic</b> <b>regression</b> model using longitudinal data from the frequent flyer program of a major European airline. We show that the proposed effects for the development of purchase amount over time and up-buying can basically be supported. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model could be an adequate instrument for the airline’s managers to forecast their customers’ purchase amount and up-buying patterns in the future. We contribute to literature by shedding further light on the questions whether and why customer relationship managers can expect an increased relationship depth over time. ...|$|E
40|$|A Bayesian linear {{regression}} model is developed that cleanly addresses a long-recognized and fundamental difficulty of factor <b>analytic</b> <b>regression</b> – the response variable could be {{closely associated with}} the least important principal component. The model possesses inherent robustness to the choice of the number of factors and provides a natural framework for variable selection of highly correlated predictors in high dimensional problems. In terms of out-of-sample prediction, the model is demonstrated to be competitive with partial least squares, ridge regression, and standard factor models under data regimes for which each of those methods excels; thus representing a promising default regression tool. By incorporating pointmass priors on key parameters this model permits variable selection in the presence of highly correlated predictors, as well as estimation of the sufficient dimension, in the p ≫ n setting. 1 The Predictor Distribution’s Role in Linear Regression 1. ...|$|E

We introduce a novel communication-theoretic framework for modeling and forecasting time series.

The path <b>analytic</b> <b>regression</b> with behavioral intention as the dependent variable predicted, in the chain of relationships, from the beliefs and evaluations to the cognitive structure, and from the cognitive structure to attitude toward the behavior, and then to behavioral intention. The factor analysis of the belief-by-evaluation compounds replicated the three dimensions found by Palmgreen et al. (1980). Analysis of variance and multiple regression were used to test for interaction. between beliefs and evaluations in search of the media typologies theorized by Palmgreen (1985). Interaction was found in a sub-population of the sample, but the four typologies were not, hence the hypothesized correlation between the dimensions of audience activity and the four typologies could not be tested. A series of multiple regressions on sub-populations of the respondents showed that the length of time a person has maintained a subscription influences the predictive ability of attitude toward the behavior. Three distinct sub-populations emerged.

40|$|Gas turbine {{off design}} {{performance}} prediction is strictly {{dependent on the}} accuracy of compressor and turbine map characteristics. Experimental data regarding component maps {{are very difficult to}} find in literature, since it is undisclosed proprietary information of the engine manufacturers. To overcome this limitation, gas turbine engineers use available generic component maps and modify them to reach the maximum adherence with the experimental measures. Different scaling and adaptation techniques have been employed to this aim; these methodologies are usually based upon <b>analytic</b> <b>regression</b> models which minimize the deviation from experimental data. However, since these models are built mainly for a specific compressor or turbine map, their generalization is quite difficult: in fact, regression is highly shape-dependent and therefore requires a different model for each different specific component. This paper proposes {{a solution to the problem}} stated above: a new method for map adaptation is investigated to improve steady-state off design prediction accuracy of a generic gas turbine component. The methodology does not employ analytical regression models; its main principle relies in performing map modifications in an appropriate neighborhood of the multiple experimental points used for the adaptation. When using gas turbine simulation codes, component maps are usually stored in a data matrix and are ordered in a format suitable for 2 -D interpolation. A perturbation of the values contained in the matrix results in component map morphing. An optimization algorithm varies the perturbation intensity vector in order to minimize the deviation between experimental and predicted points. The adaptation method is integrated inside TSHAFT, the gas turbine prediction code developed at the University of Padova. The assessment of this methodology will be exposed by illustrating a case study carried out upon a turbojet engine...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWeaving section have b 1 een {{shown to}} have an effect on {{capacity}} at roundabout approaches, because at weaving sections conflict and interference increases, resulting in a reduction of speed. The weaving section is the bottleneck of the traffic flow. Therefore, it should be given the highest priority in the capacity analysis. The current method of calculating the approach capacity at a roundabout mainly utilizes information about entry and exiting vehicles. Few studies are currently conducted from view of the weaving section in capacity estimation. The purpose of this research is to estimate the capacity of roundabout by modeling weaving gap acceptance at the weaving sections. For this reason, a total of 21 roundabouts which are located at the downtown and the suburb of Beijing are selected to conduct data collection. Significance analysis of speed at weaving sections has been conducted by means of the variance <b>analytic</b> method. <b>Regression</b> models of the entry vehicles and circulating vehicles are built up. Based on gap acceptance theory a new method is proposed to estimate the capacity of roundabouts. Furthermore, the relationship between the left turn and through movements on the capacity of roundabouts is established. The findings from this research demonstrate that capacity estimates with weaving section vehicles result in improved prediction of the actual capacity of a roundabout. Furthermore, the geometrical design of roundabout is another important factor which influence the capacity of roundabout, needs to be further explored...|$|R

Our framework introduces two factors that are highly relevant in deciding which method to use: (1) whether a reference value (gold standard) can be obtained and (2) whether the underlying measurand is continuous or truly dichotomous. Artificially dichotomizing a continuous measurand, as is commonly done, creates complications that are underappreciated in the literature and in practice. In particular, it introduces an intrinsic reason for the assumption of conditional i. i. d. to be violated. For most methods, this is not crucial provided the samples are random (or at least representative). But, also for most methods, it is, in general, not clear how one can obtain a random sample from the relevant population.

In some applications, however, we need to consider a broader class of covariate effects or the covariate effects on other statistical quantities such as the conditional 90 th percentile of the response.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{combining}} three <b>analytic</b> techniques including <b>regression</b> rule induction, the k-nearest neighbors method and time series forecasting {{by means of}} the ARIMA methodology is presented. A decrease in the forecasting error while solving problems that concern natural hazards and machinery monitoring in coal mines was the main objective of the combined application of these techniques. The M 5 algorithm was applied as a basic method of developing prediction models. In spite of an intensive development of regression rule induction algorithms and fuzzy-neural systems, the M 5 algorithm is still characterized by the generalization ability and unbeatable time of data model creation competitive with other systems. In the paper, two solutions designed to decrease the mean square error of the obtained rules are presented. One consists in introducing into a set of conditional variables the so-called meta-variable (an analogy to constructive induction) whose values are determined by an autoregressive or the ARIMA model. The other shows that limitation of a data set on which the M 5 algorithm operates by the k-nearest neighbor method can also lead to error decreasing. Moreover, three application examples of the presented solutions for data collected by systems of natural hazards and machinery monitoring in coal mines are described. In Appendix, results of several benchmark data sets analyses are given as a supplement of the presented results...|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} a new forecast aggregation technique. Adding to the well- known difficulties and uncertainty {{involved in the}} forecasting process, the aggregation of {{hundreds or thousands of}} forecasters’ opinions and expert predictions on social, economical and political matters makes the process even more difficult. Simple quan- titative data <b>analytics,</b> least squares <b>regression,</b> and maximum likelihood estimations are not sufficient to handle the dynamics of such data, which includes outliers, clusters of opinions, extreme values, and abrupt change of mind and predictions of forecasters influenced by news, recent events, collaboration or feedback from experts. The meth- ods developed in this work are based on a particular minimum-distance technique called L 2 E, which is popular in nonparametric density estimation that makes the aggregation robust to clusters of opinions and dramatic changes. Variance-stabilizing transformations are introduced to attain homoscedasticity for L 2 E regression improv- ing parameter estimation and overall aggregation. New normalization approaches are proposed to use when the aggregated values are unsuitable probabilities, such as values ∈/ [0, 1] and/or do not add to 1. Finally, data visualization techniques and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are discussed as aid to decision makers in order to understand “single” aggregated forecast values, obtained from the original big data set analyzed, and the trend of such aggregated forecasts over the forecasting period...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pregnancy-induced or gestational {{hypertension}} is {{a common}} pregnancy complication. Paradoxically, gestational hypertension {{has been associated with}} a protective effect against perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies in <b>analytic</b> models (logistic <b>regression)</b> without accounting for survival time. Whether this effect is real remains uncertain. This study aimed to validate the impact of gestational hypertension on perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies using a survival analysis approach. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 278, 821 twin pregnancies, using the U. S. 1995 – 2000 matched multiple birth dataset (the largest dataset available for multiple births). Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of perinatal death (stillbirth and neonatal death) comparing gestational hypertensive vs. non-hypertensive pregnancies controlling for maternal characteristics and twin cluster-level dependence. Results: Comparing births in gestational hypertensive vs. non-hypertensive twin pregnancies, perinatal mortality rates were significantly lower (1. 20 % vs. 3. 38 %), so were neonatal mortality (0. 72 % vs. 2. 30 %) and stillbirth (0. 48 % vs. 1. 10 %) rates. The aHRs (95 % confidence intervals) were 0. 34 (0. 31 – 0. 38) for perinatal death, 0. 31 (0. 27 – 0. 34) for neonatal death, and 0. 45 (0. 38 – 0. 53) for stillbirth, respectively. The protective effect of gestational hypertension against perinatal death became weaker over advancing gestational age; the aHRs in very preterm (, 32 weeks), mild preterm (32 – 36 weeks) and term (37...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies suggest}} that poor psychosocial job quality is {{a risk factor for}} mental health problems, but they use {{conventional}} <b>regression</b> <b>analytic</b> methods that cannot rule out reverse causation, unmeasured time-invariant confounding and reporting bias. Methods: This study combines two quasi-experimental approaches to improve causal inference by better accounting for these biases: (i) linear fixed effects regression analysis and (ii) linear instrumental variable analysis. We extract 13 annual waves of national cohort data including 13 260 working-age (18 - 64 years) employees. The exposure variable is self-reported level of psychosocial job quality. The instruments used are two common workplace entitlements. The outcome variable is the Mental Health Inventory (MHI- 5). We adjust for measured time-varying confounders. Results: In the fixed effects regression analysis adjusted for time-varying confounders, a 1 -point increase in psychosocial job quality is associated with a 1. 28 -point improvement in mental health on the MHI- 5 scale (95 % CI: 1. 17, 1. 40; P < 0. 001). When the fixed effects was combined with the instrumental variable analysis, a 1 -point increase psychosocial job quality is related to 1. 62 -point improvement on the MHI- 5 scale (95 % CI: - 0. 24, 3. 48; P = 0. 088). Conclusions: Our quasi-experimental results provide evidence to confirm job stressors as risk factors for mental ill health using methods that improve causal inference.
