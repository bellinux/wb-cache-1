40|$|This report {{describes}} a novel RNA-binding protein, SECp 43, that associates specifically with mammalian selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA(Sec)). SECp 43, identified from a degenerate PCR screen, {{is a highly}} conserved protein with two ribonucleoprotein-binding domains and a polar/acidic carboxy terminus. The protein and corresponding mRNA are generally expressed in rat tissues and mammalian cell lines. To gain insight into the biological role of SECp 43, affinity-purified antibody was employed to identify its molecular partners. Surprisingly, the application of native HeLa cell extracts to a SECp 43 <b>antibody</b> <b>column</b> results in the purification of a 90 -nt RNA species identified by direct sequencing and Northern blot analysis as tRNA(Sec). The purification of tRNA(Sec) by the <b>antibody</b> <b>column</b> is striking, based on the low abundance of this tRNA species. Using recombinant SECp 43 as a probe for interacting protein partners, we also identify a 48 -kDa interacting protein, which is a possible component of the mammalian selenocysteine insertion (SECIS) pathway. To our knowledge, SECp 43 is the first cloned protein demonstrated to associate specifically with eukaryotic tRNA(Sec) ...|$|E

40|$|Prions are unusual {{infectious}} pathogens causing scrapie {{of sheep}} and goats as well as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of humans. Biochemical and genetic studies contend that the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) is {{a major component of}} the prion. Limited proteinase K digestion of PrPSc produced a protein of 27 - 30 kDa. After dispersion of brain microsomes isolated from scrapie-infected hamsters into detergent-lipid-protein complexes, copurification of PrPSc and scrapie infectivity was obtained with scrapie prion protein of 27 - 30 kDa monoclonal antibody-affinity columns. PrPSc was enriched approximately equal to 5700 -fold with respect to total brain protein, whereas scrapie prion infectivity was enriched approximately equal to 4000 -fold. The ratio of prion titer to PrPSc remained constant throughout purification. Heterologous monoclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>columns</b> failed to bind either PrPSc or scrapie infectivity. Polyclonal rabbit prion protein antiserum raised against NaDodSO 4 /PAGE-purified scrapie prion protein of 27 - 30 kDa reduced scrapie infectivity dispersed into detergent-lipid-protein complexes by a factor of 100. These results represent direct immunologic and chromatographic demonstrations of a relationship between PrPSc and prion infectivity as well as providing additional support for the contention that PrPSc is a major component of the infectious scrapie particle.

A stable cell line was established that secretes a monoclonal antibody that binds to the Ca 2 +/calmodulin/enzyme complex with an approximate Kd of 10 - 9 M. The dissociation constant was increased by two {{orders of magnitude}} when calmodulin interaction with the enzyme was inhibited by Ca 2 + chelation. This differential reactivity was utilized for affinity chromatography of heart and brain phosphodiesterases on monoclonal antibody columns. Highly purified phosphodiesterases were eluted in good yield with buffer containing EGTA. The immunopurified enzymes from heart and brain exhibited specific activities of â 300 units/mg when assayed at millimolar concentrations of cGMP or cAMP. Calmodulin stimulated both enzymes 10 - to 15 -fold over basal activity under these conditions. However, analysis of the two preparations by NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an apparent subunit of Mr 61, 000 for the brain enzyme, {{in contrast to the}} Mr 59, 000 cardiac subunit. The observed difference was not an artifact of tissue homogenization because both forms were detected after purification from mixed-tissue homogenates.

In the LPS-injected mice, pilocarpine-stimulated saliva production was reduced by more than 50 %. In a tissue culture system, the LPS-induced decrease in the AQP 5 mRNA level was blocked completely by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, MG 132, tyrphostin AG 126, SP 600125, and partially by SB 203580, which are inhibitors for IÎºB kinase, 26 S proteasome, ERK 1 / 2, JNK, and p 38 MAPK, respectively. In contrast, the expression of AQP 1 mRNA was down-regulated by LPS and such down-regulation was blocked only by SP 600125.

The method gave low limits of detection (LOD), excellent precision and reproducibility. The method was optimized to give a total analysis time of 10 min for the three model s-triazine compounds at a sample throughput of less than 5 min. The lower LOD was dependent upon sample size, and for a 2. 00 mL sample was 0. 3 Î¼g/L at a S/N = 2. Good stability of the system was observed with within-day precisions of 16 % and day-to-day precisions of 16 %. This work also explored theoretical aspects of the coupling of these two methods. Assays and equations were developed for examining thermodynamic and kinetic properties of immunoaffinity columns. ^ A three step assay was used to determine thermodynamic and kinetic properties of antibody columns. The three steps were: (1) an initial application step in which analyze at various concentrations saturated the affinity column, (2) an elution step in which a step gradient elution buffer was applied, and (3) a regeneration step in which the antibodies were returned to the initial buffer conditions. This method allowed calculation of association equilibrium constants as well as association and dissociation rate constants for the antibody-antigen interaction in less than fifteen minutes per assay. Accurate on-column estimations of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of interest were shown. ^ Behavior of analytes at the interface of the <b>antibody</b> <b>column</b> and reversed-phase liquid chromatography column was investigated.

Heterologous immunoradiometric assays ('sandwich' tests) confirmed that NCRC- 11 and C 595 epitopes were co-expressed on the same molecule.

40|$|Biochemical and {{immunohistochemical}} {{characterizations of}} the epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody, JK- 132, originally produced against human type IV collagen {{showed that it}} was distinct from the previously reported monoclonal antibody, JK- 199 (Kino et al, J Biochem 1988, 103 : 829 - 835). The bound fraction of a crude pepsin extract of human placenta on JK- 132 antibody-coupled resin showed close similarity to type IV collagen in a triple-helical conformation {{in terms of the}} amino acid composition and circular dichroism spectrum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the fraction showed six peptide bands with molecular weights of 50, 000 or below, both before and after reduction. Four of the peptides reacted with JK- 132 on immunoelectroblotting, but none reacted with JK- 199. JK- 132 reacted with two additional bands with molecular weights of 100, 000 and 120, 000, which were not visible on direct staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R- 250. Two peptides (molecular weights 40, 000 and 15, 000) bound on a JK- 199 <b>antibody</b> affinity <b>column</b> were sequenced, and both contained the same amino-terminal sequences as alpha 1 (IV) chain. Conversely the sequences of three of the peptides (molecular weights 50, 000, 32, 000, and 23, 000) eluted from a JK- 132 <b>antibody</b> affinity <b>column</b> did not match either the alpha 1 (IV) or the alpha 2 (IV) sequence reported. Immunohistochemically, JK- 132 reacted strongly with basement membranes of blood capillaries in skeletal muscle tissues but not with the basement membranes of muscle fibers in frozen sections of periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue, suggesting heterogeneity or tissue specificity of basement membrane collagen. By immunoelectron microscopy, the reaction products were found on the basal laminae of endothelium and of smooth muscle cells around blood vessels. These findings suggest the presence of a new collagen chain associated with basal laminae...|$|R
40|$|Rotavirus is a {{major cause}} of severe, {{dehydrating}} childhood diarrhea. VP 7, the rotavirus outer capsid glycoprotein, is a target of protective antibodies and is responsible for the calcium-dependent uncoating of the virus during cell entry. We have purified, characterized, and crystallized recombinant rhesus rotavirus VP 7, expressed in insect cells. A critical aspect of the purification is the elution of VP 7 from a neutralizing monoclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>column</b> by EDTA. Gel filtration chromatography and equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that, in the presence of calcium, purified VP 7 trimerizes. Trimeric VP 7 crystallizes into hexagonal plates. Preliminary X-ray analysis suggests that the crystal packing reproduces the hexagonal component of the icosahedral lattice of VP 7 on triple-layered rotavirus particles. These data indicate that the rotavirus outer capsid assembles from calcium-dependent VP 7 trimers and that dissociation of these trimers is the biochemical basis for EDTA-induced rotavirus uncoating and loss of VP 7 neutralizing epitopes.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{against a}} glycoprotein presumably involved in adhesion of aggregating Dictyostelium discoideum cells {{have been used}} for labeling of the antigen at the cell surface. The antigen is distributed over the whole surface of the cells, apparently in form of small clusters. The antigen appears concomitantly with the acquisition of EDTA-stable adhesiveness typical of aggregation competent cells. In contrast, discoidin I, a lectin whose accumulation during development parallels EDTA-stable adhesiveness in another strain (NC- 4), is present in nearly the same amounts of growth phase and aggregating cells of AX 2 - 214, the strain used by use. Thus, no correlation exists in this strain between the expression of discoidin I and the development of cell adhesiveness. The 80 kilodalton glycoprotein typical of aggregation competent cells has been purified by affinity chromatography on a monoclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>column.</b> The purified antigen absorbs adhesion-blocking Fab from rabbits. Another antigen strongly reacting with the same monoclonal antibodies has an apparent molecular weight of 106 000 and is not detectable before slugs are formed...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Winged bean is a {{rich source}} of {{protease}} inhibitors. &# 13; The seeds of winged bean contain several serine protease inhibitors of which winged &# 13; bean chymotrypsin-trypsin inhibitor (WbCTI) is of significant importance due to &# 13; its dual inhibition of both chymotrypsin and trypsin. The purification of WbCTI &# 13; has always been difficult and a time taking process that involved large number &# 13; of steps and various purification columns. Approach: This study &# 13; was focused on the single step method of purification of WbCTI to homogeneity &# 13; from winged bean seeds using immunoaffinity column chromatography. Results: &# 13; WbCTI was purified to homogeneity using anti-WbCTI <b>antibody</b> <b>column</b> in &# 13; a single step which gave a single band on SDS-PAGE analysis and with almost one &# 13; and half times more yield of purified protein than obtained from previously mentioned &# 13; purification methods.

40|$|Itachi, a soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) variety with 0. 2 % normal seed urease activity, was {{recovered}} from a screen of 6, 000 entries in the United States Department of Agriculture soybean germplasm collection. No urease antigen in Itachi seed extracts was detected by double diffusion or by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Native gels stained for protein or ureolytic activity revealed no detectable urease holoenzyme. An anti-urease <b>antibody</b> affinity <b>column</b> {{was used to remove}} all detectable urease activity and antigen from `wild type' (cv. Prize) seed extracts. Affinity column effluent and nonchromatographed Itachi extracts both lack a species which comigrates with purified urease subunits in sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gels. Inability to detect urease antigen or urease protein suggests that during development of Itachi seeds there is no synthesis of urease protein or that, at most, its synthesis is 0. 2 % of wild type (Prize) ...|$|R
40|$|Capillary zone {{electrophoresis}} (CZE) in fused-silica capillaries is {{an effective}} analytical approach for the separation and determination of the transferrin (Tf) isoforms and thus carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) in human serum. Sera of patients with progressed liver cirrhosis are prone to interferences in the beta region which prevent the proper determination of CDT by CZE without additional sample preparation. Efforts to identify, reduce or even eliminate these interferences have been undertaken. Data obtained by ultrafiltration, affinity subtraction procedures using protein A, protein L and antibodies against immunoglobulins or Tf, and immunopurification of Tf suggest that the interferences in the patient sera are caused by increased levels of IgA and IgM and are best eliminated by immunopurification. Avian IgY <b>antibody</b> spin <b>column</b> immunocapture of serum Tf followed by CZE analysis of the stripped and concentrated fraction is shown to provide an attractive approach for CDT monitoring in sera with beta region interferences...|$|R

The {{present study was}} undertaken to investigate the molecular structure of HF. It was observed that the activity of HF was abrogated by treatment with reducing agents such as glutathione, ouabain or dithiothreitol (DTT) which cleave disulphide bonds, separating the polypeptide chains. The two polypeptide chains could be purified by high performance liquid chromatography of DTT treated HF. The individual chains had no helper activity, {{but it could be}} restored by mixing the two. One chain of the HF bonded to the DV-antigen coupled immunosorbent column and the other to the anti-I-Ak <b>antibody</b> coupled <b>column.</b> Thus, DV-induced HF is a disulphide bonded double chain structure, one chain having antigen and the other having I-A determinants; the presence of both chains is essential for helper activity...|$|R
