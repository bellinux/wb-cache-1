Despite the large literature concerning peptides derived from <b>animal</b> <b>proteins,</b> <b>only</b> recently {{the scientific community}} investigated the possibility to obtain bioactive peptides from vegetable sources, also discovering novel functional features. In this article, the functional effects of vegetable-derived peptides, including antihypertensive, antioxidant, antitumoral, antiproliferative, hypocholesterolemic, antinflammatory activities, are described.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay for {{the detection}} of mustard protein was developed. The assay is based on a polyclonal antiserum directed against a mixture of mustard proteins raised in rabbits. The assay has a detection limit of 1. 5 ppm (milligrams per kilogram) and is suitable {{for the detection of}} traces of mustard protein in mustard seed-derived flavoring ingredients. Limited cross-reactivity testing showed that no other plant proteins reacted significantly. From the <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> tested, <b>only</b> milk showed some cross-reactivity. With this sensitive assay, it was shown that refined mustard seed oil produced by steam distillation does not contain detectable amounts of mustard protein. Mustard seed oil is used as a flavoring in very low quantities, typically between 40 and 200 mg/kg. Thus, 100 g of a food product flavored with 200 mg of mustard seed oil per kg containing < 1. 5 mg of protein per kg would represent an amount of mustard seed protein of < 30 ng. Taking into account the published literature on allergic reactions to the unintended ingestion of mustard, this conservatively low calculated level indicates that it is unlikely that food products containing mustard seed oil as a flavoring ingredient will elicit an allergic reaction in mustard-allergic individuals.

40|$|Fish {{is vital}} to the {{well-being}} and livelihoods to millions of people in the Lower Mekong Basin, many of whom are poor, relying on fish as a major source of <b>animal</b> <b>protein,</b> sometimes the <b>only</b> source.

This study was initiated to explore in more detail future fish supply scenarios, the role of aquaculture, and provide a basis for understanding future investment and strategies for its sustainable development.

40|$|A {{method of}} solubilizing and extracting {{proteins}} from by-products was tested. The raw materials used were finely homogenized and digested at 60 (DEGREES) C and pH 10. 5 for 30 to 120 {{minutes in the}} presence of 0. 5 % alkaline nonspecific bacterial proteases from Bacillus subtillis. The protein in solution was separated from nonsoluble and organic solvent soluble components by filtration or centrifugation. When desired, the proteinaceous solution was dried (preferably by spray drying). Raw materials that were test digested included keratin from turkey feathers, bovine skin collagen, shark waste, shrimp heads, whole squid, inedible chicken carcass, bovine blood plasma, slaughterhouse waste, cotton gin waste, Enteromorpha sp. (a marine alga), Batis sp. and Distycilus sp. (two halophytes), soybean meal, casein, and fibrinogen. With this method, plant proteins were 57. 4 % to 59. 9 % extractable and <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> were 75. 8 % to 93. 0 % extractable. The native protein hydrolyzed by the procedure was reduced to an average molecular weight of 10, 000 - 15, 000 daltons. Other changes characteristic of the digestion process were increased protein concentration and decreased ash concentration. Complementation of by-product proteins in Tetrahymena medium resulted in increased growth compared to Tetrahymena cultures using soy or casein as the sole protein source up to 1. 25 times. Decreasing protein molecular weight resulted in decreased growth in Tetrahymena (up to 4 times). Shrimp fed hydrolyzed <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> grew <b>only</b> 37. 6 % to 54. 8 % as much as squid-fed shrimp controls. White leghorn chicks fed 40 % protein as hydrolyzed by-product proteins grew as much as chicks fed a commercial-type milo-soy diet supplemented with methionine.

If we {{accept the fact that}} the concentra-tion of amino acids in the metabolic pooi fluctuates according to the protein feeding schedule, several questions arise, all of them being of primary importance. For practical reasons, the most interesting questions for us are: How much nitrogen can be retained when <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> are given <b>only</b> in two meals? How does this retention compare with the one obtained when <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> are distributed throughout the day (four meals) ? In Chile, {{a large proportion of the}} school-children are included in the breakfast and lunch programs of the Junta Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas, an agency in charge of assistance to students with the aim of providing equal opportunities for educa-tion (2) and specifically directed toward those children belonging to the poorest fam-ilies. The feeding program takes place the half day during which every boy and girl is in school. They receive breakfast and lunch, or lunch and a snack, and through these two meals they receive approximately 34 g protein of acceptable quality (3). We know from previous dietary surveys (4, 5) that at home these children receive a diet composed almost exclusively of carbohy-drates, principally wheat products, sugar, and potatoes. Our hypothesis is that some of the pro-tein supplied by the program was being used for energy purposes; however, we could not determine how much protein was being used in this way.

One hundred and thirty five fish (average weight 70. 90 ± 5. 10 g ±SD) were randomly distributed into three treatments in triplicate. Fish were fed with either of three isonitrogenous (35 % crude protein) and isocaloric (16. 70 MJ/kg DE) experimental diets. The diets were: fish meal (FM) based diet, fish meal protein replaced with a combination of vegetal <b>protein</b> and rendered <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> (AP), and fish meal replaced with vegetal <b>protein</b> <b>only</b> (SM). Weight gain (%), specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, and apparent net protein utilization of FM diet fed groups were similar (P> 0. 05) with AP diet fed group being significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than the SM group. Feed conversion ratio with FM diet was similar (P < 0. 05) to that of the AP diet, and significantly lower than SM diet.
