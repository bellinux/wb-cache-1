5|$|In November 1955, {{while on}} the sick list for the 49ers due to a {{shoulder}} injury, Johnson carried two women to safety out of a blazing apartment building in Oakland, California. One of the women was his pregnant wife, Barbara Johnson. The couple divorced in 1959, and a bench warrant was issued for Johnson after he fell $2,360 behind on <b>alimony</b> payments, concurrent with his suspension from the Lions for missing the team plane. After retiring as a player, he worked for Columbia Gas and later for Warner Communications. He had aspirations of coaching football, but the opportunity never arose.|$|E
5|$|Philipp's mother, {{who never}} married, was the eighth child of {{relatively}} poor parents. Her father {{made a living}} as a driver and as a laborer in the construction business. The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to survive. To support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly <b>alimony</b> of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially he had to be reminded by his mother of his obligations. Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917, taking the name Johannes Fritz, and was confirmed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|At school, Brinkley was {{introduced}} to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system. He determined that this new field would help move his career forward. After two years of studies, and ever-deeper debts, Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union, but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone. Sally filed for divorce and child support, but after two months of payments, Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada. Sally Brinkley, unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada, dismissed her suit for <b>alimony</b> and child support, allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child. The couple reunited in their rocky marriage.|$|E

50|$|Douglas, meanwhile, {{has to do}} his job {{in order}} to pay two {{different}} <b>alimonies,</b> and tries to keep secret from his third wife Helena that he is not a captain. It is later revealed that Helena is having an affair. Douglas is also a recovering alcoholic, having been sober for a period of several years at the time the story begins, although he tries to prevent anyone else from knowing about it, fearing it will tarnish his image.|$|R
25|$|Verhofstadt {{was awarded}} the Vision for Europe Award in 2002 for his work toward a more unified Europe. The {{economic}} situation gave him leeway to raise the lowest social <b>alimonies</b> and lowering taxation. After 2001, the economic situation worsened. The 'Aging Fund' or 'Silver Fund' was set up, {{in order to ensure}} the maintenance of pensions until 2030. But despite his efforts to boost the economy while attempting to maintain the social benefits system, unemployment rose, after previously falling during the second Dehaene cabinet.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, after {{returning}} from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed {{to her in a}} letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of <b>alimony.</b> Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.|$|E
5|$|Münchhausen's wife Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790. In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine von Brunn, fifty-seven {{years his}} junior. Von Brunn {{reportedly}} took ill {{soon after the}} marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the spa town of Bad Pyrmont, although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time dancing and flirting. Von Brunn {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official complaint that the child was not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and <b>alimony</b> litigation. Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} home in Nova Scotia; a suburb of Toronto, Ontario; and a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. Her mother managed stores in the wedding {{industry}} and her father was a police officer with a vice squad, arresting drug dealers and pimps. While she was growing up, Falle had multiple family members with addictions. When she was a young teenager, Falle's parents divorced, and she subsequently lived in a single-parent home with her mother. They moved into an apartment in downtown Toronto. Falle's father did not pay her mother <b>alimony</b> and there was often no money for food, so Falle began stealing food to survive.|$|E

60|$|Lady Harman {{had taken}} that grubby but {{convenient}} little instrument and hidden {{it in her}} muff, and she had gone straight out of Miss <b>Alimony's</b> flat to the Post Office {{at the corner of}} Jago Street, and there, with one simple effective impact, had smashed a ground-glass window, the property of His Majesty King George the Fifth. And having done so, she had called the attention of a youthful policeman, fresh from Yorkshire, to her offence, and after a slight struggle with his incredulity and a visit to the window in question, had escorted him to the South Hampsmith police-station, and had there made him charge her. And on the way she explained to him with a newfound lucidity why it was that women should have votes.|$|R
5000|$|The Lee-Chang scandal (이철희 장영자 어음 사기 사건, Yi Chol-hui - Jang Yeong-ja eoeumsagi sageon, [...] "Yi Chol-hui - Jang Yeong-ja note fraud incident") was {{a serious}} South Korean {{financial}} scandal that unfolded in 1982 under the presidency of Chun Doo-hwan. Jang Yeong-ja was a curb market operator who provided industrial firms with loans, demanding notes worth many times the loan's value in return, on condition that the notes would not be resold. In this way, beginning with $7 million saved from the <b>alimonies</b> of her two former husbands, Jang came to personally manipulate almost $1 billion through her underground loan network, or 17% of the entire South Korean money supply. The network was uncovered {{when one of the}} firms, whose notes Jang had resold at a discount, complained to the authorities.|$|R
5|$|In 1646–47, Ashmole {{made several}} {{simultaneous}} approaches to rich widows {{in the hope}} of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and <b>alimony</b> but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay <b>alimony</b> once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive <b>alimony</b> from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E
50|$|His Polish wife is {{reported}} in the Daily Mail as saying {{that he began to}} act in a 'really silly and crazy way' when he finally settled in Poland; although they had a second child, a daughter, the marriage broke down and he became homeless. In 2006, by which time his former wife had remarried and had another baby with her new husband, Shaikh's ex-wife reported him to Polish police for using threatening behaviour against her and her children; she later withdrew her statement, and the case never went to court. In 2006 he was sentenced by a Polish court to one year in jail (suspended for four years) for driving under the influence of alcohol, and prohibited from driving for three years. He was wanted in 2007 by a Lublin court for not paying <b>alimonies.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{study in}} case makes {{part of the}} similar efforts at {{national}} and international level concerning health state and its determinants. Since it is a social desirable phenomenon, a person`s health state is a susceptible element of developing life standard and productivity or not, of prolonging active life and implicitly reducing public expenses for holidays, sick-ness <b>alimonies</b> or any other forms of social support. The starting point of our study has regarded the question at what degree health state is a determinant and a predictor of personal life quality or, opposite, a determinant of the last one. The study focuses on the identification and explanation of certain behavioural models, the life styles present in a specific geographical area, in our case-the superior basin of Moldavian Bistrita. All these are meant to explain the disparities and/or the mutual elements existent in the urban and rural environments of this study area, and the possible “endemisms” present in this area...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} individualisation theory as a parsimonious {{framework}} concept {{to describe and}} explain core points of fertility change in Western societies {{since the end of}} the 19 th century. We emphasise two dimensions of individualisation: firstly, the increase in status of the individual in cultural, social, economic and legal respects (human dignity); secondly, the increase in autonomy and freedom of choice. In contrast to other approaches based on individualisation theory, we do not use the concept of self-realisation in the sense of an increased orientation towards purely individual interests, not least because this concept has failed before the renewed rise in fertility that has recently been observed in some advanced societies. Whereas the first demographic transition can be mainly explained by the rising status of children, which increased the costs of parenting and thus changed the interests of (potential) parents to have children, the transition in the 1960 s resulted mainly from the rising status of women in education and the labour market. An important but hitherto neglected change was the increasing divorce rates, as the possibility to dissolve a marriage devalued the traditional gender contract of the breadwinner/housewife model and decreased the willingness of women and men to invest in marriage and children. The contrast between the recently growing fertility rates in Sweden, France and the US with the continuously low fertility in the German-speaking countries can partly be seen as a result of different divorce regimes. Whereas the first group of countries has limited the entitlements to child and spousal support through <b>alimonies,</b> the second group has institutionalised extensive entitlements for mother and child...|$|R

6000|$|Marjorie {{considered}} the Movements about her. She surveyed the accessible aspects of socialism, but that old treasure-house of constructive suggestion {{had an effect}} like a rich château which had been stormed and looted by a mob. For a time the proposition that [...] "we are all Socialists nowadays" [...] had prevailed. The blackened and discredited frame remained, the contents were scattered; Aunt Plessington had a few pieces, the Tory Democrats had taken freely, the Liberals were {{in possession of a}} hastily compiled collection. There wasn't, she perceived, and there never had been a Socialist Movement; the socialist idea which had now become part of the general consciousness, had always been too big for polite domestication. She weighed Aunt Plessington, too, in the balance, and found her not so much wanting indeed as excessive. She felt that a Movement with Aunt Plessington in it couldn't possibly offer even elbow-room for anybody else. Philanthropy generally she shunned. The movements that aim at getting poor people into rooms and shouting at them in an improving, authoritative way, aroused an instinctive dislike in her. Her sense of humour, again, would not let her patronize Shakespear or the stage, or raise the artistic level of the country by means of green-dyed deal, and the influence of Trafford on her mind debarred her from attempting the physical and moral regeneration of humanity by means of beans and nut butter. It was indeed rather by the elimination of competing movements than by any positive preference that she found herself declining at last towards Agatha <b>Alimony's</b> section of the suffrage movement.... It was one of the less militant sections, but it held more meetings and passed more resolutions than any two others.|$|R
