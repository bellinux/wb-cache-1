25|$|FIFA {{reviewed}} {{the possibility of}} increasing Suárez's ban but decided against punishing him for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether players in that situation should be condemned as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players {{would do the same}} thing in the 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat. Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The Council was the brain-child of Lord Harris. In November 1886 he {{had sent}} a letter to the County Secretaries <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> as to whether the {{existing}} two year qualification rule should be reduced to one year. Under this rule players who changed counties generally had to serve a two year residence qualification in their new county during which they were unable to play inter-county matches for either county. The proposal was defeated at the annual Secretary's meeting in December 1886, but at the same meeting it was agreed that a committee be set up to consider the rules of county cricket generally. At a meeting in July 1887, at which the report of the committee was considered, it was agreed that a County Cricket Council be formed. It was further agreed that the existing committee frame the by-laws of the new Council.|$|E

Hawley was specifically interested in exploring the character of David Haller because of his mental illness, and for the potential of the series to depict his unique mindset.

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, all lessons at the college were cancelled {{for the remainder of the}} week, and classes were relocated to a temporary facility the following Monday. The town's other schools remained open. A candlelight vigil was held near the school grounds on the day after the shooting, and Kauhajoki Church held a memorial service on the evening of September 23. A second memorial service, on September 28, the Sunday following the shootings, was held, with the President and students attending. Three members of the congregation lit a further eleven candles (one for each killed, including Saari) at the service. Leading the service was Bishop Simo Peura, who reflected on Finland's treatment of young people, <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "What kind of society are we building?".|$|E

Before the sequence of the eviction of the mistress occurs in Act I of the musical, Eva's character sings the song [...] "Hello and goodbye" [...] and then [...] "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] begins. A soft strummed guitar in broken chord patterns heralds the introductory music. Dickson sings the opening verse, and the chorus which is repeated twice as she asks, [...] "So, what happens now?" [...] and wonders about her immediate future, ultimately concluding that she would survive. For the second verse, the lyrics reflect on this recurring pattern of being evicted out of men's lives, and the final verses have a more positive outlook toward's the subject's life. The song finishes with the mistress <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Where am I going to?" [...] as a male voice pacifies by saying, [...] "Don't ask, anymore".

500|$|The episode premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. Although initially cringing {{over the}} musical premise, Ramsey Isler of IGN called the episode [...] "admittedly fun" [...] because it [...] "gave us an indirect window to view how Walter feels about himself". In {{a review of}} the DVD, another critic from IGN later called it the [...] "worst overall episode" [...] of the season however, <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> [...] "Musical numbers and Olivia Dunham: who thought {{this would be a good}} idea?" [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was also initially irritated after hearing Fox's musical plans, and consequently gave [...] "Fringe a lot of credit for pulling off this hour so cleverly" [...] Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic thought the episode was [...] "bizarre" [...] to watch; it [...] "held our interest for the entire 60 minutes, but really failed to introduce any new information about Peter and the unknown man that has crossed into our dimension". MTVs John Wigler loved the [...] "noir" [...] element, and thought [...] "each and every participating [...] "Fringe" [...] cast member exhibited great musical ability. Overall, it was a very solid effort on everyone's part". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad loved the scenes between Walter and Ella, and thought [...] "it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story". While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: [...] "All in all, what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality – one of the turning points in the show’s mythology – fell flat". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing [...] "There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode [...] "edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well".|$|E
