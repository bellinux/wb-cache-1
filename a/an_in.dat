5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: <b>an</b> <b>in</b> rem suit against the ship, and <b>an</b> <b>in</b> personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends <b>an</b> <b>IN</b> packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E

5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession.

A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E
