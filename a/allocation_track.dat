We apply micro-data from the Netherlands about cognitive test scores and teacher assessment in elementary schools and about track placement, track switching and test scores in secondary schools. Our estimates suggest that subjective teacher assessment is about twice as important as the elementary school cognitive test scores for initial track placement in secondary school. In addition, teacher assessment is more predictive of track allocation in 9 th grade compared to cognitive test scores. Next, children who switch tracks are more likely to be placed in tracks based on test scores. Also, test scores in 9 th grade are predicted by subjective teacher assessment, not by test scores in 6 th grade. Finally, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that switching could be reduced by at least ten percent if children would have been allocated according to the teacher's assessment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Large {{applications}} often {{suffer from}} excessive memory consumption. The {{nature of these}} heaps, their scale and complex interconnections, {{makes it difficult to}} find the low hanging fruit. Techniques relying on dominance or <b>allocation</b> <b>tracking</b> fail to account for sharing, and overwhelm users with small details. More fundamentally, a programmer still needs to know whether high levels of consumption are too high. We present a solution that discovers a small set of high-impact memory problems, by detecting patterns within a heap. Patterns are expressed over a novel ContainerOrContained relation, which overcomes challenges of reuse, delegation, sharing; it induces equivalence classes of objects, based on how they participate in a hierarchy of data structures. We present results on 34 applications, and case studies for nine of these. We demonstrate that eleven patterns cover most memory problems, and that users need inspect {{only a small number of}} pattern occurrences to reap large benefits...|$|R

Selleks, et mõõta mälueraldamiste jälgijate effektivsus kasutasime SPECjvm 2008 jõudlustestide komplekt. Mälu kasutamise mõõtmiseks oli kirjatud oma JVM TI agent, mis perioodiliselt kirjutab kasutatud mälu suurus CSV faili. Töö käigus olid läbi vaadatud ja testitud selliseid mälueraldamiste jälgimise lahendusi: •	HRPOF – lihtne käsurea kasutajaliidesega profileerimise tööriist, mis pakutakse JavaDevelopment Kit (JDK) koosseisus. •	NetBeans profileerija – varem see oli eraldiseisav avatud lähtekoodiga uurimis proekt nimega JFluid. Praegu see on NetBeansi osa. •	TPTP profileerija – profileerija, mis kasutatakse Eclipse IDE’s. •	Project Allocation Instrumenter – mälu eraldamiste jälgija Google’st. On kirjutatud puhtas Javas.

Eclipse TPTP profileerija ei suutnud edukalt oma tööd lõpetada mitmel korral erinevate jõudlustestide käivitamise ajal. NetBeans profileerija on tehniliselt kõige arenenum ja kõike tõhusam mäluerdlamiste jälgimise lahendus. See ei ole üllatav, kuna Sun’i insenerid kirjutasid seda parrallelselt Java virtualse masina arenguga. Kõige problemaatilisem mälueraldamiste jälgimise mõttes oli sunflow jõudlustest. Koos TPTP profileerijaga ta jooksis umbes 300 korda aeglasemalt. HPROF’i ja Allocation Instrumenter’i tulemused ei olnud määrkimväärselt paremad. Ainult NetBeans profileerija said enam-vähem efektiivselt töötada sellel testil. Kõik läbi vaadatud lahendused, välja arvatud TPTP, kasutavad mälueraldamiste jälgmiseks baitkoodi manipuleerimist (ByteCode Instrumentation, BCI). Nad lisavad oma jälgimise meetodi väljakutse pärast iga objekti loomise baitkoodi (opcode new). TPTP oma tööks kasutab JVM TI sündmuseid. Erilist huvi pakkub Allocation Instrumenter Google’st. See raamistik võimaldab kirjutada mälueraldamiste jälgijat puhtas Java keeles. Potensiaalselt see teeb lahendus platvorimst sõltumatuks. Kuid veel eksisteerivad lahendamata probleeme jõudlusega. Minu tulevikuplaanis on aru saada, kas saab teha mälueraldamiste jälgimist. Memory leaks in Java are not {{the same}} as memory leaks in, for example, the C programming language. When a C-programmer wants to use memory on the heap, he should manually allocate a memory region. After application finishes using this memory, it should be manually freed. If the pointer to the allocated region is lost, then there is no appropriate way to release this memory. This situation is called a “memory leak”. In Java the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles all work with memory. When a developer wants to create and use a new object, the JVM allocates a necessary amount of memory. During an application’s life the JVM periodically checks for objects in memory that are not used anymore. Objects, which are not referenced, will be discarded and memory reclaimed to be used again. This process is called garbage collection. A memory leak in Java is a situation, where an application is not logically using objects, to which references still exist, meaning the Garbage Collector (GC) can’t mark them as unused and free memory. When memory management of JVM cannot allocate any more memory, java. lang. OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. When a developer is faced with an “OutOfMemoryError” on production server, he can try to reproduce the problem in a test environment. Unfortunately, oftentimes test environments do not allow for reproduction of such errors. It’s not always possible to mimic all parameters of a real environment. Developer often doesn’t have all required input data or he just does not know how and why the memory leak occurred. This can be also caused by all sorts of bureaucratic obstacles and barriers in large companies with separate operations and development departments and developers just do not have full access to machines in a real environment. However, even if it is possible to search for memory leaks in a production environment – use of many developer’s tools, such as full-featured profilers is not possible, due to the memory and performance overhead not suitable for production environment. It is useful to apply all possible offline methods, such as analysis of heap dumps and collection of allocations’ logs. And when a memory leak is localized, only then it would be helpful to turn on an allocation tracker for a specific set of objects or allocation sites to find out what code is responsible for creating objects that are eventually leaked. In order to do it in a production environment, we need effective methods and algorithms for <b>allocation</b> <b>tracking.</b> Memory <b>allocations</b> tracker is a tool, which works in runtime and logs memory allocation by specific objects or sites. Usually it is a part of a profiler, but standalone solutions also exist. The aim of this work is to review and compare existing open source solutions for <b>allocation</b> <b>tracking</b> in JVM. The first chapter of this work describes benchmarking techniques, which will be used for comparison of different allocations trackers. In this work will SPECjvm 2008 will be used. It is a benchmark suite for measuring the performance of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It contains several real life applications and benchmarks focusing on core java functionality. The SPECjvm 2008 workload mimics a variety of common general-purpose application computations. As SPECjvm 2008 does not give any information about memory usage a lightweight JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent was created. JVM TI allows a program to inspect the state and to control the execution of other application running in the JVM [1]. The agent works in a separate thread and writes memory usage statistics to a CSV file every second. The agent creates an insignificant overhead, so it does not distort the SPECjvm 2008 results. In the next chapters of this work open-source allocations trackers are reviewed. Their work principles, algorithms and memory structures are examined. For measuring <b>allocations</b> <b>tracking</b> efficiency the SPECjvm 2008 suite will be run with every tested <b>allocations</b> <b>tracking</b> solution. The obtained data allows comparing memory and performance overhead of different approaches in memory <b>allocations</b> <b>tracking.</b> Chapter 2 introduces HPROF – an example profiler, shipped with the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) and uses the JVM TI. In chapter 3 we review the NetBeans profiler, previously known as JFluid. This is full-weight Java profiler integrated with the NetBeans IDE. Chapter 4 is about Eclipse Test and Performance platform. This is a collection of open- source frameworks and services that allows software developers to build test and performance tools.

40|$|Transatlantic flight {{operations}} are, {{due to the}} absence of radar-based surveillance, the influence of the polar jet stream and the highly directional traffic peaks, significantly different compared to continental {{flight operations}}. To safely accommodate all transatlantic traffic in the North Atlantic oceanic airspace the Organized Track System (OTS) has been established, existing of a number of pre-determined flight routes. Currently, about half of all transatlantic traffic uses the OTS which is created twice a day, once to accommodate the westbound traffic and once to accommodate the eastbound traffic flow. All aircraft requesting to use the OTS send an oceanic clearance request to the oceanic planning controller, containing the estimated time of arrival at the track entry boundary, the preferred OTS track, flight level and Mach number. The aircraft are cleared onto the OTS using a first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach, taking the separation requirements with already cleared aircraft into account. If an oceanic clearance request cannot be granted due to a potential loss of separation, the requesting aircraft will receive an alternative clearance. The research objectives of this thesis assignment are to: “Reduce the total direct operating cost of transatlantic air traffic by optimizing the OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure using a real-time meta-heuristic scheduling algorithm” “Create a model capable of optimizing the OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure for different cost-index values” This research aims at improving the current OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure by changing the first-come, first-served approach, currently used, to a scheduling concept in which the total direct operating cost (DOC) is minimized for a large number of aircraft in a single optimization window. The use of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis project and the potential of using stochastic optimization for large scheduling problems is researched. The direct operating cost penalties for the possible alternative clearances is determined using fuel consumption models in combination with time cost models. The created population algorithm is tested for multiple cost-index values, using real life problems, and the results are compared to the existing OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure. The generated results show a potential direct operating cost reduction as well as the possibility to use the created <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm as a real-time decision support tool for the oceanic planning controller.

All surgical specimens for EORLA are processed in one central location, the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (DPLM) at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH), where the rapid growth and influx of surgical and cytology specimens has created many challenges in ensuring the timely processing of cases and reports. Although the entire process is maintained and tracked in a clinical information system, this system lacks pre-emptive warnings that can help management address issues as they arise. Aims: Dashboard technology provides automated, real-time visual clues {{that could be used}} to alert management when a case or specimen is not being processed within predefined time frames. We describe the development of a dashboard helping pathology clinical management to make informed decisions on specimen <b>allocation</b> and <b>tracking.</b> Methods: The dashboard was designed and developed in two phases, following a prototyping approach. The first prototype of the dashboard helped monitor and manage pathology processes at the DPLM. Results: The use of this dashboard helped to uncover operational inefficiencies and contributed to an improvement of turn-around time within The Ottawa Hospital′s DPML. It also allowed the discovery of additional requirements, leading to a second prototype that provides finer-grained, real-time information about individual cases and specimens.

This has often been attributed to the early ability-based between-school tracking in the German school system. However, as yet there has been no empirical evaluation of the actual impact of initial track placement on social inequality in final school attainment. Since educational reforms in the 1960 s increased educational mobility after track placement, it can be expected that initial <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> has become less important for the process of secondary educational attainment and the inequalities therein. By drawing on longitudinal life-course data for different birth cohorts from the 1930 s to the 1980 s, this paper analyses temporal developments in the connections between track placement, educational mobility and social inequality in final school outcomes. The analyses reveal that the impact of track placement actually diminished for those cohorts exposed to the reformed school system. Instead, social inequalities in school attainment are increasingly influenced by processes of educational mobility after <b>track</b> <b>allocation.</b> Furthermore, the analyses show that developments in educational mobility have contributed more to declining inequalities in access to upper secondary education than changes of the selectivities in the transition to secondary education...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses multi-carrier, multi-line train scheduling {{problems for}} forward and spot markets. Schedules resulting from solution of these train scheduling problems enable carriers to make customer commitments for serving forward contracts and to transport one-off-loads arising on spot markets. A train slot selection model based on multicommodity network flow concepts is developed for determining timetables {{for use in}} forward markets and a column generation methodology is proposed for its solution. The model considers needs of both shippers and carriers. The solution approach is embedded in a simulation-based iterative framework, where demand elasticity is explicitly treated. A combinatorial auction-based <b>track</b> capacity <b>allocation</b> framework is introduced to allocate residual track capacity among competing carriers seeking to run additional trains on an as-needed basis. Bid set construction techniques are proposed that allow carriers to express their preferences for track usage. A winner determination problem is formulated, solution of which provides the optimal <b>allocation</b> of <b>track</b> capacity among carriers. The potential benefits of collaborative operation among carriers in both markets were recognized. Collaborative decision-making (CDM) strategies are designed for scheduling trains to serve forward markets. Performances of these strategies are assessed in a carrier collaboration simulation-assignment framework. A train space leasing technique and a CA-based train slot creation approach are proposed to accommodate one-off-loads on previously scheduled and newly formed trains, respectively. Required techniques for bid set construction are developed. A WDP is formulated that seeks the optimal <b>allocation</b> of <b>track</b> access rights to bidders for the given bid sets. Implementation of the resulting train schedules will aid in creating efficient and cost-effective rail transport, resulting in a competitive and green alternative to truck transportation. Additionally, collaboration among competing carriers {{can lead to the}} formation of profitable trains that might otherwise have been underutilized and an ability of each carrier to serve a greater share of the freight market. The methodologies were specifically intended for solving large, real-world train scheduling problems...|$|R
