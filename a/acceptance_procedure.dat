5000|$|The {{community}} has made tough decisions {{in order to}} survive. Until 2012, {{the ideology of the}} community had been Judeo-Christian dialogue in unconditional solidarity with Israel, right or wrong. This dialogue left no room for indigenous Christian Arabs, not to mention for Muslims. In 2012, the community decided to adopt a more inclusive inter-faith [...] "dimension", and to transform its facilities into meeting place for Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel. The residential buildings are now rented out to Jewish Israelis, and attempts are made to find some Arab Israelis as well. This may not be an easy task, however, as the organization is still deeply steeped in its old tradition of unconditional support for a Jewish State of Israel: an April 2015 article in Haaretz by acclaimed journalist Amira Hass describes the <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure</b> as one in which Arabs can only be admitted if they check their identity at the door, for instance by joining in the celebration of Jewish-Israeli patriotic holidays. Applicants are vetted by a committee consisting of four Jewish Israelis and two Dutchmen. Since Nes Ammim is owned by a private corporation, it claims exemption from the Israeli law that requires that decisions by vetting committees must be transparent and cannot be discriminatory, a law upheld in the famous Ka'adan case.|$|E

End-result specifications are suited to Oregon’s needs at present; however, performance-related specifications currently {{do not appear to be}} suited to Oregon needs. Many agencies are increasing the use of mix volumetrics in specifications, in part because the use of Superpave mixes is increasing and these mixes are designed using mix volumetrics. Recommended specifications for Superpave and stone-matrix asphalt mixes are available and have been implemented by some states. Pay factor equations have been formulated that allow separation of the parameter mean and standard deviation, thus encouraging the contractor to hit the job mix formula target and minimize the process variability...|$|R

5000|$|After {{failing to}} achieve {{victory in the}} {{election}} process of the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the city council of Madrid decided to nominate it a candidate to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on July 3, 2006. The nomination was encouraged by statements {{of the president of}} the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Jacques Rogge, that European cities would still have a chance to host the 2016 Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched the bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. On May 30, 2007, the candidature was formalized by the Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC) with claims to be [...] "radically new" [...] and more prepared than the city's last attempt to host the Olympics. The IOC announced that seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo—were submitted by their respective NOCs to bid for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Madrid bid committee attended the 2016 Applicant Cities' Seminar in Lausanne, Switzerland, on October 18, 2007, where it learnt more about the bidding process. The Application Files, which contain the answers and guarantees requested by the IOC's 2016 Candidature <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Procedure</b> and Questionnaire, were returned by all seven applicant cities to the IOC on January 14, 2008. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group and the IOC Executive Board, at the latter meeting to decide which cities would be accepted as candidate cities.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{increased}} use, also in training exercises, the Char D2s were largely worn {{out at this}} moment. The battalion eagerly awaited the replacement of their, at that time 44, old vehicles by the second production series. The decision in March to upgrade the existing tanks came as a severe disappointment. It implied {{that the number of}} operational vehicles would at first decline even further as they gradually were removed from the battalion strength to be rebuilt. On 26 April the situation deteriorated even further when the order came to split off one of the companies. It would on 7 May be turned into an autonomous tank company, the 345e CACC (Compagnie Autonome de Chars de Combat) under command of Captain Jean-Charles Idée, {{to be part of the}} CEFS (Corps Expeditionnaire Français de Scandinavie), the French Expeditionary Corps of Scandinavia, that had been built up during the winter to assist Finland against the USSR in the Winter War. It was now, Finland already having been defeated, redirected to assist Norway against the German invasion during Operation Weserübung. By drawing lots it was decided that the First Company (1/19 BCC) would be sent. The company would be equipped with fourteen tanks of the second production series, leaving its old tanks behind. This seemed to imply that the new vehicles would never be destined for 19e BCC, not even in a later phase. On 29 April the company received its replacement tanks, but these transpired to be, though brandnew, in a very poor mechanical condition and broke down almost immediately. The causes were never investigated; conforming to the pervading Fifth Column atmosphere of the day, the malfunctioning was not attributed to the structurally deficient quality control at Renault combined with a hasty <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure,</b> but to sabotage. Soon however, the plan to send the company to Norway was cancelled as the reports of the previous winter clearly showed that the Char D2 was unsuited to snow conditions.|$|E

40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} procedures {{are widely used}} in industry {{as part of the}} total quality control activities. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure</b> is usually constructed based on a set of statistical and/or economic requirements specified by the producer and/or the consumer. After the <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure</b> is determined, the users are interested in evaluating its statistical and economic characteristics. This dissertation presents a comprehensive approach for constructing and evaluating acceptance {{sampling procedures}}. A large variety of statistical and economic characteristics is studied, from both the producer's and consumer's viewpoints. A part of the <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure</b> is the sampling plan. Various statistical characteristics of the sampling plan are studied. The statistical evaluation of the <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure</b> consists of analyzing these characteristics. The economic analysis includes identification of the possible actions during the <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedure</b> and evaluation of the producer's profit and the consumer's cost functions associated with each action. Guidelines for applying the statistical and economic characteristics in the evaluation process are presented. In a real situation, sampling may be subjected to inspection errors, which can affect the statistical and economic characteristics of the acceptance procedure; so all the characteristics were restudied for an error-prone sampling inspection. The statistical and economic characteristics are used to specify sets of requirements for constructing acceptance procedures. Selection of an appropriate set is based on the needs of the user, the available data, and the conditions under which the procedure is to be applied. The concluding step is to combine the construction and evaluation methods into an overall analysis cycle of "construct-evaluate-reconstruct. " Computer programs are given to facilitate application of the evaluation and construction processes. This study deals explicitly with single sampling plans for attributes. The analysis is based on the Bayesian approach in which the prior distribution is a mixed binomial with a beta weight function. However, the presented approach can be applied to any type of sampling and prior distribution. The results of the study can be used by decision makers as a tool to improve the use of acceptance procedures in a large variety of scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this project is to devise {{improved}} quality <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> to examine quality characteristics of utility poles at the factory of the supplier (FAT) and on-site upon receipt by the customer (SAT). To that end, the thesis draws upon available standards, literature, and industry practices regarding wood, fiberglass and steel poles. As far as {{the design of the}} research, a single case study of a major power company was chosen. Then, a data collection plan was developed in order to build upon the existing knowledge found in the literature, and upon the data that can be collected from three of the Company’s suppliers, in addition to the Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP). Documents’ analysis, interviews, observations, and a survey were the tools of that plan. It was found that criteria, inspection and test methods of wood poles are all sufficiently covered in the standards and the literature; for wood is the most commonly used material for utility poles. Next, in coverage of research, are the steel poles; while there is currently no standard that covers fiberglass utility poles. Indeed, quality characteristics, criteria, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> can altogether form parts of a sustainable solution, as long as the quality is managed as a process whether at the Company’s end or at the fabrication sites; that is especially true if there is some form of backward partnership between the Company and its suppliers...|$|R
