The importance of this principle also takes a great place in field of company law, especially in the area of “freedom of establishment of the companies” in the European Single Market (hereinafter ESM). Freedom of establishment of companies is closely related to the general concept of “free movement of people, capital, goods and services,” in ESM. In fact, freedom of establishment is a substantive {{part of the process of}} creation the internal market in EU. The freedom of establishment is based on the Treaty of the functioning of EU (hereinafter TFEU). According to article 49 from TFEU (previously article 43 et seq. EC Treaty), restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be prohibited. This prohibition also applies to restrictions on setting-up of <b>agencies,</b> <b>branches</b> <b>or</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of any Member State.

Freedom of establishment of companies is closely related to the principles of healthy and fair competition and equal access of the companies too. This article seeks to elaborate fundamental theoretical aspects of this issue, considering certain case - study analyze of CJEU judgements.

40|$|We analyse a {{model in}} which bank {{deposits}} are insured {{and there is an}} exoge-nous cost of bank capital.

Regulatory capital requirements introduce investment distortions which are a constrained optimal response to these mar-ket imperfections.

The extent of underinvestment depends upon the home bank’s riskiness, the extent of international diversification, and the liability structure (<b>branch</b> <b>or</b> <b>subsidiary)</b> of the multinational. Capital requirements for international banks should therefore reflect these effects.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} the leverage cycle in Luxembourg?s banking sector using individual bank-level data for the period 2003 Q 1 to 2010 Q 1. We discuss the mechanics behind the leverage cycle in Luxembourg?s banks and show that these banks predominantly adjust leverage by changing both loans and deposits. One of our findings is that Luxembourg?s banks have a procyclical leverage. This procyclicality is not due to marking-to-market but because Luxembourg?s banks are liquidity providers to the EU banking sector. This also explains the different evolution of leverage compared to the US commercial banks (Adrian and Shin [1]) that, even though their balance sheet structure {{is similar to that}} of the Luxembourgish banks, target a constant leverage. To further understand what drives leverage in Luxembourg?s banks we empirically investigate the role of bank characteristics as well as real, financial and expectation variables that proxy for macroeconomic conditions in the pre-crisis and crisis period. We find that off-balance sheet exposures have different effects in the pre-crisis and crisis period, and that the share of liquid assets in the portfolio only affects the amount of security holdings. In terms of macroeconomic variables, we find that the Euribor-OIS spread is a significant driver of the build-up in leverage in the pre-crisis period. The reason is that most banks in Luxembourg are either <b>branches</b> <b>or</b> <b>subsidiaries.</b> This, firstly, makes leverage a less relevant indicator of riskiness for investors. Secondly, it implies that in times of liquidity shortages, mother companies or groups demand further liquidity from their <b>branch</b> <b>or</b> <b>subsidiary.</b> The downturn in leverage during the crisis can be accredited to reductions in expectations, which we proxy by an economic sentiment indicator. It can also be explained by increasing bond prices which induce depositors to shift their funds from bank deposits into bonds. We find no important role for GDP growth. leverage dynamics, banking sector, GMM estimation, crisis effect...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{stability}} {{remains a}} key theme globally {{in view of}} the Euro zone debt crisis. The latest strategy by Germany and France is to ring-fence the crisis among the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain). In the United Kingdom, the big four major banks have all responded to the Independent Commission of Bankings interim report key recommendation: ring-fencing retail operations into a separate subsidiary of any bank that wishes to operate in the United Kingdom. The report has clearly discussed {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various types of subsidiarisation. Retail ring-fencing is considered a compromise as full subsidiarisation is too costly and operational subsidiarisation is too minimal. The Independent Commission of Banking published its final report on 12 September 2011. They recommended ring-fencing retail banking and a 10 per cent equity baseline. This article focuses on structural reforms of UK banks. It aims to address the question of financial stability from a wider European perspective. The first question is whether cross-border retail banking in the European Economic Area (EEA) is best served by <b>branches</b> <b>or</b> <b>subsidiaries?</b> The second question concerns the legality of setting up subsidiaries in the European Union (EU). Although there are no legal problems for UK-based banks setting up subsidiaries for their retail activities, there might be a legal hurdle for requiring foreign banks setting up subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. The third question concerns EU cross-border banking regulation and supervision. Are the passporting system and the home country supervisory approach still applicable in this post-financial crisis era? Many factors influence the choice of setting up <b>branches</b> <b>or</b> <b>subsidiaries.</b> However, the general position is that branches are more suited for wholesale/investment activities because of ease of funds transfer. Subsidiaries are more suitable for retail banking because of the limited liability principle and extensive local network. Effective cross-border banking must be accompanied by effective supervision and resolution regimes. The passporting concept under EU law and home country dominance are somewhat dated post-financial crisis. Host country control should play a dominant part in financial regulation, especially in the light of the importance of subsidiaries and the limited liability principle associated with them. The Icelandic bank crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers International Europe illustrate the importance of host country control. Finally, the author argues that requiring banks to hold its retail activities in the form of subsidiaries in another European country is necessary to achieve financial stability. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R

The exact size of IUA members’ contribution to the London market is not known. They wrote a total of at least £10 billion premium during 2009, a figure that does not include income processed outside the London market bureau. This business is wholesale, the bulk being made up of insurance for large multinational companies or reinsurance. Most of it is international, brought into London by brokers.The IUA provides a forum for discussing market issues and providing technical support to practitioners. IUA members collectively own a 25% share of Xchanging Ins-sure Services (XIS), the provider of back office processing services to the London market. HistoryThe IUA was formed in January 1998 from the merger of the London International Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA) and the Institute of London Underwriters (ILU). The main stated reason for the merger was the desire to give the London company market a single voice in dealings with government, regulators and other insurance bodies. Since the ILU had been formed in 1884, the IUA can claim to go back more than a century. The association has always made reform of the London market a top priority, especially the replacement of out-of-date processes and increased use of technology to conduct business. [...] This led in 1999 {{to the creation of the}} IUA-Lloyd’s Forum. This soon expanded to include brokers and eventually evolved into the London Market Group, which is still active today.|$|R
