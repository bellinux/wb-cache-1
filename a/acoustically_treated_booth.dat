On the basis of inlet total pressure recovery loss per PNdb of noise reduction, an inlet with no splitters produced the most efficient design.

40|$|A set of long chord {{stator vanes}} was {{designed}} to replace the vanes in an existing fan stage. The long chord stator vanes consisted of a turning section and axial extension pieces, all of which incorporated acoustic damping material. The long chord stator vanes were tested in two lengths, with the long version giving more noise reduction than the short, {{primarily because of the}} additional lining material. The noise reduction achieved with the <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> long chord stator vanes was compared with the reduction achieved by an <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> exhaust splitter. The long chord stator was at least as good as the splitter as a method for incorporating acoustic lining material.

40|$|Recent {{acoustic}} {{data have}} shown larger noise attenuations than predicted for <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> aircraft engine inlets without splitter rings. These data have stimulated {{a more detailed}} theoretical study of the acoustic propagation of spinning modes in <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> open circular ducts. In addition, the suppressor with splitter rings was modeled by using the rectangular approximation to the annular duct. The theoretical models {{were used to determine}} optimum impedance and maximum attenuation for several spinning lobe numbers from 0 to 50. It is found that for circular ducts the maximum possible attenuation and the optimum wall impedance are strong functions of the lobe number. For annular ducts the attenuation and optimum wall impedance are insensitive to the spinning lobe number for well cut-on modes. The results help explain why suppressors with splitter rings have been quite effective in spite of the lack of detailed information on the noise-source modal structure. Conversely, effective use of outer-wall treatment alone will require expanded knowledge of the noise-source structure. Approximate solutions are presented to help interpret the more exact theoretical results...|$|R

The aerodynamic {{data were collected}} concurrently with acoustic measurements {{as part of a}} larger aeroacoustic study targeting airframe noise associated with main landing gear/flap components, gear-flap interaction noise, and the viability of related noise mitigation technologies. The aeroacoustic tests were conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel with the facility in the <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> open-wall (jet) mode. Most of the measurements were obtained with the model in landing configuration with the flap deflected at 39 and the main landing gear on and off. Data were acquired at Mach numbers of 0. 16, 0. 20, and 0. 24. Global forces (lift and drag) and extensive steady and unsteady surface pressure measurements were obtained. Comparison of the present results with those acquired during a previous test shows a significant reduction in the lift experienced by the model. The underlying cause was traced to the likely presence of a much thicker boundary layer on the tunnel floor, which was <b>acoustically</b> <b>treated</b> for the present test. The steady and unsteady pressure fields on the flap, particularly in the regions of predominant noise sources such as the inboard and outboard tips, remained unaffected. It is shown that the changes in lift and drag coefficients for model configurations fitted with gear/flap noise abatement technologies fall within the repeatability of the baseline configuration. Therefore, the noise abatement technologies evaluated in this experiment have no detrimental impact on the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft model...|$|R

In fact, the prediction showed good agreement with the data only for the full-ring inlet configuration.
