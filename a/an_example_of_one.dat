5|$|In the 18th century, {{coffee and}} chop houses were {{established}} on the street; Twinings was established at No.206 in 1706 by Thomas Twining, supplier of tea to Queen Anne. The company {{claims to be}} the oldest ratepayer in Westminster. The Grecian Coffee House ran from around 1702 to 1803, while Tom's ran from 1706 to around 1775. Though these premises were well-known, the alleyways around the Strand were regular haunts for pickpockets and prostitutes during this time. The Rose Tavern, at the eastern end of the street, was frequented by lawyers during the 18th century. It was later demolished and became Thanet Place. The Crown and Anchor was the main meeting place for the Catholic Association and helped established the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. It was later used for Catholic politicians such as Daniel O'Connell to address constituents. The original premises burned down in 1854, but was rebuilt. Simpson's-in-the-Strand originally started at No.100 in 1828 as a smoking and dining club. It later became a restaurant. The Strand was also notable in the 18th century as a centre for the British book trade, with numerous printers and publishers along the street. The prominent bookseller Andrew Millar is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the most successful publishers who owned a shop there.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Judeo-Christian view of Jacob, one main {{difference is that the}} story of Jacob's blessing, in which he deceives Isaac, is not accepted in Islam. The Qur'an makes it clear that Jacob was blessed by God as a prophet and, therefore, Muslims believe that his father, being a prophet as well, also knew of his son's greatness. Jacob is also cited in the Hadith as <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> who was patient and trusting in God in the face of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Animal mummification {{originated}} in ancient Egypt. They mummified various animals. It {{was an enormous}} part of Egyptian culture, not only in their role as food and pets, but also for religious reasons. They were typically mummified for four main purposes—to allow beloved pets {{to go on to}} the afterlife, to provide food in the afterlife, to act as offerings to a particular god, and because some were seen as physical manifestations of specific gods that the Egyptians worshipped. Bast, the cat goddess is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> such deity.|$|E

25|$|The Aux/IAA repressors provide <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the {{pathways}} leading to auxin induced changes of gene expression. This pathway involves the protein families TIR1 (transport inhibitor response1), ARF (auxin response factor), Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, and the ubiquitin ligase complex {{that is a}} part of the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway. ARF proteins have DNA binding domains and can bind promoter regions of genes and activate or repress gene expression. Aux/IAA proteins can bind ARF proteins sitting on gene promoters and prevent them from doing their job.|$|E
25|$|The Deux arabesques is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of his {{earliest}} works, already developing his musical language. Suite bergamasque (1890) recalls rococo decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement, and contains {{one of his}} most popular pieces, Clair de Lune. His String Quartet in G minor (1893) paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration, using the Phrygian mode as well as less standard scales such as the whole-tone, which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony. He was beginning to employ a single, continuous theme, breaking away from the traditional A–B–A form with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since Joseph Haydn.|$|E
25|$|Sega was {{supportive}} of the team's rewriting of the plot, sending over quality assurance and cohesion strike teams {{to make sure there}} were no issues with the in-game reactivity or plot holes, but they didn't have much involvement in regards to the narrative itself, with the publisher mainly focusing on the game and combat design. However, Urquhart said {{that one of the reasons}} for the game's development problems was due to indecision on Sega's part, particularly in regards to budgeting; he gave <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> long segment of the game that cost around US$500,000 to produce, which was eventually cut because Sega thought it wasn't a good fit for the game.|$|E

25|$|Sir Alan Burns, Governor of British Honduras (1934-1939), used Benque Viejo as <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> {{challenge}} that teaching in Belizean schools presents: “I have heard German nuns {{trying to teach}} Maya children out of an English textbook which they had to explain in Spanish.” The solution, in higher education at least, has been to require English in the classroom. The Garifuna have enculturated the Catholic Mass and have it in their own language. As regards the Kriol language which most speak in Belize City there has been more controversy. Several Christian churches have introduced Kriol into their services and a Kriol New Testament has been produced. But the Catholic Mass, requiring approval from Roman authorities, has not been translated into Kriol. On the other hand, Catholics are {{deeply involved in the}} Kriol Council, and St. John’s College through its Belize Institute for Social Research and Action (BISRA) publishes Belizean Studies which carries articles on the role of Kriol and other cultures in Belizean Society.|$|E
25|$|If a {{mutation}} {{is present}} in a germ cell, it can give rise to offspring that carries the mutation {{in all of its}} cells. This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article DNA repair-deficiency disorder. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> is albinism, a mutation that occurs in the OCA1 or OCA2 gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision. On the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism, and certain mutations can cause the cell to become malignant, and, thus, cause cancer.|$|E
