Children <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> (n = 263 child-parent dyads) were enrolled during ED treatment for unintentional injury. Approximately 5 months later, children <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> (n = 178 dyads) completed standardized measures of posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> reported on child overall recovery. Follow-up assessments found significant posttraumatic stress symptoms in 15 % of children and 5 % of parents, significant depression symptoms in 13 % of children and 16 % of <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> problematic overall recovery in 17 % of children. For both children <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> posttraumatic stress <b>and</b> depression symptom severity were strongly associated. Child <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> symptoms were only modestly associated with each other, and there were few families in which both child <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> had significant posttraumatic stress or depression. Parent symptoms, but not child symptoms, were inversely associated with children's overall recovery. For about 1 in 6 children <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> unintentional injury treated in the ED can be associated with negative psychological sequelae and suboptimal recovery. Within families, child <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> responses may differ; their relative association with overall recovery deserves additional research.

40|$|National {{legislation}} such as South African Schools Act, No. 84 of 1996 introduced important reforms impacting {{on school}} <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> communication.

This study examined {{the role of the}} school principals in managing effective communication between educators <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> at schools to ensure that effective partnerships between educators <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> are achieved. A qualitative investigation in two public secondary schools in the Umbumbulu Circuit, KwaZulu-Natal was done. Data were gathered by means of in-depth interviews with the principals of each school, and focus group interviews with the educators <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> of each school and document analysis. The findings revealed the following: relationship between educators <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> is still very poor in some schools, the communication between educators <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> is still ineffective, there is still a lack of parental involvement in some schools, and most schools do not have policies on effective management of communication and comprehensive programmes on parental involvement. The study recommends that principals need to be empowered to effectively manage communication in their schools to ensure effective partnerships between educators <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> schools should design their own training programmes conducted by principals or specialists for parents on the importance of parental involvement in the education of their children.

Results: As children, young people <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> utilize services in this area of mental health, the roles of consumer and carer need redefinition to accommodate both young clients <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> as consumers, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> also as carers. Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the changing roles of <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> young clients from infancy to early adulthood to guide consumer and carer participation strategies. If child and adolescent mental health services are to apply a developmental perspective and engage both young clients <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> as 'consumers', they need to address challenges related to the differences in expectations and capacities of young clients <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> to the complexity associated with dual roles, and to promoting meaningful participation...|$|R

The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used objectively to perceive the smile attractiveness for each image. In addition, the patient <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> groups were given additional information regarding the average time taken to complete the treatment and asked to score on VAS. Results There were significant differences found in the VAS between the groups (p = 0. 002) and between the treatment options (P=< 0. 001) There was no statistically significant difference found between the aligned canines and substituted premolars images by the patient (p = 0. 2) or parent group (p = 0. 5).
