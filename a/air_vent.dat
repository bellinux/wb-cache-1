5|$|The {{enhanced}} performance VE range sold by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) is marketed as the E Series and it comprised the variants listed below. For the first time, {{in order to}} more greatly differentiate its products from the mainstream donor cars, HSV invested in revised sheetmetal (chiefly, different front fender panels with dedicated <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> and different tail lights). E Series HSV vehicles {{have been the most}} successful and mass-produced vehicles in HSV's history.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{imprisoned in}} a holding cell, but escapes by {{crawling}} through an <b>air</b> <b>vent.</b> Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear pool reactor. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later {{encounters}} {{the stranger}} {{as she walks}} into an elevator. Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} victim had been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery. Meanwhile, Padgett, who is Mulder's neighbor, stands on a chair with his ear to an <b>air</b> <b>vent,</b> listening to the conversation.|$|E

5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the <b>air</b> <b>vent,</b> which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, {{he stares at the}} thin slot and grins.|$|E

5|$|Snake {{enters the}} {{facility}} via an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> and locates the first hostage, DARPA Chief Donald Anderson. Anderson reveals that Metal Gear REX can be deactivated {{with a secret}} detonation override code, but dies of a heart attack. Colonel Campbell's niece Meryl Silverburgh, held hostage in an adjoining cell, helps Snake escape. Snake locates another hostage, ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, but is confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot. Their gunfight is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot's right hand. Baker briefs Snake on the Metal Gear project and advises him to contact Meryl, whom he gave a PAL card that might prevent the launch, but he too dies of a sudden heart attack.|$|E

U-376 was preceded by the mission's backup boat, , which had left from the same port on 27 March, but had had to return due to a defective <b>air</b> <b>vent,</b> and sailed again on 7 April.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cellar}} is promarily {{constructed}} of field stone and mortar, with a wood shingled gable roof on top. Access into the cellar is an inclined double wooden cellar {{door at the}} surface, down a set of stairs, and through a second wooden door {{at the bottom of}} the stairs. The cellar has a round <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> on one side and a square screened hole on the other, providing air movement into the cellar.|$|E
25|$|Another hypothesis, {{advanced}} {{by the original}} crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft. A similar hypothesis, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.|$|E

25|$|Covered by {{only four}} riflemen, he fought {{for four hours}} under terrific enemy small-arms fire and {{repeatedly}} returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers. He returned to the front, frequently {{to the rear of}} hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. At one point, a wisp of smoke alerted him to the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> of a Japanese bunker, and he approached close enough to put the nozzle of his flamethrower through the hole, killing the occupants. On another occasion, he was charged by enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and he killed them with a burst of flame from his weapon.|$|E
25|$|After {{being sentenced}} to death, Gissendaner resided in Metro State Prison {{until it was}} closed in 2011. She was then {{transferred}} to Arrendale State Prison. While in prison, Gissendaner had a conversion to Christianity. During her time in prison, Gissendaner ministered to other women living in prison with her. A group of women who were incarcerated with Gissendaner formed {{a group called the}} Struggle Sisters after they were released from prison. Kelly spoke to the women through an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> and prevented some from committing suicide, while other women tell of how Kelly’s words encouraged them to turn their lives around. The women released a video detailing the impact Gissendaner had on their lives.|$|E
25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} bleed <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.|$|E
