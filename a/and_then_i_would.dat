[...] Cast in April 2005, Owen spent several weeks collaborating with Cuarón and Sexton about his role. [...] Impressed by Owen's {{creative}} insights, Cuarón and Sexton brought him on board as a writer. [...] "Clive {{was a big}} help," [...] Cuarón told Variety. [...] "I would send a group of scenes to him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hear his feedback and instincts." ...|$|E
500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes. Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this." [...] Jenner explained, [...] "It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got {{the rest of my life}} to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?" ...|$|E
500|$|She enjoyed {{drinking}} Scotch and sherry; as {{friend and}} neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, [...] "She {{would come up}} and have a sherry, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> walk her home, and then she'd walk me back, {{and we would have}} another sherry. What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E

5000|$|Some people, {{including}} American {{attorney and}} legal analyst Ann-Margaret Carrozza, {{say that the}} Wevorce methodology may not be suitable for all couples going through divorce: [...] "If {{we have a couple}} who fight like cats <b>and</b> dogs, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> strongly caution against going the Wevorce route".|$|R

500|$|The {{unresolved}} {{question of}} {{what would happen to the}} Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was asked how he would avoid such a problem. His reply, [...] "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> strike inland", prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. [...] Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. Certain conditions were attached; £5million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.|$|E
500|$|It Was Written {{has been}} credited, along with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), with helping usher {{in the era}} of the mafioso rap. According to writer Sam Chennault, while the hip hop subgenre would [...] "run out of steam quickly, this release is a gem." [...] Chennault also {{discussed}} the significance of It Was Written during the period of its release, stating [...] "after mastering stark street corner realism on Illmatic, Nas delivered a loose concept album that was, at the time, groundbreaking in its scope, approach and execution." [...] According to rapper Young Noble, a close friend of Tupac Shakur, the song [...] "I Gave You Power" [...] served as the main inspiration for Shakur's [...] "" [...] (1996). American hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco has cited It Was Written as his favorite album and his primary source of inspiration. Fiasco has stated that he based his debut album Food & Liquor (2006) on the conceptual style and [...] "moods" [...] of It Was Written. When asked of his musical influences in an interview with AllHipHop.com, Fiasco stated [...] "You know I really tried to go back and recreate [...] It Was Written, you know what I'm saying like that? [...] It Was Written <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> play my album, and it was like, ‘Do we got [...] record, do we got that record?’" [...] When asked in an interview with NobodySmiling.com about why he is comfortable admitting the album as a source of inspiration, Fiasco stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time ever Danilova has brought in session musicians: Nick Johnson (drums, who {{is also a member of}} her live band), Sean McCann (viola, violin) and Ryan York (cello, double bass). [...] "I can't play violin or cello or {{stand-up}} bass, or drums. I can play keyboards, kind of. So all the keyboard parts I wrote and played, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> send the string parts that I had wrote on the keyboard to the string players and they would just mimic that. Same with the drums. I try to do as much as possible, still, but I wish I could play drums", she explained.|$|E

I came back and found him strolling up and down the deck, as if he were taking {{a breath of fresh air}} before turning in, like any other evening.|$|R

2500|$|During World War II, Round {{became a}} fighter {{pilot in the}} Royal Air Force and was posted to Canada and then the No. 1 British Flying Training School in Terrell, Texas, serving as a flying {{instructor}} for the United States Air Force. He then began his performing career, later recalling, [...] "I was {{doing a lot of}} singing every Sunday in churches all over Texas. I had my own plane so I would fly down 300 miles to San Antonio for an 11 a.m. service, I would sing <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fly back home in the evening." [...] He also performed on the radio and was offered the chance to appear as a guest in a college production in Dallas, playing Canio in Pagliacci. [...] "It was my first time in any type of production but I loved it." [...] Round was offered a place at a music school in New York, but turned it down to return home to England in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|With an {{interest}} in costume history, she initially worked closely with J. Michael Straczinski {{to get a sense}} of the historical perspective of the major alien races, [...] "so I knew if they were a peaceful people or a warring people, cold climate etc. <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> interpret what kind of sensibility that called for." [...] Collaborating with other departments to establish co-ordinated visual themes for each race, a broad palette of colors was developed with Iacovelli, which he referred to as [...] "spicy brights". These warm shades of grey and secondary colors, such as certain blues for the Minbari, would often be included when designing both the costumes and relevant sets. As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as [...] "surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors", so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador Londo Mollari's purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly colored as Bruice felt [...] "Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker." ...|$|E

So <b>then</b> <b>I</b> judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then,</b> too, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{think of}} that other thing that Cavalcanti had said: that I had been hasty in my {{judgment}} of his daughter's mind.
