EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the enterprise’s acquisition of <b>a</b> <b>subsidiary’s</b> mandatorily redeemable preferred stock should be accounted for as a capital stock transaction. [Note: See STATUS section. ] Accordingly, the consolidated entity would not recognize in its income statement any gain or loss from the acquisition of the subsidiary’s preferred stock. The Task Force members noted that, in the consolidated financial statements, the dividends on <b>a</b> <b>subsidiary’s</b> preferred stock, whether mandatorily redeemable or not, would be included in noncontrolling interest as a charge against income.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of local (external) network embeddedness for <b>an</b> MNC <b>subsidiary's</b> ability to create new knowledge, a crucial question is what factors affect this local embeddedness. Despite its obvious relevance, few efforts {{have been made in}} the MNC literature to deal with this issue. In this paper, we hypothesize that <b>a</b> <b>subsidiary's</b> local embeddedness is influenced by headquarters' use of different control mechanisms, and that local embeddedness, in turn, is an important antecedent to <b>a</b> <b>subsidiary's</b> level of knowledge creation. The model is tested on a dataset of MNC subsidiaries in Finland and China. The results indicate that MNC headquarters can indeed influence subsidiary local network embeddedness, which in turn enhances subsidiary knowledge creation.
