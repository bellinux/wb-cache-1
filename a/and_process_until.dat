50|$|The mill was {{purchased}} by brothers Charles and Frederick Schwamb in 1864 for the manufacture of circular and elliptical picture frames. It remained within the family's ownership and continued to operate, more or less unchanged in both equipment <b>and</b> <b>processes,</b> <b>until</b> 1969. Two wings were added during this time: one by 1881, and the other between that date and 1898. In 1969 the property was acquired by a non-profit organization formed to preserve the property.|$|R

The New Meadow has a 10,000 all-seated capacity, with the scope to expand to beyond 40,000.

30|$|In the {{treatment}} to the patient, the doctor sets an applicator into the holder and switches to trigger seed sending.

50|$|If similar Production error {{occurred}} in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new Production error then new Production error resolution steps are created and Production error is resolved. The new Production error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for the future usage. For major Production errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error. This is also called as an Incident Management. If a problem occurs repeatedly then it is recorded and tracked using appropriate tools <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>until</b> it is resolved permanently. This is also called as Problem Management. The issue is closed only after the customer or end user agrees that the problem is resolved.|$|R

5000|$|Forward selection, which {{involves}} starting with no {{variables in the}} model, testing the addition of each variable using a chosen model fit criterion, adding the variable (if any) whose inclusion gives the most statistically significant improvement of the fit, <b>and</b> repeating this <b>process</b> <b>until</b> none improves the model to a statistically significant extent.|$|R

50|$|The {{treatments}} {{that are available}} are mostly behavioral and cognitive therapies, the most common being behavioral. One method of behavioral therapy for traumatophobia is to expose the client to the stimuli, in this case being exposure to blood, injury, and injections, <b>and</b> repeat the <b>process</b> <b>until</b> the client’s reactions are less and/or cured. Hypnotherapy is also an option.|$|R
5000|$|Backward elimination, which {{involves}} starting with all candidate variables, testing the deletion of each variable using a chosen model fit criterion, deleting the variable (if any) whose loss gives the most statistically insignificant {{deterioration of the}} model fit, <b>and</b> repeating this <b>process</b> <b>until</b> no further variables can be deleted without a statistically significant loss of fit.|$|R

30|$|The chosen {{event is}} then performed, and updates the network in its defined manner. The {{simulation}} time is then incremented by τ <b>and</b> the <b>process</b> repeats, <b>until</b> a set time-limit is exceeded {{or there is}} no possibility of any event occurring (i.e. a= 0).|$|R
50|$|If {{a series}} of sweeps does not find the object, one of the fixed jackstays may be lifted and re-laid on the {{opposite}} side of the remaining one, <b>and</b> the <b>process</b> repeated <b>until</b> the target is found or the entire search area has been searched.|$|R
50|$|When the batch is complete, a new batch is {{inducted}} <b>and</b> the <b>process</b> repeated <b>until</b> {{the wave}} is complete.

40|$|International audienceMeteorology is {{the main}} driving force of {{hydrology}} along time, from the instantaneous states <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>until</b> the monthly, seasonal, yearly, and sometimes multiyear sequences. Meteorology drives and impacts much of the hydrological flows and storages, thus water balance terms as well as hazards, across a geometric and functional interface. This interface develops within a certain thickness, yet thin regarding the planetary radius and critical for water and other dynamics. This heterogeneous Critical Zone ranges {{from the bottom of}} groundwater reservoirs {{to the top of the}} tree canopy [1], including surface water liquid and frozen and gaseous flows and storages. Complex space-time effects develop in this critical zone such as orographic and oceanic influences on moisture-precipitation dynamics, hydrogeomorphological structure-function relationships, upstream-downstream integration, subsystems connectivities, variability interdependences, and scaling issues [2 – 6]. In some geographic settings, this critical zone is further complexified by extreme conditions of some of the properties, such as dryness or wetness, groundwater geometries and dynamics, cryospheric developments (snow, ice, and permafrost), soil and land covers, water uses, and concentration of water-driven chemicals...|$|R
30|$|Heuristic {{approaches}} {{can also}} be found in the literature. Iterative cancellation methods estimate the prominent f 0 subtracting it from the mixture <b>and</b> repeating the <b>process</b> <b>until</b> a termination criterion [16 – 18]. Joint estimation methods [19 – 21] can evaluate a set of possible f 0 hypotheses, consisting of f 0 combinations, selecting the most likely at each frame without corrupting the residual as it occurs with iterative cancellation.|$|R
30|$|In {{large and}} complex networks, {{communities}} cannot be detected by shear intuition; but literature has provided several methods for this purpose. These methods can be grouped into two categories: division methods, and aggregation methods (Clauset et al. 2004; Girvan and Newman 2002; Newman 2006; Newman and Girvan 2004; Pons and Latapy 2005; Radicchi et al. 2004; Wu and Huberman 2004). Division methods assume the entire network {{as a large}} community and then select the vertices most suited for isolation. These methods divide the network to its communities <b>and</b> continue this <b>process</b> <b>until</b> the generated communities exhibit the desired quality, i.e. when vertices of each community have {{a high degree of}} inter-connection and relatively low connection with vertices of other communities. Aggregation methods first assume each vertex as a minuscule community, and then determine the vertex most suited for formation of a larger community (containing two vertices). These methods aggregate the vertices to form the most suitable communities, and then examine the addition of remaining vertices to existing communities, <b>and</b> repeat this <b>process</b> <b>until</b> the generated communities exhibit the above-mentioned quality.|$|R
