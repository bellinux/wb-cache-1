25|$|Pseudoephedrine {{can be used}} {{either as}} oral or as topical decongestant. However, due to its {{stimulating}} qualities, the topical nasal preparation {{is more likely to}} cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an <b>antitussive</b> drug (suppression of cough).|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{had already}} been {{isolated}} in Germany by German pharmacist Friedrich Sertürner in 1804. Codeine was first isolated decades later in 1832 in France by Pierre Robiquet, a French chemist and pharmacist already famous for the discovery of alizarin, the most widespread red dye, while working on refined morphine extraction processes. This {{paved the way for}} the elaboration of a new generation of safer, codeine-based specific <b>antitussive</b> and antidiarrheal formulations.|$|E
25|$|The Persian {{physician}} Abū ‘Alī al-Husayn ibn Sina ("Avicenna") described opium as {{the most}} powerful of the stupefacients, in comparison to mandrake and other highly effective herbs, in The Canon of Medicine. The text lists medicinal effects of opium, such as analgesia, hypnosis, <b>antitussive</b> effects, gastrointestinal effects, cognitive effects, respiratory depression, neuromuscular disturbances, and sexual dysfunction. It also refers to opium's potential as a poison. Avicenna describes several methods of delivery and recommendations for doses of the drug. This classic text was translated into Latin in 1175 and later into many other languages and remained authoritative until the 19th century. Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu used opium in the 14th-century Ottoman Empire to treat migraine headaches, sciatica, and other painful ailments.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, some {{pharmacological}} effects, such as molluscicidal anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, antidermatophytic, <b>antitussives</b> and cytotoxic {{activities have}} been demonstrated in the saponins of plants.|$|R
50|$|Oxeladin {{differs from}} common <b>antitussives</b> that cause {{addiction}} (such as etilmorphin, codeine or its derivatives) {{in that there}} is no evidence of risk of addiction or dependence.|$|R
50|$|The cough {{center of}} the brain is a region of the brain which {{controls}} coughing, located in the medulla oblongata area of the brain. <b>Antitussives</b> and other cough medicines focus their action on the cough center.|$|R
25|$|Natural gums are {{vegetable}} exudates {{that are}} released {{as the result}} of damage to the plant such as that resulting from the attack of an insect or a natural or artificial cut. These exudates contain heterogeneous polysaccharides formed of different sugars and usually containing uronic acids. They form viscous colloidal solutions. There are different species that produce gums. The most important of these species belong to the leguminosae. They are widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and textile sectors. They also have interesting therapeutic properties; for example gum arabic is <b>antitussive</b> and anti-inflammatory. The most well known gums are tragacanth (Astragalus gummifer), gum arabic (Acacia senegal) and guar gum (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba).|$|E
25|$|The racemic parent {{compound}} racemorphan was first {{described in a}} Swiss and US patent application from Hoffmann-La Roche in 1946 and 1947, respectively; a patent was granted in 1950. A resolution of the two isomers of racemorphan with tartaric acid was published in 1952, and DXM was successfully tested in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine. DXM {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1958 as an over-the-counter <b>antitussive.</b> As had been initially hoped, DXM was a solution for some of the problems {{associated with the use of}} codeine phosphate as a cough suppressant, such as sedation and opiate dependence, but like the dissociative anesthetics phencyclidine and ketamine, DXM later became associated with nonmedical use.|$|E
500|$|In China {{it is used}} as a {{medicinal}} herb with febrifugal, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic effects. Additionally, it is also used for treating sore throats and tonsillitis. Recent pharmacological investigations have revealed that the Asiatic dayflower contains at least five active compounds. One of these, p-hydroxycinnamic acid, shows antibacterial activity, while another, D-mannitol, has an <b>antitussive</b> effect. In China and India the plant is also used as a vegetable and fodder crop.|$|E
40|$|We could {{determine}} carbetapentane, clobutinol and oxeladin, tertiary amino <b>antitussives,</b> with extremely high sensitivity by gas chromatography with surface ionization detection (GC-SID). The calibration curves showed satisfactory linearity {{in the range}} of 50 - 800 pg on column and the detection limit was about 30 pg on column (1. 5 ng/ml). Solid extraction method with Sep-pak C 18 cartridges was useful for purification of these <b>antitussives</b> from body fluids. We also quantitated oxeladin in whole blood and urine of a healthy volunteer 3 h after the administration; the concentrations were 12. 7 ng/ml in the whole blood and 72. 8 ng/ml in the urine. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
50|$|Overdosage {{leads to}} drowsiness, agitation, nausea and {{anticholinergic}} effects like tachycardia (high heart rate), dry mouth, blurred vision, glaucoma, or urinary retention. Especially in children, pentoxyverine can cause hypoventilation, {{but much more}} seldom than codeine and other opioid <b>antitussives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine (RAM-318) is an opiate {{analgesic}} drug, {{which is}} also an active metabolite of oxycodone and hydromorphinol. 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine is not currently marketed in any developed country, but has been of interest to pharmaceutical companies looking for new analgesics and <b>antitussives.</b>|$|R
500|$|Sundews {{were used}} as {{medicinal}} herbs {{as early as the}} 12th century, when an Italian doctor from the School of Salerno, Matthaeus Platearius, described the plant as an herbal remedy for coughs under the name herba sole. It has been used commonly in cough preparations in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Sundew tea was especially recommended by herbalists for dry coughs, bronchitis, whooping cough, asthma and [...] "bronchial cramps". A modern study has shown that Drosera exhibits <b>antitussive</b> properties.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern {{formulations}} of opium tincture {{do not contain}} the alkaloid narcotine (also known as noscapine), which has <b>antitussive</b> properties. [...] Even modest doses of narcotine can induce profound nausea and vomiting. Since opium tincture is usually prescribed for its antidiarrheal and analgesic properties (rather than as an <b>antitussive),</b> opium tincture without narcotine is generally preferred. [...] This [...] "de-narcotized" [...] or [...] "deodorized" [...] opium tincture is formulated using a petroleum distillate to remove the narcotine.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another study}} {{performed}} with non-smoking patients, it demonstrates that oral administration of Passiflora incarnata following extubation for patient surgery reduced the patients coughing versus the control group. The present study presents that administering Passiflora incarnata orally {{with the correct}} dosage can result in <b>antitussive</b> activities without impairing the patient drastically.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Antibiotics, <b>antitussives</b> and mucolytics are {{commonly}} used in asthma, despite limited evidence for their effectiveness. The correlates of use for these medication classes in asthma were identified. METHODS: Asthma patients aged 18 - 50 who were regular customers of pharmacies were included in an observational study. Patients completed a questionnaire, which was complemented by computerised pharmacy records of previously dispensed medications. Users of each drug class were compared to non-users in terms of demographics, asthma characteristics and management. RESULTS: Among 886 patients (mean age: 37; 55 % females), 63. 2 %, 55. 8 % and 27. 2 %, respectively, were users of antibiotics, mucolytics and <b>antitussives</b> during the previous 12 months. In multivariate analysis, dispensing of > 2 units of oral corticosteroids was the major correlate of receiving antibiotics (OR= 5. 47; 95 % CI=[3. 00 - 9. 97]), mucolytics (OR= 3. 93; 95 % CI=[2. 38 - 6. 50]) and <b>antitussives</b> (OR= 1. 86; 95 % CI=[1. 18 - 2. 94]). Compared to well-controlled patients, the probability of receiving antibiotics was significantly higher for poorly controlled patients (OR= 2. 01; 95 % CI=[1. 28 - 3. 15]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that these drugs are mainly used during asthma exacerbations. A {{better understanding of the}} use of co-medication in asthma is required...|$|R
50|$|The drug is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of dry cough associated with conditions such as common cold, bronchitis or sinusitis. Like codeine and other <b>antitussives,</b> it relieves the symptom, but does not heal the illness. No controlled clinical trials regarding the efficiency of pentoyxverine are available.|$|R
30|$|As yet no RCT based {{evidence}} exists for synthetic drugs {{as opposed to}} herbal compounds for acute bronchitis. Yet, in randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) largely used older, patent-free synthetic substances i.e., muco-active drugs, <b>antitussives,</b> antihistamines, NSAR (non-steroidal anti-rheumatics) with a distinct straightforward pathophysiological target do not have proven clinical benefit vs. placebo [14].|$|R
2500|$|Serotonergic {{action is}} {{terminated}} primarily via uptake of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific monoamine transporter for 5-HT, SERT, on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including cocaine, dextromethorphan (an <b>antitussive),</b> tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A 2006 {{study conducted by}} the University of Washington suggested that a newly discovered monoamine transporter, known as PMAT, may account for [...] "a significant percentage of 5-HT clearance".|$|E
2500|$|Approved {{indication}} for dihydrocodeine is {{the management}} of moderate to moderately severe pain as well as coughing and shortness of breath. [...] As {{is the case with}} other drugs in this group, the <b>antitussive</b> dose tends to be less than the analgesic dose, and dihydrocodeine is a powerful cough suppressant like all other members of the immediate codeine family (see below) and their cousins hydrocodone, oxycodone and ethylmorphine, whole opium preparations, and the strong opioid hydromorphone.|$|E
2500|$|Japan : In Japan, {{dihydrocodeine}} {{is available}} without a prescription; used in cough medicines such as New Bron Solution-ACE. [...] Dihydrocodeine {{is used as}} an <b>antitussive</b> in many products as a Dextromethorphan alternative. [...] Medicines in Japan which contain dihydrocodeine are coupled with caffeine to offset the sedative effects and discourage recreational use. [...] Cough medicines containing dihydrocodeine are controlled similarly to dextromethrophan in the United States, in that its sale is strictly limited by purchase quantity and is restricted to persons 20 and older for purchase.|$|E
50|$|Carbocisteine (INN), {{also called}} {{carbocysteine}} (USAN), is a mucolytic {{that reduces the}} viscosity of sputum and so {{can be used to}} help relieve the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and bronchiectasis by allowing the sufferer to bring up sputum more easily. Carbocisteine should not be used with <b>antitussives</b> (cough suppressants) or medicines that dry up bronchial secretions.|$|R
25|$|In {{the medical}} context, psychoactive drugs as a {{treatment}} for illness is widespread and generally accepted. Little controversy exists concerning over the counter psychoactive medications in antiemetics and <b>antitussives.</b> Psychoactive drugs are commonly prescribed to patients with psychiatric disorders. However, certain critics believe that certain prescription psychoactives, such as antidepressants and stimulants, are overprescribed and threaten patients' judgement and autonomy.|$|R
25|$|Morphine-derived agonist–antagonist {{drugs have}} also been developed. Elements of the {{morphine}} structure {{have been used to}} create completely synthetic drugs such as the morphinan family (levorphanol, dextromethorphan and others) and other groups that have many members with morphine-like qualities. The modification of morphine and the aforementioned synthetics has also given rise to non-narcotic drugs with other uses such as emetics, stimulants, <b>antitussives,</b> anticholinergics, muscle relaxants, local anaesthetics, general anaesthetics, and others.|$|R
2500|$|Dextropropoxyphene is an {{analgesic}} in the opioid category, patented in 1955 {{and manufactured}} by Eli Lilly and Company. [...] It is an optical isomer of levopropoxyphene. It {{is intended to}} treat mild pain and also has <b>antitussive</b> (cough suppressant) and local anaesthetic effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias. Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) {{is said to be}} 20–30 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5–2 hours after oral administration.|$|E
2500|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, dextromethorphan acts centrally (meaning that it acts on the brain) {{as opposed}} to locally (on the respiratory tract). It elevates the threshold for coughing, without inhibiting ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into the active metabolite dextrorphan in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. The average dose necessary for effective <b>antitussive</b> therapy is between 10 and 45mg, depending on the individual. The International Society for the Study of Cough recommends [...] "an adequate first dose of medication is 60 mg in the adult and repeat dosing should be infrequent rather than the [...] recommended." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Indonesia, the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM-RI) {{prohibited}} single-component dextromethorphan drug sales with {{or without}} prescription. Indonesia {{is the only country}} in the world that makes single-component dextromethorphan illegal even by prescription and violators may be prosecuted by law. National Anti-Narcotics Agency (BNN RI) has even threatened to revoke pharmacies' and drug stores' licenses if they still stock dextromethorphan, and will notify the police for criminal prosecution. As a result of this regulation, 130 drugs have been withdrawn from the market, but drugs containing multicomponent dextromethorphan can be sold over the counter. In its official press release, BPOM-RI also stated that dextromethorphan is often used as a substitute for marijuana, amphetamine, and heroin by drug abusers, and its use as an <b>antitussive</b> is less beneficial nowadays ...|$|E
50|$|Fenspiride (INN, {{brand names}} Eurespal, Pneumorel and others) is an oxazolidinone spiro {{compound}} {{used as a}} drug {{in the treatment of}} certain respiratory diseases. The pharmacotherapeutic classification is <b>antitussives.</b> In Russia it is approved for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases of ENT organs (ear, nose, throat) and the respiratory tract (like rhinopharyngitis, laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, otitis and sinusitis), as well as for maintenance treatment of asthma.|$|R
50|$|Morphine-derived agonist-antagonist {{drugs have}} also been developed.

30|$|Acute bronchitis, {{frequently}} emerging {{with the}} common cold {{is one of the}} most frequent causes of primary care consultations. It is a self-limiting disease which poses both high symptom burden to individuals and high financial burden to society. It is largely a viral disease (~ 50  % rhinovirus infection), but no causal (antiviral) treatment exists. Antibiotics, mucoactive agents, antihistamines, <b>antitussives,</b> decongestants are most often used but without evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) for relieving symptoms or fostering recovery.|$|R
