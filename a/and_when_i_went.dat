25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

At the Billboard Latin Music Awards in Miami, A.B. told E! that Gomez gave a [...] "fantastic vocal {{performance}} on the record". Gomez told JustJared.com, [...] "I was completely honored when {{they asked me to}} be on the tribute CD <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into the studio to record they actually had her vocals in the booth that she was in, so I felt like she was singing right next to me, it gave me chills! It was incredible {{and it was a great}} experience and it was a great song." [...] Domingo Banda of the Semana News called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] a [...] "standout track". Guerra, however, wrote that the new version of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was ...|$|E
500|$|She {{had a small}} role in the 2005 romantic drama Shopgirl {{and played}} the {{babysitter}} of George and Kathy Lutz's children in The Amityville Horror (2005). For the latter role she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. [...] " [...] Michael Bay has these gigantic [...] [...] <b>And,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition {{to think of what}} would scare me the most." [...] The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh no! I {{should not}} like that. I had rather be doing {{something}} for you, Willie. Look here, I am learning all <b>I</b> can now, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out--' ...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{critics have}} accused MEMRI of selectivity. They state that MEMRI {{consistently}} picks for translation and dissemination {{the most extreme}} views, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Juan Cole, a professor of Modern Middle East History at the University of Michigan, argues MEMRI {{has a tendency to}} [...] "cleverly cherry-pick the vast Arabic press, which serves 300 million people, for the most extreme and objectionable articles and editorials... On more than one occasion I have seen, say, a bigoted Arabic article translated by MEMRI <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the source on the web, found that it was on the same op-ed page with other, moderate articles arguing for tolerance. These latter were not translated." [...] Former head of the CIA's counterintelligence unit, Vincent Cannistraro, said that MEMRI [...] "are selective and act as propagandists for their political point of view, which is the extreme-right of Likud. They simply don't present the whole picture." [...] Laila Lalami, writing in The Nation, states that MEMRI [...] "consistently picks the most violent, hateful rubbish it can find, translates it and distributes it in email newsletters to media and members of Congress in Washington". As a result, critics such as UK Labour politician Ken Livingstone state, MEMRI's analyses are [...] "distortion".|$|E

60|$|Here I possess these {{gathered}} {{treasures of}} time, {{the harvest of}} so many generations, laid up in my garners: <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to the window there is the lake, and the circle of the mountains, and the illimitable sky.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, yes; {{he ordered}} me to use it on certain nights; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to England he says I must never be without one. I see now that was why my inner self {{invariably}} went wrong in England. It was all just the sulphur blackening the bangles.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought at}} first that his lordship must have fainted," [...] he said. [...] "I heard a queer noise, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in, he had fallen forward across the table. Parkins has rung for Doctor Wilcox." ...|$|E

60|$|I don't {{know how}} {{the rest of the night}} passed. I only find my memory again when the morning came, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out by myself to breathe the crisp wintry air on the open moor behind the inn.|$|E
60|$|I {{am in the}} Law, but not of it. I can't exactly {{make out}} what it means. I sit in Westminster Hall {{sometimes}} (in character) from ten to four; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out of Court, I don't know whether I am standing on my wig or my boots.|$|R
40|$|Whenever I {{think of}} ‘teaching’ I {{always come back}} to one {{singular}} overarching thought—the power of the relational, and the values of empathy, diversity, and interdependency. I am reminded of this <b>when</b> <b>I</b> meet students for the first time, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see them in ongoing mentorship roles, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to schools <b>and</b> communities...|$|R

"Your time shall come then, I-Gos," [...] Gahan {{assured the}} other, [...] "and {{if you have}} any party that thinks as you do, prepare them for the eventuality that will succeed O-Tar's presumptuous attempt to wed the {{daughter}} of The Warlord.

60|$|Once I heard {{a wounded}} bird give {{three or four}} beats of his drum-call, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into the grapevine thicket, where he had fallen, I found him lying flat on his back, beating his sides with his wings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know how}} it was," [...] said Whopper, as the full truth dawned on him. [...] "I ate a very hearty supper last night, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to bed my head was full of those two bears we brought down. That gave me the nightmare." ...|$|E
60|$|Last evening {{there was}} the most {{beautiful}} moonlight that ever hallowed this earthly world; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to bathe in the river, which was as calm as death, it seemed like plunging down into the sky. But I had rather be on earth than even in the seventh heaven, just now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too," [...] said Hilda, enjoying a childlike {{pleasure}} {{in her own}} idea. [...] "The theme is better suited for verse than prose; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> home to America, I will suggest {{it to one of}} our poets. Or seven poets might write the poem together, each lighting a separate branch of the Sacred Candlestick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no use {{getting into}} a fuss about it, mother," [...] Jack said cheerfully; [...] "it {{is not going to}} happen again, you know. It has been a good lesson to me to keep my eyes open; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> {{cockling}} again <b>I</b> won't lose sight of the boat, not if there were twenty vessels ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is {{the oddest}} thing I ever heard. I know just such an old lady, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> home I'll try your plan. It {{seems to me that}} you have a great many queer old ladies on this island," [...] I said to another man, whom they called Peter, and who stood eating pumpkin all the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it was a}} odd thing, {{but when}} the animiles see us a-talkin' they lay down, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever.

6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} we shall get a {{domiciliary}} visit presently," [...] continued Pere Lenegre, after a slight pause. [...] "The gendarmes have not yet been, but I fancy that already this morning early I saw {{one or two of}} the Committee's spies hanging about the house, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the workshop I was followed all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't get {{any work}} to do anywhere. I walked my legs off looking for work. I did get a job once, but I was off for a week because I was queer, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> back they said they didn't want me any more. You can't blame them either, can you? Them places, they can't afford to have girls that aren't strong." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "One of the bitterest {{feelings}} I {{have is that}} a man so dear to me {{should live}} so near to me, and that I should see so little of him. But what can I do? He will not come to my house; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to his he is angry with me because I wear a shovel hat and ride on horseback." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{used to like}} them, {{and still}} think them good for young girls, with our own 'Queechy' and 'Wide, Wide World,' and books of that kind. Now I'm {{eighteen}} I prefer stronger novels, and books by great men and women, because these are always talked about by cultivated people, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into society next winter I wish {{to be able to}} listen intelligently, and know what to admire." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{was what}} he wanted, then,--social recognition. I said nothing, but I saw my opportunity: I had the clew, now, to a certain {{attitude}} he had adopted of late toward me, an attitude of reproach; as though, in return for his many favours to me, there were something I had left undone. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> home I asked Maude to call on Mrs. Scherer.|$|E
60|$|A soft, {{warbling}} sound, {{uttered by}} no bird, {{came up from}} the shadowy bushes far below; and in that direction I ran on; then pausing, called again. The sweet sound was repeated once more, but much lower down now, and so faintly that I scarcely heard it. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on further and called again and again, there was no reply, and I {{knew that she had}} indeed gone on that long journey alone.|$|E
60|$|Now {{she wanted}} to know how I had managed {{to get on with the}} bear, and what the people at the Cheltenham said about it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on to tell her the whole story, which I did at {{considerable}} length, she was intensely interested. She shuddered at the runaway, she laughed heartily at the uprising of the McKenna sister, and she listened earnestly to everything I had to say about the Larramies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{come for}} this man, whom you may all see has {{good reason to}} fear me. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> take part of him with me. I be in a great hurry, so I would prefer to take my great and good friend, Peter of Colfax, without interference; but, if you wish it otherwise; we be a score strong within your walls, and nigh a {{thousand}} lie without. What say you, My Lord?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{up to my}} dearie's room, all pale <b>and</b> shaking. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in {{she came}} to meet me, like a girl going to meet death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mother, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> home <b>I</b> mean to have {{a corner}} in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to make. The woman's face is not good, it's too {{beautiful}} for me to draw, but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that helps me." ...|$|R
