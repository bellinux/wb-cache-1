50|$|After Strutt's death, {{the estate}} at Glensanda was {{inherited}} {{by his son}} Arthur <b>and</b> then shared, <b>in</b> 1930, with Arthur's New Zealand wife, Patricia. Arthur died <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> <b>circumstances.</b> He went out one morning <b>in</b> 1977 <b>and</b> never returned; five years later he was presumed to be dead. On the Monday following his memorial service his body was found. His clothed skeleton was discovered {{half a mile from}} his home by forestry workers, {{but it was too late}} to ascertain his cause of death.|$|R
25|$|Following a {{successful}} domestic {{season in which}} Sammy finished as the Windward Islands' second highest wicket-taker in the Regional Four Day Competition with 22scalps and 261runs, {{he was the only}} uncapped player selected in the 15-man West Indies squad for the NatWest Triangular One Day International Series with England <b>and</b> New Zealand <b>in</b> June 2004. Counting in favour of his selection was Sammy's experience of English conditions: in 2003 he played for Barnes Cricket Club in the Middlesex Premier Cricket League. He subsequently earned his first West Indies cap <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Due to heavy rain the West Indies' match against New Zealand at the Rose Bowl was abandoned without a ball being bowled. But the captains had already completed the toss, and the fixture counts in ICC records as Sammy's first match.|$|R
50|$|The Arkaba Projects (1957-1967) are a {{range of}} works {{undertaken}} during the ongoing association between architect Robert Dickson and entrepreneur Istvan (Steve) Zsolt, consisting of restaurants, flats, motels, <b>and</b> hotels.Typically <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> or difficult <b>circumstances,</b> the projects often commenced with little preparation and required urgent design and construction responses. The architectural opportunities he presented were challenging, although this meant an increased responsibility <b>in</b> design expression <b>and</b> also made for unique design freedom.The Arkaba restaurant <b>and</b> hotel complex <b>in</b> Fullarton were the practice’s first large scale commercial project and known for its intimate planning and straight forward use of natural materials.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel use of data mining algorithms for extraction of knowledge from {{a set of}} process plans. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to apply data mining methodologies to explore the patterns in data generated by genetic-algorithm-generating process plans and to develop a rule set planner, which helps to make decisions <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Genetic algorithms are random-search algorithms based on the mechanics of genetics and natural selection. Because of genetic inheritance, the characteristics of the survivors after several generations should be similar. The solutions of a genetic algorithms for process planning consists of the operation sequence of a job, the machine on which each operation is performed, the tool used for performing each operation, and the tool approach direction. Among the optimal or near-optimal solutions, similar relationships may exist between the characteristics of the operation and sequential order. Data mining software known as See 5 has been used to explore the relationship between the operation’s sequence and its attributes, and a set of rules has been developed. These rules can predict the positions of operations in the sequence of process planning...|$|R

50|$|Bluetooth is a packet-based {{protocol}} with a master/slave architecture. One master may {{communicate with}} up to seven slaves in a piconet. All devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange {{is based on the}} basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5 µs intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625 µs, and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250 µs. In the simple case of single-slot packets the master transmits <b>in</b> even slots <b>and</b> receives <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> slots. The slave, conversely, receives <b>in</b> even slots <b>and</b> transmits <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins <b>in</b> even slots <b>and</b> the slave's <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> slots.|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} bent {{functions}} which contains bent functions with various properties like regular, weakly regular and not weakly regular bent functions <b>in</b> even <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> dimension, is analyzed. It is shown that {{this class includes}} the Maiorana-McFarland class as a special case. Known classes and examples of bent functions <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> characteristic are examined for their relation to this class. In the second part, normality for bent functions <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> characteristic is analyzed. It turns out that differently to Boolean bent functions, many - also quadratic - bent functions <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> characteristic <b>and</b> even dimension are not normal. It is shown that regular Coulter-Matthews bent functions are normal...|$|R

40|$|We derive {{necessary}} {{conditions for}} the spinorial Witten-Nester energy to be well-defined for asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes. We find that the conformal boundary should admit a spinor satisfying certain differential conditions <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> dimensions the boundary metric should be conformally Einstein. We show that these conditions are satisfied by asymptotically AdS spacetimes. The gravitational energy (obtained using the holographic stress energy tensor) and the spinorial energy are equal <b>in</b> even dimensions <b>and</b> differ by a bounded quantity related to the conformal anomaly <b>in</b> <b>odd</b> dimensions.
