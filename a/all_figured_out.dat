2500|$|Voyager1 {{was first}} of the two probes to {{encounter}} the Jupiter system in March 1979. On approach to Jupiter in late February and early March 1979, Voyager imaging scientists noticed that Io appeared distinct from the other Galilean satellites. Its surface was orange in color and marked by dark spots, which were initially interpreted as the sites of impact craters. Among the most intriguing features was a heart-shaped, dark ring [...] across that would later {{turn out to be}} the plume deposit of the volcano Pele. The data from the Ultraviolet Spectrometer(UVS) revealed a torus of plasma composed of sulfur ions at the orbit of Io, but tilted to match the equator of Jupiter's magnetic field. The Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP) detector encountered streams of sodium, sulfur, and oxygen ions prior to entering Jupiter's magnetosphere, material that the LECP science team suspected originated from Io. In the hours prior to Voyager 1s encounter with Io, the spacecraft acquired images for a global map with a resolution of at least [...] per pixel over the satellite's leading hemisphere (the side that faces the moon's direction of motion around Jupiter) down to less than [...] per pixel over portions of the sub-Jovian hemisphere (the [...] "near" [...] side of Io). The images returned during the approach revealed a strange, multi-colored landscape devoid of impact craters, unlike the other planetary surfaces imaged to that point such as the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. The dark spots in earlier images resembled volcanic calderas more than they did the impact craters seen on those other worlds. Stunned by the oddity of Io's surface, Voyager imaging scientist Laurence Soderblom at a pre-encounter press conference joked, [...] "this one we got <b>all</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out...</b> is covered with thin candy shells of anything from sulfates and sulfur and salts to all kinds of strange things." ...|$|E

He asserted at a public meeting that there was a Jewish conspiracy in which the Rothschilds were plotting to acquire all of Canada's mines through non-Jewish third party operatives, and that the family was part of an international Jewish conspiracy to take over all of Canada's businesses. Carmichael was cautioned by the Social Credit Party of Ontario that he was [...] "skating on thin ice" [...] and would not be permitted to stand as a candidate again. His promise that a Social Credit government would pay each Canadian $5,000 worth of goods and services was derided by the Ontario party as [...] "irresponsible".

In the same meeting Carmichael declared that Adolf Hitler's economic system was [...] "a very good and sound system of money" [...] and that the Nazis [...] "had it <b>all</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> so that there was no unemployment."
