5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. <b>A</b> <b>Creature</b> of Light and <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{may have}} evolved from <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> {{similar to a}} coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae {{resemble}} primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E

5|$|Orcadian {{folklore}} had {{a strong}} Scandinavian influence, {{and it may be}} that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.|$|E
5|$|A man—whose face {{is hidden}} from the camera—drives up to and enters a house, which has an ominous symbol drawn in blood on the door. When he's inside, <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> that looks {{somewhat}} human-like approaches the woman but the mysterious man shoots the creature three times. As he returns to his car his identity is finally revealed: Agent Fox Mulder.|$|E
5|$|After {{putting on}} the crown, Finn becomes {{corrupted}} by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|E

50|$|As {{they lack}} a metabolism, {{constructs}} {{have a wide}} array of immunities to frailties and effects that would affect creatures of flesh and blood, such as poison, fatigue, exhaustion, disease or various special attacks and magical effects related to draining <b>a</b> <b>creature's</b> life energy (ability drain, level drain, death effects, etc.). As most constructs lack functional internal organs (their animating force does not require any) they are immune to critical hits and forms of damage targeting <b>a</b> <b>creature's</b> weak spots (such as a rogue's sneak attack).|$|R
5|$|However, the unfazed Eggman awakens <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> named Chaos from a huge gem {{called the}} Master Emerald. The animals fight {{a losing battle}} to {{retrieve}} the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named Tikal, who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected tales about <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently described an animal that, as recently as 1976, had entered their village, {{was the size of a}} cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. <b>A</b> <b>creature</b> forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

5|$|Most Democratic {{newspapers}} {{refused to}} support Bryan, the major exception being the New York Journal, controlled by William Randolph Hearst, whose fortune {{was based on}} silver mines. In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor. McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by big business. Even today, these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> of Hanna and others of his ilk.|$|E
5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> of Light and Brother Justin <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf {{did not respond to}} questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.|$|E

I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
50|$|In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy {{role-playing}} game, {{the vampire}} is <b>an</b> undead <b>creature.</b> <b>A</b> humanoid or monstrous humanoid <b>creature</b> can become <b>a</b> vampire, and looks {{as it did}} in life, with pale skin, haunting red eyes, and a feral cast to its features. A new vampire is created when another vampire drains the life out of <b>a</b> living <b>creature.</b>|$|R
50|$|Voidmind Creatures: <b>A</b> voidmind <b>creature</b> is <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} <b>creature</b> (such as <b>a</b> {{normal human}} or human-like creature or animal) whose mind has been nearly devoured by a mind flayer, but enough {{has been left}} intact for basic motor function. Further psionic rituals give these near dead <b>creatures</b> <b>a</b> semblance of life. The resulting creatures act as minions and spies for the Illithids.|$|R

5|$|The dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: certain {{creatures are}} natural enemies. For example, Flies and Spiders are often found {{at odds with}} one another. Common {{behaviours}} when <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> is angry include vandalising the dungeon and deserting the player. The creatures are varied in their statistics; some excel at certain tasks, and others refuse to perform certain tasks. Which creatures enter the dungeon depends on which rooms the player has and how large they are; most creatures have prerequisites for entering service. Creatures require paying regularly, and when 'Payday' comes, will head for the Treasure room to collect their wages. Other ways to obtain creatures include imprisoning and torturing them, 'scavenging' (persuaded to defect to the player) from enemy keepers, and performing certain sacrifices at the Temple. Creatures entering via the Portal are at the lowest experience level, and must gain experience, usually by training in the training room. Training creatures increases their attributes (such as hit points) and abilities (such as which spells they can cast). Such spells include lightning bolts, rebounding projectiles, and increasing armour. Creatures will frequently enter combat with heroes or creatures belonging to another keeper. Each creature has a star of the colour of the keeper it belongs to above it, displaying its experience level. The star is a health meter; as <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> takes damage, the spikes turn black. The player {{has the ability to}} possess <b>a</b> <b>creature,</b> seeing the dungeon from its first-person perspective and using its attacks and abilities. This is one of the spells; others include speeding creatures up, and healing them.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a skirmish mode, where other gods are battled {{for control of}} an island, a multiplayer mode over a local area network (LAN) or an online service, and The God's Playground, where gameplay aspects can be practised. In multiplayer mode, deathmatch and cooperative modes are available. In cooperative mode, players share <b>a</b> <b>creature.</b> Black & White includes a feature enabling the import of real weather.|$|E
5|$|The hoop snake, <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> {{of legend}} in the United States and Australia, {{is said to}} grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture {{includes}} a similar mythical creature, the Tsuchinoko. Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.|$|E
50|$|Hybrids- To combat Von Hunter, The Flaming Prince {{had several}} {{combinations}} of monsters created. These were: <b>a</b> goblin-orc <b>creature</b> (<b>a</b> fat goblin), a weresasquatch (<b>a</b> very hairy <b>creature</b> {{that would get}} even hairier during the full moon), and a combination of five dragons (a five-headed dragon whose heads attacked one another).|$|R

5|$|Thumbelina {{tries to}} protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old field mouse and tends her {{dwelling}} in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E
5|$|After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King help a {{being named}} Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals {{itself to be}} <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> of pure anti-magic. As such, the jewels from Ice King's crown are {{stripped}} of their magic, and Ice King reverts to his former self: Simon Petrikov (both voiced by Tom Kenny). Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{rights activists}} ransack a {{laboratory}} and unwittingly release <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> with a ferocious appetite. As they flee in an SUV, the creature follows and grotesquely mutilates them. The Fringe team consisting of FBI agents Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick), and civilian consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrives, and Walter sees evidence of different creatures' {{marks on the}} bodies. Olivia realizes {{one of them is}} missing, and after interviewing a student at MIT to try to identify the victims, she realizes they were animal rights activists. While conducting autopsies on the bodies, an animal control team at a different site is killed by the creature after investigating a call.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{also held}} {{that the level of}} <b>a</b> <b>creature's</b> {{perfection}} was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.|$|R

They have weaker inhibitions, and inhibition is {{the test of}} <b>a</b> <b>creature's</b> position in the mental scale." ...|$|R
60|$|Lizzie, {{as she sat}} {{thinking}} of it, owned to herself that no help {{was to be expected}} in that quarter. She was not angry with Miss Macnulty, who was, almost of necessity, <b>a</b> poor <b>creature.</b> But she was convinced more strongly than ever that some friend was necessary to her who should not be <b>a</b> poor <b>creature.</b> Lord Fawn, though a peer, was <b>a</b> poor <b>creature.</b> Frank Greystock she believed to be as strong as a house.|$|R
