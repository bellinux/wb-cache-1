However, not long after, he also received addresses from the free and freed settlers of Sydney and the Hawkesbury River region, {{with a total of}} 369 signatures, many made only with a cross, complaining that Macarthur did not represent them, as they blamed him for withholding sheep so as to raise the price of mutton.|$|E

In the Jacobite Rising of 1715 Lachlan Maclachlan of that Ilk [...] "signed the <b>Address</b> <b>of</b> <b>Welcome</b> to the Old Chevalier, the {{rightful}} King James VIII Stuart, on his landing in Scotland". Archibald Brown, in The History of Cowal, wrote, [...] "The chief of MacLachlan appeared with the Earl of Mar at Sheriffmuir as Colonel in the Pretender's army, and for this act it is said Campbell of Ardkinglas followed MacLachlan like a sleuthhound for five years and shot him dead in 1720".|$|E
500|$|When {{the newly}} {{established}} Confederate States of America met later that month in Montgomery to establish their formal union, Yancey was not a delegate, but he delivered the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to Jefferson Davis, selected as provisional President, on his arrival at Montgomery. While many of the fire-eaters were opposed to {{the selection of a}} relative moderate like Davis, Yancey accepted him as a good choice. [...] In his speech, Yancey indicated that in the selection of Davis, [...] "The man and the hour have met. [...] We now hope that prosperity, honor, and victory await his administration." [...] Many historians agree with Emory Thomas who wrote, [...] "When Yancey and Davis met in Montgomery the helm of the revolution changed hands. [...] Yancey and the radicals had stirred the waters; Davis and the moderates would sail the ship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me more than I can tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1870, {{after five}} years imprisonment, a {{commission}} {{was set up to}} investigate the Fenian prisoners, and on account of his bad health, this commission recommended that Dillon be allowed home to Cork. In January 1871 he was transferred to Millbank Prison London, and two weeks later on the 8th February he was set free. The following day he arrived in Dublin and after a few days rest, he returned to Cork by train. All along the route thousands of people waited on the platforms to greet him, and read special <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b> The train reached Cork at 8.00 p.m and even though a carriage and pair were waiting, he was glad to seek refuge in the first covered car he could find, so dense was the crowd all around him, willing to shake his hand. The triumphal procession from the station to his home then began, and the hills all along the route were lighted with tar barrels.|$|R

60|$|The speaker {{turned and}} gazed boldly into the {{carriage}} of the president. His arm remained extended aloft {{as if to}} sustain his peroration.

50|$|From the {{earliest}} days of colonial Queensland, governor's tours were more than familiarisation tours. They were both practical and ceremonial and received detailed coverage in the Queensland press. Tours encourage a sense of community within the places visited and was an opportunity to display progress made and to receive recognition for achievements. A vice-regal visit provided the chance to bring matters of local importance to the Governor's attention. The ceremonial and social aspects of governors' tours followed a similar pattern established in Britain during the late eighteenth century. Aspects included a reception by the local council, loyal addresses and the presentation of gifts and local curiosities. Visibility extended to eating in public. An interest in the welfare and progress of the people was demonstrated by laying foundation stones, taking an interest in children and performing ordinary activities in public. Following his welcome, the Governor was usually escorted into the town where he paused at the nearest official building, usually the court house, so that <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> could be made.|$|R
5000|$|On Sunday morning, June 6, for {{the first}} time in the history of Geneva a woman spoke in the National Church, the [...] Cathedral of St. Peter; A. Maude Royden of Great Britain preached in French and English to an {{audience}} that filled the cathedral. That morning at 9 Father Hall, sent by the Catholic ecclesiastical authorities from England for the purpose, delivered a sermon to the congress at a special mass in Notre Dame. In the afternoon, a reception was given by Emilie Gourd, president of the Swiss National Suffrage Association, in the Beau Sejour garden. At a public meeting in the evening at Plainpalais, M. J. Mussard, president of the Canton of Geneva; Chaponniere Chaix, president of the Swiss National Council of Women, and Mlle. Gourd gave <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> to which responses were made by Annie Furuhjelm, Finland; Mme. De Witt Schlumberger, France, and Anna Lindemann, Germany, officers of the Alliance. Catt then delivered her president's address. She described the physical, mental and moral chaos resulting from the war, the immense problems now to be solved.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the provincial Congress of Massachusetts, then in session at Watertown, had made {{arrangements for the}} expected arrival of Washington. It sent on a deputation which met Washington at Springfield, on the frontiers of the province, and provided escorts and accommodations for him along the road. Thus honorably attended from town to town, and escorted by volunteer companies and cavalcades of gentlemen, he arrived at Watertown on the 2d of July, where he was greeted by Congress with a congratulatory address, in which, however, was frankly stated the undisciplined state of the army he was summoned to command.

60|$|By {{this time}} General Poineau had {{explained}} matters {{to the band}} and they checked the national anthem abruptly {{in the middle of}} a bar, with the exception of the cornet player, who continued gallantly by himself till a feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him.

I do not wish my ayah to play with me. Go and eat rice." ...|$|E
50|$|The Congress was {{formally}} {{opened in the}} afternoon of 12 June with <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> from Anna Whitlock, acting president of the National Suffrage Association of Sweden, and the Hon. Ernest Beckman, M. P., president of the National Swedish Liberal Association, and response from the Alliance was made by Chrystal Macmillan of Great Britain, proxy for Millicent Garrett Fawcett, its first vice-president. Anna Kleman, president of the Stockholm suffrage society, then presented the beautiful white satin, gold embroidered Alliance banner, which was carried by six university students in white dresses with sashes of the Swedish colors. Catt announced that the Alliance flag was now flying over the Grand Hotel where they were assembled. The banner was the gift of Lotten von Kroemer, a pioneer suffragist of Sweden, and {{the flag of the}} resident Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Tea Co., US. A suffrage song written by K.G. Ossiannilsson and the music composed by Hugo Alfvén for the occasion was sung by the Women's Choir of Gothenburg, after which an official delegate of the Government extended its greeting while the audience rose and the flags of the nations waved from the galleries. Catt received an ovation as she came {{to the front of the}} platform to make her address. It filled twenty-three pages of the printed minutes and was a complete resume of the early position of women, the vast changes that had been wrought and the great work which the Alliance was doing.|$|R

They ascended the ladder together, while the ship fired a salute of twenty or thirty guns. They went into the cabin, and took seats there, with great ceremony. The minister then rose and made an <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to the English commander. Lord Sandwich replied, and there was then another thundering salute of cannon.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Mr. Scobell was {{exceedingly}} pleased with {{the scale of the}} reception, which to his mind amounted practically to pomp. The Palace Guard, forty strong, lined the quay. Besides these, there were four officers, a band, and sixteen mounted carbineers. The rest of the army was dotted along the streets. In addition to the military, there was a gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians, mainly drawn from fishing circles. The majority of these remained stolidly silent throughout, but three, more emotional, cheered vigorously as a young man was seen to step on to the gangway, carrying a grip, and make for the shore. General Poineau, a white-haired warrior with a fierce mustache, strode forward and saluted. The Palace Guards presented arms. The band struck up the Mervian national anthem. General Poineau, lowering his hand, {{put on a pair of}} pince-nez and began to unroll an <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b>|$|E
