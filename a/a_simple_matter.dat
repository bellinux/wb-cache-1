5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, it is <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, {{in the form of}} populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

It is not always <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> for members of an ensemble to determine the proper balance while playing; frequently, they require an outside listener, or a recording of their rehearsal, to tell them that the relations between the instruments are correct.|$|E
25|$|Uniting the Church of Byzantium {{with that}} of Rome was <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter,</b> since all the {{bargaining}} chips were {{in the hands of}} the Roman Catholic West. John VIII, as the de facto head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the Filioque dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in Ferrara and Florence, not only at the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.|$|E

25|$|At {{least one}} {{contributing}} mechanism for reduced spermatogenesis in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum {{is at least}} a couple of degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> of temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the story was published, detectives arrested Brooklyn Eagle {{reporter}} Francis A. Mallison who quickly confessed to {{his involvement in the}} hoax and implicated his editor as having organized the deception. Howard was arrested at his Brooklyn home and later made a full confession. Having an intimate knowledge of the newspaper industry, he knew that the price of gold would skyrocket if word got out of a delay in the war effort. He invested heavily in gold and, when he and Mallison used various couriers to plant the false information in the press the following morning, it was <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> for him to sell his shares once the price had risen enough for him to make a huge profit.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} analog computing was {{the development of}} the first fire-control systems for long range ship gunlaying. When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> of calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical analogue computer (called at the time the Argo Clock). It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I. The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.|$|E

Helle Rytkonen wrote in Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook 2007 that most of the debate around the cartoon controversy was over-simplified as <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> of free speech against religion. She said that the actual dispute was more nuanced, focusing on the tone of the debate and broader context of Western-Islamic relations.|$|E

500|$|Likewise, in his {{assessment}} of the German perspective at Arnhem, Robert Kershaw concluded that [...] "the battle on the Waal at Nijmegen {{proved to be the}} decisive event" [...] and that Arnhem became <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> of containment after the British had retreated into the Oosterbeek perimeter.

Heinz Harmel asserted that [...] "The Allies were stopped in the south just north of Nijmegen– that is why Arnhem turned out as it did." [...] Gavin himself commented that [...] "there was no failure at Arnhem.

500|$|Mathematically, {{proving that}} zero is even is <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> of {{applying}} a definition, but more explanation {{is needed in}} the context of education. One issue concerns the foundations of the proof; the definition of [...] "even" [...] as [...] "integer multiple of 2" [...] is not always appropriate. A student {{in the first years of}} primary education may not yet have learned what [...] "integer" [...] or [...] "multiple" [...] means, much less how to multiply with 0. Additionally, stating a definition of parity for all integers can seem like an arbitrary conceptual shortcut if the only even numbers investigated so far have been positive. It can help to acknowledge that as the number concept is extended from positive integers to include zero and negative integers, number properties such as parity are also extended in a nontrivial way.|$|E

500|$|In 1903 the {{brothers}} built the powered Wright Flyer I, using their preferred material for construction, spruce, {{a strong and}} lightweight wood, and Pride of the West muslin for surface coverings. They also designed and carved their own wooden propellers, and had a purpose-built gasoline engine fabricated in their bicycle shop. They thought propeller design would be <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> and intended to adapt data from shipbuilding. However, their library research disclosed no established formulae for either marine or air propellers, and they found themselves with no sure starting point. They discussed and argued the question, sometimes heatedly, until they concluded that an aeronautical propeller is essentially a wing rotating in the vertical plane. On that basis, they used data from more wind tunnel tests to design their propellers. The finished blades were just over eight feet long, made of three laminations of glued spruce. The Wrights decided on twin [...] "pusher" [...] propellers (counter-rotating to cancel torque), which would act on a greater quantity of air than a single relatively slow propeller and not disturb airflow over {{the leading edge of}} the wings.|$|E
