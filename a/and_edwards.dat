5|$|Stewart, Harvick <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> led at the lap 57 restart. Two laps later, Earnhardt <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> {{temporarily}} {{moved to}} the front of the field but Stewart retook the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, McMurray drove down from the top lane after exiting turn two, and went into Almirola in the middle lane, causing Almirola to make contact with Danica Patrick on the backstraightaway, sending her car spinning 180 degrees, and straight into the inside wall which she hit with her right-hand side, sustaining heavy damage to her car. The crash caused the third and final caution of the race to be shown. Patrick was unhurt; she was able to walk to an ambulance that took her to the in-field medical center. The field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Stewart the victory; Earnhardt finished second, and Ambrose finished third. Burton <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> completed the top five finishers. McDowell and Robby Gordon earned transfers to qualify for the Daytona 500. The first race had a total of three cautions and eight lead changes among five different drivers. Hamlin's total of 27 laps led was the most of any competitor. Stewart led three times for a total of 21 laps.|$|E

5|$|A September poll {{conducted}} by Clemson University found that 36% {{of the public}} {{had never heard of}} Joe Biden and only 44% had a favorable opinion of him.

His place was taken by Beverley Davies and Cardiff lost 17–3. John recovered {{in time for the}} South Africa against Wales match on 24 January, and was selected alongside Edwards. The game was played in atrocious muddy conditions, and a last minute try from Edwards snatched a 6–6 draw Both John <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> had a substandard game that day, but they combined well in the last move of the game to avoid defeat. A week later on 31 January, John <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> faced the South Africans again, this time as part of the Barbarians.

5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} in the atoll is sparse, {{because of}} the lack of fresh water. Only two species of vascular plant are currently known to grow there one of the smallest such floras on any island. Acadia, Pandora <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> Islets are forested with Heliotropium foertherianum, but Westward Islet is not. Pemphis acidula has also been recorded on Ducie; specimens were found during an expedition in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E
5|$|England {{travelled}} to Australia and New Zealand {{in early}} 2008 attempting {{to improve on}} their previous visits. In ten ODI matches in Australia against their hosts previously, England had only managed one win, while against New Zealand they had won just three of fifteen contests. England started badly, losing two of their warm-up matches by significant margins, and then falling 21 runs short in the Twenty20 match which opened the series. Taylor top-scored for England in their Twenty20 defeat with 34 runs from 32 balls. She made a similar score in the first ODI match against the hosts, but in the second match both Taylor <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> were out for ducks in a heavy defeat for England. After the third match of the series was abandoned without any play, Taylor scored her first half-century of the tour, and shared a century partnership with Edwards to help England secure a 2–1 lead in the series, guaranteeing that they would at least draw the five-match contest. After Australia won the last ODI to tie the series, the two sides met at the Bradman Oval to play the only Test of the tour. Taylor <b>and</b> <b>Edwards</b> again enjoyed a successful partnership in England's first innings; Taylor scored 79 runs as the pair put on 159 together. She scored an unbeaten half-century in the second innings to help England to retain the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 John left Llanelli RFC for Cardiff RFC {{and here}} he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards that {{became one of the}} most famous half-back pairings in world rugby.
