5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way off the ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E

25|$|Aerobraking {{allows a}} {{spacecraft}} {{to reduce the}} high point of an elliptical orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at the low point of the orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits, heating is comparatively minor, and <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> is not required. This has been done on several Mars missions such as Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and at least one Venus mission, Magellan.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the request}} of USAF Chief Scientist, a less radical {{modification}} of the Arrow than the PS-2 was pursued which became the Mark 4. The revised intakes of the Mark 3 were retained, but with smaller Curtiss-Wright ramjets, without the canards and nose extension, and with a titanium skin instead of <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield.</b> Performance was reduced to Mach 3 and [...] maximum combat altitude of 80,000 feet.|$|E
2500|$|The final defined water {{mass in the}} Arctic Ocean {{is called}} Arctic Surface Water and is found from [...] The most {{important}} feature of this water mass is a section {{referred to as the}} sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the Siberian Shelf. As it is entrained, it cools and acts <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3-0.6m/s. Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.|$|E
2500|$|Aerocapture is a {{much more}} {{aggressive}} manoeuver, converting an incoming hyperbolic orbit to an elliptical orbit in one pass. [...] This requires <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> and much trickier navigation, because it must be completed in one pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at least one more propulsive maneuver is required after aerocapture—otherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not yet been tried on a planetary mission, but the re-entry skip by Zond 6 and Zond 7 upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they turned a hyperbolic orbit into an elliptical orbit. On these missions, because there was no attempt to raise the perigee after the aerocapture, the resulting orbit still intersected the atmosphere, and re-entry occurred at the next perigee.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, the United States {{announced}} Project Mercury, {{with the}} goal of sending men into low Earth orbit, and selected a group of seven astronauts to pilot them. The single-man capsule was designed and patented by a team led by Maxime Faget. [...] The McDonnell Aircraft company won the contract to build Mercury. The cone-shaped capsule was 6 ft in diameter with <b>a</b> blunt-body <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> at the base. Total capsule length was 10.8 ft, including a retrorocket pack strapped over the <b>heat</b> <b>shield.</b> The heaviest capsule had a gross weight of 3000 lb, and was capable of just over one day of orbital flight. A 24.1 ft-long launch escape tower was connected to the nose of the capsule at launch, containing a solid-fueled rocket capable of carrying the capsule away from the launch vehicle in case of an emergency. Capsules for suborbital flights used <b>a</b> radiative <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> made of beryllium and were launched with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle. Orbital capsules used <b>an</b> ablative <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> made of fiberglass embedded in an aluminum honeycomb matrix, and were launched with the Atlas LV-3B.|$|R
40|$|Exploratory {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with several conceptual radiative <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> of composite construction. Measured transient temperature distributions were obtained for <b>a</b> graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation and with three types of insulating materials, and for <b>a</b> metal multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> at surface temperatures of approximately 2, 000 F and 1, 450 F, respectively, by use of a radiant-heat facility. The graphite configurations suffered loss of surface material under repeated irradiation. Temperature distribution calculated for the metal <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> by <b>a</b> numerical procedure was in good agreement with measured data. Environmental survival tests of the graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation, <b>an</b> insulated multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> and <b>a</b> stainless-steel-tile <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> were made at temperatures of 2, 000 F and dynamic pressures of approximately 6, 000 lb/sq ft, provided by an ethylene-heated jet operating at a Mach number of 2. 0 and sea-level conditions. The graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> survived the simulated aerodynamic heating and pressure loading. A problem area exists {{in the design and}} materials for heat-resistant fasteners between the graphite shield and the base structure. The insulated multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> was found to be superior to the stainless-steel-tile <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> in retarding <b>heat</b> flow. Over-lapped face-plate joints and surface smoothness of the insulated multi- post <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> were not adversely affected by the test environment. The graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation survived tests made in the acoustic environment of a large air jet. This acoustic environment is random in frequency and has an overall noise level of 160 decibels...|$|R
50|$|Snow Tracs in {{use today}} are often {{modified}} and {{it is common to}} find overheating problems plague these machines because <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> have been removed {{to make it easier to}} work on engines. There were 2 primary types of <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> that were installed in Snow Tracs, <b>a</b> vertical <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> that divided the engine compartment fore and aft or <b>a</b> horizontal <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> that separated the muffler area from the rest of the engine compartment. In either case the function was ultimately the same, to keep the exhaust and muffler heat away from the engine. The vertical <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> seems to have been commonly utilized on the Royal Marines and N.A.T.O. versions of the Snow Trac, it may have also been used on civilian versions. The horizontal <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> is the most commonly found on Snow Tracs.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{before the}} Arrow first flew, Avro was {{designing}} a future version, the Mark 3. [...] Originally designed for Mach 2.5, later revised {{to an estimated}} Mach 3 with a combat ceiling of 70,500 feet, it carried more fuel, weighed over 25% more than the Mk.2, and made greater use of CNC machining and high-temperature aluminum alloys. Also proposed was <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> forming an ablative insulation made from carbon fibre or fiberglass in a honeycomb matrix, later used on NASA's Mercury and Gemini programs. The engine {{was to be the}} Iroquois Mk.3, which Orenda estimated would provide 40,000lbs of wet thrust (with afterburner). Images of the design show revised engine intakes projecting out from the fuselage to swallow the supersonic shock wave to reduce drag and increase thrust. Also proposed was capability for [...] "probe and drogue" [...] aerial refuelling made possible by the Arrow's revolutionary flight stability systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} was cone shaped, with a neck at {{the narrow}} end. It had a convex base, which carried <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> (Item 2 in the diagram below) consisting of an aluminum honeycomb covered with {{multiple layers of}} fiberglass. Strapped to it was a retropack (1) consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry. Between these were three minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion. The straps that held the package could be severed when {{it was no longer}} needed. Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment (3). Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments {{in front of him and}} with his back to the heat shield. Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat, scrubbing the air of CO2, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine. The recovery compartment (4) at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: a drogue to stabilize free fall and two main chutes, a primary and reserve. Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing. On top of the recovery compartment was the antenna section (5) containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation. Attached was a flap used to ensure [...] the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry. A launch escape system (6) was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule's parachute for a landing nearby at sea. (See also Mission profile for details.) ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Stevens began {{producing}} {{both the}} Model 520A (renamed the Model 520-30) and the Model 620A (labeled as the Model 620) as trench guns, riot guns, and long-barreled training guns for the US military. [...] Trench guns were produced with 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) and had <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> {{with a unique}} pinkish anodized bayonet lug attached {{to the front of}} the barrel (late war examples had a small [...] "S" [...] stamped on the left side).

[...] Model 520-30 trench gun barrels are marked [...] "Proof Tested--12 Gauge --2 3/4 Inch Chamber--" [...] on the left side and have another small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb and the [...] "J Stevens Arms Company" [...] address on the right side of the barrel. [...] This was done so that all the markings could be read with the heat shield installed. [...] Some Model 620 trench gun barrels were marked in the same manner as the Model 520-30 trench guns and some had all the barrel markings on the left side. [...] Trench guns were also fitted with a sling swivel in the stock. [...] Riot guns also had 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) and had all the same martial markings, except that all the barrel markings were on the left side. [...] The long barreled training guns were marked in the same manner as riot guns and were mainly used for aerial gunnery training. [...] Total wartime production of all Model 520-30 shotguns was 33,306 and all Model 620 shotguns was 12,174. [...] After the war the US military standardized both the Model 520-30 and the Model 620 and kept them in the inventory. [...] They were used in the Korean War and as late as the Vietnam War.|$|E

50|$|Space {{capsules}} {{have typically}} been smaller than 5 m in diameter, {{although there is}} no engineering limit to larger sizes.
